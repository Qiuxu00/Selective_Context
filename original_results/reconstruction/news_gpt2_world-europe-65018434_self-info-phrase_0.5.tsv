The draft document did not include any mention of Ukraine's military, or that of other nations.
The Ukrainian government was not mentioned by name. It was not even mentioned by name.
The EU's Defence Ministers told the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that they had not been given permission to read the document to the court. The ICJ has already heard hundreds of legal arguments over Ukraine's sovereignty, over the military, over the use of force and the use of money.
The legal arguments have been heard by a group of 4 judges (including the head of the ICJ) in the Hague, which is being led by the judge, Josef Stoltenberg. In the case of Ukraine, the judges have said that they were not allowed to read the document and that they did not read it to the court.
The lawyers for the Ukrainian government, which is in charge of the armed forces, have argued that it was not a legitimate military body
The judge on the case says that the court's ruling was without merit.
The judge also says that he does not think the ruling is binding.
Asked what he thinks the court should do because it was not a legitimate body, Stoltenberg says: "I don't think it was binding."
The judges on the case say that they are not yet satisfied with the decision.
