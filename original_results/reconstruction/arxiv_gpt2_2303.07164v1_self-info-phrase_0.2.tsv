A number of the statements in (x, e, n, t), (b, c), (d, x), (e, d), (f, e), (g, f=1, g=2) are not explicitly quoted. It is interesting to note that the (examples) of (x=1, x=2, x=3, x=4), (x=5, x=6), (x=7, x=8), and (3=8, x=9) are not quoted.

In particular, two of the statements are not explicitly quoted. The first statement, (x=1, x=2, x=3), is not quoted. (x=4, x=5, x=6) is not quoted. (x=7, x=8, x=9) is not quoted. (x=10, x=11, x=12) is not quoted. (x=13, x=14, x=15) is not quoted. (x=16, x=17, x=18) is not quoted. The paragraph for (x=1, x=2, x=3) is not quoted. The statement for (x=1, x=2, x=3) is not quoted. The paragraph for (x=1, x=2, x=3) is not quoted. (x=4, x=5, x=6) is not quoted. (x=7, x=8, x=9) is not quoted. (x=10, x=11, x=12) is not quoted. (x=13, x=14, x=15) is not quoted. (x=16, x=17, x=18) is not quoted. (x=19, x=20, x=21) is not quoted. (x=22, x=23, x=24) is not quoted. (x=25, x=26, x=
