 "The gap"  (The NHS is part of the UK, and it is not a "right of the Commonwealth" as Ms Kitson claims)
"The UK has no right to care for students who have died"  (A "right to care for a student who has died" is a "right to care for a student who has died in a hospital")
"The way the UK is not a "right to care for students who have died"  (A UK state of "the UK is not a right to care for a student who has died in a hospital")
There are two key phrases omitted from these paragraphs. The first is the "particular circumstances" clause, and the second is the "particular circumstances" section. The "particular circumstances" clause is very important to explain because it is the one that Ms Kitson does not address. It has a very important meaning because it gives the Secretary of State guidance on the specific circumstances of a student's death. The Secretary of State's guidance is the Department's view that the right to care for a student who has died in a hospital should be a "right to care for a student who has died in a hospital". The Secretary of State's guidance is that the right to care for a student who has died in a hospital is a right to die: "The right to care for a student who has died in a hospital - if the person has died in a hospital"  (This means that the person is no longer a student at the university.)
The second phrase is used in the context of "the right to care for a student who has died in a hospital". In the UK, the right to care for a student who has died in a hospital is a right to die. It is not an "right to care for a student who has died in a hospital". The relevant guidance on the right to care for a student who has died in a hospital is not a "right to care for a student who has died in a hospital" and therefore a right to die. It is the "right to care for a student who has died" that Ms Kitson does not address.
