The committee has reviewed the matter and the rules at the request of the Speaker of the House and said it was not subject to any review by the House of Commons.

It said it had reviewed "the public's interests" while not ruling Mr Johnson guilty of any wrongdoing.

Mr Johnson has been accused of being too close to government and has been called into question by his former colleagues and his staff as he has sought to "confuse the public" and "disconnect" from his party.

The committee heard that Mr Johnson's former cabinet minister, Stephen Kinnock, was "confused" by allegations that he had been a close ally of Mr Johnson during a Cabinet Office meeting on immigration.
