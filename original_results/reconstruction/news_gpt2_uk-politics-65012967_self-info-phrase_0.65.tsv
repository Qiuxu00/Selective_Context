The Committee's report said that while there was a strong bias in favor of the press and judges in its findings, that it did not influence the outcome of the proceedings. The Committee's report found that there was a strong bias in favor of the press and judges in its findings, but said that there was more bias against the media and judges in its verdicts. It said there was an important proportion of the jury's deliberations and decision making to favour the media and judges more than those favoring the press and judges. The Committee said the court's conclusions that media and judges were more likely to favour the media and judges were not the evidence of the public's preference for the media and judges. The Committee said the court's findings did not support the press and judge bias, but did support the media and judges' view of the media and judges."

The Committee, as it was known, had not been given time to review the matter. The committee, in its report, said it was informed this week by Mr Johnson's solicitor general, Mark Rowley, who had been told by the Attorney General's office, the government was not required to review the matter.

Mr Johnson was told this week he was not to be interviewed by the Foreign Office about the allegations.

The investigation, which is being undertaken by the Serious Fraud Office, will be one of the most sensitive areas of the inquiry. It is being led by Lord Greenhalgh, a former criminal justice barrister, and his three co-defendants, Lord Greenhalgh's legal team and Mr Justice Black.

It is understood that Mr Johnson will now be asked to answer the questions, which will be published today.

Mr Johnson will also be asked to provide an explanation for his actions which were caught on video. It is understood he said he was not a party to the allegations, but he was not given a reason why he should not have.

The court ruled Mr Johnson had breached the law by failing to tell MPs he intended to "pay the fine" but he was not sentenced.
