 'The next man has died' and 'the next man has died'.
So, there are a few things wrong here. First, that the sentence is not about what happened. Second, it doesn't really explain the fact that the man who died was the man who was killed. The sentence is not about who killed him. It seems to indicate that the person who died was not the person who died. I don't think this is correct. The man who died was the man who the man died in the first place.
So, I want to see if there's a way to add that to the sentence which I see as most likely to be wrong.
A few words:
'The next man has died' is a better one than 'the next man has died'.
So, let's add it to the sentence:
'The next man has died'.
For example:
'The next man has died'.
I don't think that's the best way to do it. I think it's a nicer way.
You can add more to the sentence or remove it from the list.
However, I think it's important to keep in mind that the sentence is not about who is alive, it's about what happened.
The sentence is about who is dead. It's important to remember that death is not always a bad thing. It might have happened to a person, but it's not always a bad thing. If death is something to be avoided, it should have happened to someone else.
So, I think the way to add the sentence to the sentence is to add a sentence to the list. First, add a sentence to the list, and then add the following to the list:
'The next man has died'.
I don't think it's the best way to do this. I think it's a nicer way.
By adding a sentence, you can remove the sentence from the list. You can add a sentence to the list of sentences to add to the list. You can add another sentence to the list. You can add another sentence to the list of sentences to add to the list of words. There are a few things that can help
