The 21-year-old said that after the crash she became "very, very sad" with a "worrisome" feeling she had lost her job.

"I was so sad that I was going to miss a day of my life, so I took a day off, there was a little bit of a moment when I realised it wasn't going to happen, I was getting to have a rest and the day of that I had a little bit of a day off I had thought I'm going to miss school, I think that's what I think now," said Ms Corria.

However, she said that it has given her an "incredibly long and happy dream" that she will be able to travel to the competition again.

She and her husband John, also a former beauty queen, were running a campaign in the UK to encourage people to participate in Miss World.

It was one of eight campaigns to raise more than £100,000 to help others find an alternative.

Miss Corria said: "I had a moment of sadness, I think I said to myself, 'I don't think I'm going to go back to school right now'.

"There was a moment of sadness you couldn't see it, it just felt like there was a real possibility there wouldn't be, but it's so hard to face it and it's been so beautiful to see that I'm in the dream of it, I'll never forget it, I don't think I could have imagined it.

"For those of you out there you can't imagine there is a chance, this thing is just the best version after struggling my mental and physical recovery my dreams have come true I can go on and on and on, I'm happy for everybody to participate in the Miss World competition," she added.
