 take up the issue and try to bring a more comprehensive approach to our legislation," she said. "The current law does not make it clear that the legal duty of care is to protect students from harm." The LEARN Network has been campaigning for years to create legal duty of care for students, and campaigners say such legislation could be introduced if the UK government were to adopt it. Libby Kitson said: "The UK Government has been trying to reform the law for some time, but has not been able to solve the problems that we face. "There is no easy solution to the problem. The Government will not legislate on this issue, but I do think that our government would do well to take this issue seriously and to look at proposals like this, and to have that kind of conversation."

The LEARN Network's campaign to bring about a legal duty of care for students has resulted in over two million signatures and a petition calling for the UK government to adopt it.
