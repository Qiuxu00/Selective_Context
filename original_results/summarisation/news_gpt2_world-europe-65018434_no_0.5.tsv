ising $1.1bn (£7.6bn) of new military aid for Ukraine to be used by the EU to prevent further Ukrainian military action. That is part of a £1bn (£8.7bn) set up by the UK, France and Germany to support Ukraine's efforts to push for peace. Germany has insisted it is not against sending arms to Ukraine, but in the past week has been caught on tape with the armed forces of Ukraine accusing Moscow of backing rebels fighting a Russian-backed government in eastern Ukraine. In April, Germany ordered the evacuation of 30,000 civilians from the Ukrainian port city of Bakhmut after Russian tanks blocked roads. Ukraine has denied having any intention of sending weapons to the conflict. A Ukrainian military source said the army was ready to send weapons to Ukrainian forces by April 23. Reuters reported earlier this year that Russia has sent its first armoured personnel carrier to Ukraine, a move that could create a humanitarian crisis in the country. The deployment is expected to last three months. The source said the Ukrainian military had been preparing for the move for some time, but that the army had no plans to send weapons to Ukraine. The source said Russia had not ordered the evacuation of the people but had planned to send a special team to Donetsk, the town where two other rebel groups are based. "We are not ready to send arms to Crimea as it would create a humanitarian crisis," the source said. A spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military declined to comment. Reuters reported on Monday that the first batch of 1,000 Ukrainian Army P-47K anti-tank anti-aircraft missiles had been delivered to Donetsk on Saturday. Ukraine has been preparing to send armoured personnel carriers to the conflict zone for months, but only after the Russian army said it was ready to send its first military aircraft. Reuters reported on Tuesday that European Union and Ukrainian officials had reached an agreement on a plan to send 1,000 weapons to Ukraine by April. The EU said it agreed to provide 100,000 anti-tank ammunition to Ukraine. The EU also has asked the Ukrainian military to deploy a special unit to the region to protect civilians.
