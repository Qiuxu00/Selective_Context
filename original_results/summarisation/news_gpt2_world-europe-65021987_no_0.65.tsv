 has lost its ability to control its nuclear arsenal. The US, France and others have warned that Ukraine's warplanes are now targeting and killing civilians as they try to gain access to Crimea. Russia has been pushing Kiev to abandon its nuclear arsenal. Some US officials say that Moscow is prepared to use its nuclear arsenal to defend itself from the Ukrainian crisis and to attack any attempts to force Ukraine to break off its military alliance with Russia. The head of the White House's nuclear policy advisory council, Jay Carney, said in a speech last week that Russia's nuclear ambitions were "totally unacceptable" to the world and that "we must not give the impression that we're just taking a step backwards". "The world needs nuclear weapons," the US defence secretary, Ashton Carter, said. A Pentagon report last month said that Russia had already used "slightly more than 1,000" nuclear warheads in that period.

Moscow's warplanes have recently carried out several air strikes near Sevastopol, a key military base in Crimea, as well as a number of air strikes against its territory near the east, according to US officials.

The US has been in the midst of an intense diplomatic effort to deal with the situation in Crimea, which has become a flashpoint for Russia's conflict with Ukraine.

The US has accused Russia of having used chemical weapons in the summer of 2014, and an investigation into allegations of Russian involvement in the attack has been launched by the Pentagon.

Western countries have also said the attack was not a military operation, and that it was carried out by a "strategic air force".

"The United States is not going to have much to do with the operation or the decision to deploy it, or even the decision to deploy it," said Thomas Kean, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a presentation to the National Security Council.

The US Defense Intelligence Agency has also said that Russia's use of weapons of mass destruction against Ukraine was an "ongoing matter".

The US and Russia have also been trying to link the events of last month. The US has been under pressure from Washington to change its nuclear policy after an August decision by the United Nations Security
