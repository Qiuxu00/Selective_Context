The European Security and Defence Council (ESD) approved the agreement to supply ammunition to Ukraine on Thursday after a meeting in Brussels on the same topic.

The ESD said it wanted to ensure the "exceptionally high" level of security in the country and "not just to ensure that the ammunition is available for the Ukrainian army in the field".

The ESD said it will also set up a regular security panel to consider the agreement and ensure the safety of Ukrainian citizens in the country.

The European Security and Defence Council (ESD) approved the agreement to supply ammunition to Ukraine on Thursday after a meeting in Brussels on the same topic.

The ESD said it will also set up a regular security panel to consider the agreement and ensure the safety of Ukrainian citizens in the country.

The agreement is in line with the EU's decision on Ukraine's armed forces' use of force.

The ESD said it supports the use of force against Russian forces.

"The Ukrainian government has the right to demand a ceasefire between its forces and the separatists. The Ukrainian armed forces are acting in accordance with the rules of international law, but the Ukrainian government has declared a state of war and has committed atrocities against its own people," the statement said.

The ESD said it supports the use of force against Russian forces.

"There is no justification for the use of force against the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian government does not agree to abide by international law," it said.

Ukraine's defense minister has said that if Russia does not meet its demands, it will use force.

In a short speech on Wednesday, Ukrainian defence minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said that while Ukraine's armed forces were not going to use force against Russian forces, he was concerned that they were not ready to use such force.
