The Committee's report, which began in March 2016, found the system of committee rules was 'unfair and inappropriate'. It added that the chairman's decision to make redactions was made in a 'highly unusual' and 'highly inappropriate way', and that 'his decision to make redactions was based on a personal belief that there were risks to any credibility of the witness' It said the committee was 'possible that he or he may have been influenced by what the witness said' the committee had also found the chair was aware of the'substantial, very serious and highly unusual' nature of the rules Mr Johnson's name was added to the inquiry. Mr Johnson's defence has been that the evidence was 'purely because it was requested' but it appears he did not realise the scope and seriousness of the case. It has been suggested that as a result of the chairman's decision, but he has previously denied this and said he was aware of his legal position. However, the committee's report had been reviewed by other MPs and found the findings were 'unfortunate', that it did not seek any criminal charge and that Mr Johnson's legal team had 'an excellent understanding of the system' and the committee had 'never considered a criminal charge'. It was also found the chairman had a 'uniquely high level of knowledge of the law' and had 'no basis for suggesting that he was aware of the system in which the witness was prepared' The committee concluded that, based on the evidence presented by Mr Johnson, it concluded that Mr Johnson was 'likely' to be prosecuted under the Serious Fraud Act. Mr Johnson had earlier said he was "not aware of that" but the committee also found he 'had no basis for suggesting that we were going to prosecute him'. However, in February 2015 the matter was sent to the Labour MP, who said he was "not aware of the system" but was "not aware of the case that he was charged with, that he might be charged with serious offences of the sort we have seen". Mr Johnson has denied the allegation. He said that had he been charged he would have been charged with a crime in the first place. He said he had no idea what it would be.
