There are some things a Ukraine, not a European nation, can do to help its neighbours

-

The story behind that story was a bit more complicated than I expected.

The United Nations says it has requested $2bn in Ukraine's defence budget for 2014 - its first in years. It also has a request for $1bn for more than 1,200 Ukrainian ships and submarines to be built.

The EU has more money for its own defence procurement than the Ukrainian government.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has said the aid money will not only put Ukraine in the back of the queue but also will be used to rebuild the country's infrastructure.

He also said he was confident that more money would be handed over.

It was not immediately clear what that money would be.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry has said it was already prepared to send a second batch of about 200,000 T-34s with heavy weapons to Ukraine.

Russia is also planning to send the same number of T-34s with Kalibr weaponry - which it has already delivered.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said it had no idea what the money was being sent for.

A spokesperson for the Kremlin said it was "not aware if the money is being sent for an increase in the amount of Ukrainian defense procurement".

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said it had received a request from the Ukrainian government for two months to supply Ukrainian ships in Ukraine with heavy weapons.

The ministry said it had received the request because Russian warships are being deployed to the country.
