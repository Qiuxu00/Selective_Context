 is under pressure from its allies to protect its naval base from an attack by a self-defence government, which Russian military sources say is backed by Russia's president. Mr Putin said Russia was ready to protect its naval base from an attack. In an interview with NBC news, Mr Aksyonov said the attack was part of a continuing anti-Russian campaign. The Kremlin has also accused Kiev of deliberately targeting Ukrainian ships as part of its military campaign on the peninsula. The attack is believed to have been carried out by the Russian navy. The Russian military denied the claims. At the same time, the government of Ukraine says it has no intention of launching air strikes because of the threat to its security. The military has said it is ready to defend its territory after the attack, the BBC's Jonathan Head says. However, it says it will keep fighting as part of a wider effort to regain control of the peninsula. Russia's defence ministry said it was monitoring the situation closely.

'It's clear that this is an attempt to make it harder for Ukraine to defend its borders'

"This is a blatant attempt by the Ukrainian military to take control of territory in an attempt to force it to return to a normal form of relations with the west. It is clear that this is an attempt to make it harder for Ukraine to defend its borders," said a statement from the ministry. "This has been a long time coming, and it is clear that this is an attempt to make it harder for Ukraine to defend its borders."

But Russia's military chief said this was not a military operation. He said it was "an act of aggression designed to destabilise Ukraine".

The Russian military is not officially part of a formal military alliance with the West.

Moscow's security services and its Western partners are a major source of funding for the Kremlin, but so are its armed forces.

In a statement, the Russian military said its "current programme of operations are aimed at fulfilling the strategic objective of the Russian Federation".

The statement said it would hold regular exercises to strengthen its military capabilities and to take part in the military exercises.

Ukraine's Defence Ministry said it was aware of the latest incident
