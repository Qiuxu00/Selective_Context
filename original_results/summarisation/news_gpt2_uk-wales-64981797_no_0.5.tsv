 Swansea would be a good time to get back to work. But Darcey says it is hard to take the leap after four months of rehabilitation. "I'm still recovering and it's sad. But I'm just not good enough for the next five to seven weeks." Darcey said in her blog post, "I still have so much to learn. I still have to be a better actress. I still have to be a better mother. I still have the courage to be myself and be a part of my family. I still have to be a better mother and a better father. And I still have to be a better self. I still have to be a better girl and a better mother. I still have to be a better woman and I still have to be a better person."
