 At the time of the inquiry's launch, the chief executive of Covid UK, David Hart, said he believed there was enough evidence for its review. He added: "The Committee is committed to ensuring the integrity of Covid's processes, which include the collection of data about the use of government buildings, ensuring that the use of the UK's public services is legal, and that public sector agencies are not subject to judicial oversight. So we would look at all the evidence available and find that it would be in the best interests of Covid UK to publish information relating to these matters." The inquiry has been looking at the use of Covid's lockdowns, which can affect the security of the building or the lives of staff. There have been reports of other similar incidents, including a number of security breaches on some Government buildings, in which staff have been targeted. But Mr Johnson has been repeatedly criticised for failing to take action on the issue. He was forced to apologise after the Commons' security committee held an open forum in September, and was given a standing ovation from outside the chamber. He has publicly pledged to "do everything to protect the integrity of my work". In his speech, Mr Johnson said there was no room for complacency and that there was no need for "a witch-hunt". In June, a Labour MP said he had been told by Mr Johnson he could not be removed from the committee. Tory MP Diane Abbott said the committee was "an arm's length from Downing Street" and "a good body that looks after the people of our country". In his speech, Mr Johnson also questioned the integrity of the Commons' independent review of the use of government buildings. "I think the question is whether the Committee will be able to get on with their work without fear or favour," he said. The committee is expected to publish its findings on 22 December. But it does not yet have the power to order Mr Johnson to apologise. The Commons' press office said it was "confident" the inquiry would be open before the end of April. But it has also said it is open to a number of changes if Mr Johnson is found to have misled Parliament, including the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into
