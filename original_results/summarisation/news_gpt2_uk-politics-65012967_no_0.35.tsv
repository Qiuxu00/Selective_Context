 The Labour MP Tom Watson, who was at the time a member of the committee, said he knew no "bad" behaviour and he was "quite shocked" by the news. He said there had been "a lot of bad behaviour on the streets of London" but that "there's no doubt that the prime minister has been pretty clear about the truth". The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, was in London on Friday when an explosion rocked the city. "It's a fantastic day," he said. He was carrying a large party banner. The mayor's office said he would be in London to support Mr Johnson. The mayor's office said he was in his first week in office but that he was due to be in London in September. He was not in London on Friday.

Mr Johnson's office said he was in his first week in office but that he was not in London on Friday. There was an explosion in the London Tube station early on Saturday, leaving 11 people injured. The government said it was investigating whether the blast was a terrorist attack. At least six other people have been injured in the line of duty. Mr Johnson spoke at the launch of a new inquiry into the use of the power of the House of Lords and the use of the House of Lords by Cabinet ministers. The inquiry is set up by the Prime Minister, the Commons Speaker, the Home Secretary and the Speaker of the House of Lords. "My message to MPs is, just because you are a prime minister, does not mean you have to be a public servant," he said. "You have to be accountable to the people and to the people's elected representatives. We need to find out why the abuse happened and why it is happening to our country." The inquiry will look at the use of the House of Lords to house ministers. One witness, who asked not to be named, said: "We were in a position to have a call with the Prime Minister. We could have a call with the Speaker but the Speaker just refused to come. We had a call with the Speaker, and he said, 'No. You don't want to get on with this.' Why, why didn't we want to get on with it? Why
