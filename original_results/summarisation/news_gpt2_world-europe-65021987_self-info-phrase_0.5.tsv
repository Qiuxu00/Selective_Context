It's a shame what happened after that.

This is a bit of a mess and I hope not.

I'll have to go back to the topic of the Russian-backed separatists.

It's not just the Ukrainians who are the target of this.

The whole thing is just a distraction.

Russia, like the rest of the world, has been very much in the dark about the separatists.

The Russian government has very much said, well, we don't know.

And the Obama administration has yet to respond to it.

And even though the White House has not been silent on the issue, the Ukrainian ambassador has been on the record.

That's my problem.

We're not going to be able to make a new deal with Russia.

We must wait until Ukraine becomes a regional economic powerhouse before we can make a proper agreement.
