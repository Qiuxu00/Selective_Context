Ukrainian military claims to have launched two strikes on a Russian military base in what appears to be a training exercise "within Ukrainian territory", but its claim is also unconfirmed and not confirmed by Reuters.

The first strike, which occurred on Tuesday in the village of Tl;dr, was carried out by military aircraft as part of a joint US-Ukraine operation.

The other strike was carried out on Saturday, in the village of Pskov, in the former Soviet republic of the same name.

Reports said the first strike came from the military air base of the Russian Federation's Federal Security Service, which is based in the Black Sea city of Novoazovsk.

The base is located in a rural area of the former Soviet republic of the Crimean Peninsula.

The Russian military said there had been no direct military intervention by Ukraine's military against the country's forces.

It said a Ukrainian military source said the first strike was carried out by a Russian military aircraft.

The second strike, which took place in the town of Yivaty, in the Black Sea city of Yevheniyevsk, was carried out by a Russian military aircraft as part of a joint US-Ukraine operation.

It was not clear whether the first strike was carried out by a Russian air force.

On Saturday, Defence Minister Vitaly Churkin said in a statement on the latest strike that "Ukrainians continue to be the only victims of Russian aggression in the region".

"We are confident of the truth of the allegations, and we will defend ourselves against all accusations," he said.
