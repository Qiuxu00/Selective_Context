If you want to use a proof that is a theorem of some sort, you have to explicitly define the proof for that theorem.

The proof is defined as follows:

$$ \begin{equation} \\ \begin{align*} \epsilon A = \left(\frac{\left[ A \right]^\pi \right]}\right)^\pi \left\frac{\left[ A \right]^\pi \right] \end{align*} $$

In general, to define a proof for a theorem, you have to define an additional proof that is a proof of the theorem.

The additional proof is a proof that is a proof for one or more of the following two conditions:

A theorem of some type is true if and only if the theorem is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true if and only if it is true

Proof of the theorem is true
