ising military action against Russia, according to the National Security Council, which has approved the use of Russian military forces. The move follows a US-led campaign to stop the flow of weapons to rebels in eastern Ukraine in the past two months.

'No reason to be surprised' Ukraine's Defence Minister said his country will be using its military might to defend itself against any Russian encroachment

'The most effective way of dealing with the Ukraine situation are the use of force' Ukraine's Defence Minister said the US-led campaign was "no reason to be surprised" as it was already in force.

"We are using our military might to defend ourselves so we can respond," he said, adding that his country already had deployed some of its armed forces in eastern and southern Ukraine. "It is clear that we are not going to use our military might. It's a no-brainer to use our military might to defend ourselves so we can respond." Ukraine has said it will not be armed with the Russian army's arsenal if Russia is not satisfied with its actions.

US President Barack Obama described Monday's move as "the biggest military exercise yet" on the part of Russia by a third of the US military in Europe.

The US has said it will spend about $3bn (£2.5bn) to secure Ukraine's military assets, but Putin and others argue that it will be expensive. A U.S. defence official said the latest purchase of more than 1.5 million artillery shells and other equipment was a "major step forward" in the US initiative.

Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said his country will be using its "armament capacity" in the Ukraine campaign to counter Russian encroachment.

"We are ready to face any Russian aggression. We will provide all necessary weapons, including the necessary equipment. We will provide support for our troops in the offensive. We want to ensure that we won't be the aggressor," he said.

Ukraine's Interior Ministry said it was ready to receive weapons as part of the initiative, but added that a "large number of our soldiers won't be able to hold back any of the Russian military forces." Last
