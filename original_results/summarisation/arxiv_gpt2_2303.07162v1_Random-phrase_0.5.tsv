Proposition

Proof

This is a theorem where

(theorem)

is the type of proposition which is to be taken to be true.

(i.e., to be true for any proposition of type T in a proposition-substitution is to be true for any proposition of type T in a proposition-substitution.)

(i.e., the type of proposition which is to be taken to be true for any proposition in a proposition-substitution is to be true for any proposition in a proposition-substitution.)

It is true for all propositions in a proposition-substitution to be true in the given proposition.

(i.e., all propositions in a proposition-substitution to be true in the given proposition.)

Proof

The following is a theorem where
