 been through and the things I have been through. "I would like to say thank you to all those who have brought you this great experience, I will be there again as a champion and a person as soon as possible." Darcey has already won Miss World but hopes it is a start to a process she has been waiting for in her life as she says she cannot wait any longer to win again. The winner of Miss World at the 2017 Miss World in June will take home £40,000 in cash for her efforts to win Miss World in July. Darcey is the only woman to win the Miss World in a single year in 2014 and will be competing for the Miss World in October at the same event.
