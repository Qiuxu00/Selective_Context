 the city was an opportunity to have "an impact". Darcey said she had been in the UK for five years and said she had visited several communities before racing and "a lot of people were like, 'well, you have to go to Miss World and you've got to go through Miss World.'" The 19-year-old hopes "you can now be free from the pain and the stress and have a positive life". Darcey's mother, Sarah Corria, has also called on fans to donate $15 to the charity to help Darcey's family. "If you want to support Darcey's family and be involved in their journey to Miss World, it's time," she said. Miss World has already put a donation of $100 towards the Darcey's medical treatment.
