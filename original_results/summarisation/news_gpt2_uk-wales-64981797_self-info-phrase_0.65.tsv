A beautiful, strong and beautiful woman who will be missed.

I'd like to say a few things about Miss Wales Darcey Corria:

I have been in her life for seven years and have never looked back.

She is not afraid to say she has been through the difficult moments of her life.

She will be missed.

She is happy to be able to look after her daughter on her own and to give her a home that she can enjoy.

I am very devastated.

For those of us who have been here for 13 years at the same time, the fact that she is now facing such a difficult and personal loss is an incredible loss.

I am a strong and motivated person.
