 resulted in a suspension of Mr Johnson from Commons. It said it was "very clear" the committee believed that the probe had failed to find Covid rule breaking, but not that it had been "sufficiently rigorous in its determination to find and punish". It said it would "review the evidence and make recommendations to the committee" Mr Johnson's defence was being "concealed" and that he did not have "a right to be heard" if the inquiry was not put on hold He said he had "a right to know" if the committee had been given an "unintended consequence". He said he had "no right to believe" the report had been "determined to be wrong". The committee has been forced to publish copies of its findings to allow it to move on to the next hearing. The findings will be published on Tuesday evening. The committee is also expected to make a report before the autumn general election on Wednesday. The inquiry was set up by the Liberal Democrats in May last year to probe the conduct of ministers who took part in key Cabinet meetings. A report by Mr Johnson's legal team found that many of them had been using improper or misleading information to get their political fortunes. It said it had found evidence that Mr Johnson had received "widespread and widespread" redactions in the course of his parliamentary career, including a letter he sent to a parliamentary aide asking for "a briefing or explanation of the Committee's findings". The inquiry said the information Mr Johnson had submitted to his committee was "the best that could be obtained". The inquiry said this was a major oversight.

"The Committee should be allowed to review the evidence and make recommendations to the committee to ensure there is no mistake in the conduct of ministers who took part in key Cabinet meetings, and that it is not possible to determine their motives or the motives of senior ministers who took part in Cabinet meetings," it said. "If that is the case, and the Committee is now able to review the evidence, it is not for the Commons to decide whether to suspend or to suspend it." Mr Johnson's legal team said he had been in regular contact with his legal team for the past two months, "without any interference or embarrassment". It said
