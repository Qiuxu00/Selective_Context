Russia's state news agency, RIA Novosti, said that the incident on Thursday is not a strike by militants, but a direct confrontation between Russian and Ukrainian military forces.

The Kremlin said a drone was shot down and that a crew member of the Ukrainian defence ministry was killed.

In a separate incident on Friday, the Russian air force said two Ukrainian drones flew near the town of Zaporizhko and that a crew member was wounded.

Ukraine's state news agency said the drone fired one missile at an artillery position, killing one of the two.

"A Russian-made attack on a Ukrainian air base in central Ukraine killed two Ukrainian personnel and a member of the Ukrainian military personnel, and three others were wounded," state media said.

Ukraine has been staging its own military exercise at the Crimean peninsula for two weeks until the end of March.
