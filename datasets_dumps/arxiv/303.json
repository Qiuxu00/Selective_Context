Our model includes Brownian motion with normal reflection. \nWe show that the phase transition between recurrence and transience occurs for asymptotically expanding domains. If the domain narrows asymptotically, we identify the phase transition between  null and positive recurrence.\nIn the recurrent case we characterise the asymptotic behaviour of the tails of the return times. Moreover, in the positive-recurrent case we prove the existence of the invariant distribution of the reflected diffusion and establish the polynomial rate of decay of its tail. Finally, we establish \nthe polynomial rate of convergence to stationarity by proving matching \nupper and lower bounds on the total variation distance\nbetween the marginal and the invariant distribution (see a short https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDDDWdbPx74YouTube video describing these results\u00a0<cit.>).\n\nAll the aforementioned  phenomena depend on the asymptotic behaviour of the boundary and are exhibited by a normally reflected Brownian motion. In particular, this implies that a normally reflected Brownian motion in an unbounded domain of any dimension (greater than\u00a01) may \nconverge in total variation to its invariant distribution, which has heavy tails.  \n\nBefore stating our results, we briefly describe  our setting. For any d\u2208, define a closed domain  := {(x,y) \u2208_+\u00d7^d: y_d \u2264 b(x)} in ^d+1, where \n\u00b7_d is the standard Euclidean norm on ^d,\n:=[0,\u221e) and\nb: _+ \u2192_+ is a smooth function with b(0)=0 and b> 0 on (0,\u221e).\nLet W = (W_t)_t \u2208 be a standard Brownian motion in ^d+1 and \u03a3 a matrix-valued function on , taking values in positive-definite square matrices  of dimension (d+1).\nDenote by \u03a3^1/2 the symmetric square root of \u03a3 and let \u03d5: \u2202\u2192^d+1 be a vector field  on \u2202.\nLet \nthe processes Z = (Z_t)_t \u2208 [0,) \nand L=(L_t)_t\u2208[0,)\nwith state spaces  and , \nrespectively, \nsatisfy\nthe stochastic differential equation\u00a0(SDE)\n\n    Z_t = z + \u222b_0^t \u03a3^1/2(Z_s)  W_s + \u222b_0^t \u03d5(Z_s)  L_s \n      &   L_t = \u222b_0^t 1{Z_s \u2208\u2202} L_s,    t \u2208 [0,),\n\nwhere \u2208 [0,\u221e] is a possibly finite explosion time\nand L denotes the local time process of Z at the boundary \u2202.\nFor any starting point Z_0=z\u2208, \nby\u00a0<cit.>, SDE\u00a0(<ref>) has a unique strong solution (with law denoted by _z)\nunder the assumptions in\u00a0ass:covariance1, ass:domain1 and\u00a0ass:vector1 stated in Section\u00a0<ref> below. \nInformally,\u00a0ass:covariance1 requires \u03a3 to be bounded, Lipschitz and uniformly elliptic, ass:domain1 \nrequires regularity of b at zero to make the domain  smooth,\nand ass:vector1 stipulates that the smooth bounded vector field \u03d5 points into the interior of .\nUnlike in the case of oblique reflection\u00a0<cit.>, asymptotically normal reflection\ndoes not exhibit explosions.

In this case, we study properties of the invariant distribution of Z on .\nRecall that, by\u00a0<cit.>, the process Z is strong Markov. An invariant distribution\n\u03c0 of Z is a probability measure on the Borel \u03c3-algebra \u212c() generated by  the open subsets of ,\nsatisfying  \u222b__z [f(Z_t)]\u03c0( z)=\u222b_ f(z)\u03c0( z) for all bounded measurable functions f:\u2192 and all t\u2208.\nA total variation distance between two probability measures \u03c6_1 and \u03c6_2, defined on \u212c, is given by \n\u03c6_1-\u03c6_2_TV=sup_B\u2208\u212c|\u03c6_1(B)-\u03c6_2(B)|.\nDefine  \n    M_c := -(1+\u03b2/\u03b2_c)/2,\n \nand note that, in the case \u03b2 < -\u03b2_c, we have M_c>0.\n\n\n\nSuppose\u00a0ass:domain2, ass:covariance2, ass:vector2 hold, \nZ solves SDE\u00a0(<ref>), and\n\u03b2 < -\u03b2_c.\nThen the reflected process Z possesses  a unique invariant distribution \u03c0. Moreover, for any \u03f5>0, the following statements hold:\n\n    \n  (a) there exist  constants c_\u03c0, C_\u03c0\u2208(0,\u221e)  such that \n\n    c_\u03c0  r^-2M_c-\u03f5\u2264\u03c0({z\u2208:z_d+1\u2265 r})\u2264 C_\u03c0 r^-2M_c+\u03f5,  for all r\u2208[1,\u221e);\n\n    \n  (b) for any starting point z\u2208 of Z,\nthere exist constants c_TV,C_TV\u2208(0,\u221e) \nsuch that\n\n    c_TV t^-M_c - \u03f5\u2264_z(Z_t\u2208\u00b7)-\u03c0_TV\u2264 C_TVt^-M_c + \u03f5,  for all  t\u2208[1,\u221e).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total variation distance between two probability measures P\u0303 and Q\u0303 on a \u03c3-algebra  of the state space \u03a9\u0303 is defined via\n\n    P\u0303-Q\u0303_TV := sup_A \u2208|P\u0303(A)-Q\u0303(A)|.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\u00a0<ref> shows that, surprisingly, a reflected Brownian motion Z in \u2282^d+1 with normal reflection \n(i.e., Z in the class of models with \u03c3_1^2=1, \u03c3_2^2=d, and \nc_0=s_0, so that \u03b2_c=1/d)\non an unbounded domain may be polynomially ergodic if the domain narrows sufficiently fast, i.e.\u00a0\u03b2<-1/d.\nIn this case the tail \n\u03c0({z\u2208:z_d+1>r}) \nof the invariant distribution \u03c0 decays asymptotically as r^1+d\u03b2 when r\u2192\u221e. Note that if \u03b2<-1/d,   the domain  has finite volume in ^d+1. However, by modifying either the covariance matrix or the reflection vector field so that \u03b2_c<1/d, for any \u03b2\u2208(-1/d,-\u03b2_c) we obtain polynomial stability of the reflected Brownian motion in a domain with infinite volume.  \n\n Theorem\u00a0<ref>(a)\ncharacterises the critical moment of the invariant distribution \u03c0 of the reflected process Z in a domain  with \u03b2<-\u03b2_c:\nfor any \u03b1 in [0,2M_c) (resp. (2M_c,\u221e)), the moment \u222b_z_d+1^\u03b1\u03c0( z)  is finite (resp. infinite).\nMoreover, by Remark\u00a0<ref> below, for every z\u2208 we have _z(Z_t\u2208\u2202)=0 for Lebesgue almost every t\u2208. By Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b), this implies \u03c0(\u2202)=0.\n\n\n\n\nThe polynomial rate of convergence in total variation of Z_t to stationarity, given in Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b), is half of the rate of decay of the tail of its stationary measure. Differently put, by Theorem\u00a0<ref>, we have\n\n    lim_t \u2192\u221elog_z(Z_t\u2208\u00b7)-\u03c0_TV/log t =1/2lim_r\u2192\u221elog\u03c0({z\u2208:z_d+1>r})/log r = -M_c.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Discussion of the main results\n\nThe fact that \u03d5 is an asymptotically normal reflection implies that, in the case with \u03b2 > 0, the process accumulates a positive drift in the horizontal direction when it reaches the boundary. Here, we observe phase transitions between recurrence and transience depending on the model parameters. When \u03b2 < 0, the process accumulates a negative drift in horizontal direction. In this case, the process is always recurrent, and in some cases the invariant distribution exists. \n\nWe now comment on the comment on the structure of the proofs and discuss features of the theorems in the previous section. A key step in the proofs of \nTheorems\u00a0<ref>,\u00a0<ref> and\u00a0<ref> consists of reducing the problem to certain super/submartingale\nconditions that can be verified. We stress that the processes involved (that turn out to be super/submartingales) in all non-critical cases, covering phenomena from transience to stability, are transformations of the reflected process in SDE\u00a0(<ref>) via a single parametric family of Lyapunov functions. The class of functions we use are not, and should not be, harmonic because the analysis of the return times and quantitative properties of the invariant distribution and rate of convergence require the presence of a sufficiently strong drift.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Positive recurrence\n\n\nTheorem\u00a0<ref> \nprovides detailed information on the ergodicity of the reflected process Z, with lower bounds matching the upper bounds.  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first  characterisation of the  rate convergence to stationarity in the context of reflecting diffusion, including the ones with drift. Upper bounds abound: for example\u00a0<cit.> provide upper bounds on the rate of convergence for various reflected diffusions with drift via drift conditions in\u00a0<cit.> (due to the presence of the drift, the upper bounds in this case are sub-exponential). \n\n\n\nIn contrast, the literature for lower bounds is scarce. \nOur approach to the lower bounds on the rate of convergence is purely probabilistic. It rests on \nnovel continuous super/submartingale methods, based on Lemma\u00a0<ref> below,\nwhich provide a general setting where the full force of the  idea behind\u00a0<cit.> (see Lemma\u00a0<ref> in Appendix\u00a0<ref> below)\ncan be exploited.  \nThe approach is robust to the underlying stochastic model and appears to be applicable to a general continuous ergodic Markov processes.   \n\n\n\n\nThe first step in the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>\nconsists of establishing the Feller continuity (Theorem\u00a0<ref> below) and \nirreducibility (Proposition\u00a0<ref> below) for the reflected process Z. The key technical challenge in this step consists of controlling the growth of the local time (cf. Section\u00a0<ref> below), which requires establishing Feller continuity of the stopped process first (see proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref> for details).\n\nOnce Feller continuity and irreducibility of Z have been established, the upper bounds in Theorem\u00a0<ref> are proved \nusing supermartingale conditions together with the classical convergence results in\u00a0<cit.>, applicable in the \nsubexponential case. This yields finiteness of moments of the invariant distribution \u03c0, which is then translated into upper bounds on the tails  in Theorem\u00a0<ref> via Markov's  inequality. \n\nThe lower bounds in Theorem\u00a0<ref> require a lower bound on the tail of the invariant distribution \u03c0. In contrast to the upper bounds, characterising infinite moments of \u03c0\nalone does not yield a lower bound on the tail of \u03c0. In order to circumvent this problem, we give a criterion for \u222b_ H \u03c0=\u221e for any  non-decreasing function H (not only polynomial). This criterion is obtained by Lemma\u00a0<ref>.\nOnce established, the criterion \nyields lower bounds on the tail of \u03c0 via elementary methods (see proof of Lemma\u00a0<ref> below). The lower bound on the rate of convergence in total variation in Theorem\u00a0<ref> follow from a supermartingale property of a transformed reflected diffusion in\u00a0(<ref>), the lower bounds on the tail of the stationary distribution \u03c0\nand a general result in\u00a0<cit.> (see Lemma\u00a0<ref> in Appendix\u00a0<ref> below) that converts the tails of the stationary distribution to a lower bound on the convergence rate in total variation. \n\nFinally we note that, in Theorem\u00a0<ref>, the critical case \u03b2=-\u03b2_c is omitted for brevity. Its analysis would require additional assumptions and a new Lyapunov function, analogous to the ones used in the proof of the critical case of Theorem\u00a0<ref>(c). We expect that, under appropriate assumptions, such analysis would yield ergodicity of the normally reflected Brownian motion with logarithmic decay in any dimension. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Return times\n\nIf the reflected process is transient, return times to compact sets are not finite almost surely (we will thus discuss Theorem\u00a0<ref>(a) in Section\u00a0<ref> below). In the recurrent case,\nthe upper bound on the tail of the return time in Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b) is established via a supermartingale condition of a transformation of the reflected process, which (via\u00a0<cit.>) implies the finiteness of the moments of return times. The upper bounds in the theorem then follow by Markov's inequality. \n\n\n\nThe lower bound in  Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b) is established via certain submartingale conditions and \nlower bounds on the tails of return times to bounded sets in Lemma\u00a0<ref>.\nAs in the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref> discussed above,\n Lemma\u00a0<ref> is again critical here (as the infinite moment criterion of\u00a0<cit.> cannot be applied to obtain the lower bounds on the tail). Note that \n Lemma\u00a0<ref> is applicable in the entire recurrent regime.\n This is key in the \n proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b), in contrast to the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>, where Lemma\u00a0<ref> is applied in the positive-recurrent case only. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n As our modelling assumptions ass:covariance2, ass:domain2, ass:vector2 are asymptotic (i.e., they only specify the limiting behaviour both of the coefficients of SDE\u00a0(<ref>), the domain  and the reflection vector field as x \u2192\u221e, see Section\u00a0<ref> below for details), it is natural for Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b) to assert the tail behaviour of return times for sufficiently large levels r only. However, with some further work,\nusing an argument based on uniform ellipticity and\nescape from the boundary, extending\nthe ideas of\u00a0<cit.> and Section\u00a0<ref> below\nfrom first moment to higher moments estimates, this requirement could be removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote also that, by Assumption\u00a0ass:domain2, the function b is sublinear as x \u2192\u221e, implying that there exist positive constants c < C, such that c x \u2264z_d+1\u2264 Cx for all z=(x,y)\u2208\u2229 (1,\u221e)\u00d7^d.\nTheorem\u00a0<ref> may thus be restated for return times of Z=(X,Y), given in terms of Z_d+1, instead of the scalar process X.\n\n\n\n \n\nRecall that for the modulus of the scalar Brownian motion, the critical exponent for return times equals 1/2, with moments of order less (resp. greater) than 1/2 being finite (resp. infinite).\nBy Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b), for domains with asymptotically increasing \n(resp. decreasing) boundary function b, i.e.\u00a0\u03b2 > 0 (resp. \u03b2<0), the critical exponent m_c for the return times of the reflected process satisfies 0<m_c<1/2 (resp. 1/2<m_c). Differently put, the reflected process in an asymptotically expanding (resp. narrowing) domain is, due to the asymptotically positive (resp. negative) projection of the reflection vector field in the x-direction,\n\u201cless\u201d (resp. \u201cmore\u201d) recurrent than the modulus of the scalar Brownian motion.\n\n\nIn the case \u03b2 = 0, the boundary function b may (but need not, see Lemma\u00a0<ref> below) be asymptotically constant, see the discussion in Remark\u00a0<ref> below. \n\n\nIn this case, the projection of the reflection vector field converges to zero sufficiently fast, so that the critical moment exponent of the return time equals m_c= 1/2,\nregardless of other model parameters. \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The recurrence/transience dichotomy\n\n\nTheorem\u00a0<ref>  characterises the recurrence/transience dichotomy for the reflected process defined by the SDE in\u00a0(<ref>) above. \nIts proof relies on a generalisation to continuous time, given in  Section\u00a0<ref> below, of the classical Foster\u2013Lyapunov criteria for transience and recurrence. We stress that our approach is purely probabilistic: our criteria are phrased in terms of continuous-time supermartingale conditions. In particular,  neither the Markov property nor any explicit knowledge of the infinitesimal characteristics of the process are required (cf.\u00a0discussion about the approach in\u00a0<cit.> in Section\u00a0<ref> below). Both of these features are crucial in the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\nThe critical asymptotic growth rate \n\u03b2_c is always positive (see Assumptions\u00a0ass:covariance2 and\u00a0ass:vector2). \nBy Theorem\u00a0<ref>, if \u03b2_c \u2265 1, then Z is recurrent \nfor all boundary functions b satisfying\u00a0ass:domain2. \nThis is for example the case for the two-dimensional Brownian motion \n(\u03c3_1^2=\u03c3_2^2=1 and d=1)\nwith normal reflection (c_0=s_0) in \u2282^2, as \nin this case we have \n\u03b2_c = 1.\nNote that, in any dimension d\u2208,\nthe critical growth rate \u03b2_c may be greater than one, implying recurrence for all boundary functions satisfying\u00a0ass:domain2.\n\nTheorem\u00a0<ref>(a) strengthens transience \nof Z, stated in Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b). Theorem\u00a0<ref>(a) shows\nthat for any r>0 and  z \u2208\u2229(r,\u221e)\u00d7^d,\nthe process Z does not visit the set \n\u2229[0,r]\u00d7^d\nwith positive probability (under _z), even though x-r>0 can be arbitrarily small (where z=(x,y)). The proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b)\nestablishes only that, with positive probability, the process Z does not return \nto \u2229[0,r]\u00d7^d\n after reaching the set\n \u2229(r_1,\u221e)\u00d7^d\nfor a sufficiently large r_1\u2208(r,\u221e).\nAs our assumptions are asymptotic, this extension requires proving, using basic analytical techniques, that,  with positive probability, the reflected process reaches an arbitrarily high level before visiting a neighbourhood of the origin.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 A heuristic\n\n\n\n\n  To give some intuition behind the main results, we describe a heuristic comparison with reflecting Brownian motion in an interval.\n\nWe try to estimate how much horizontal drift the process accumulates via reflections by heuristic renewal argument <cit.>. Suppose that the process is at the horizontal position x. Over the short time scale we can approximate the of the vertical coordinate by a reflecting diffusion Y_t/b(x) on the unit sphere \ud835\udd4a^d-1, where b(x) = r, for some r\u2208. This diffusion has zero drift and combined infinitesimal variance of \u03c3_2^2/b(x)^2 along with the vertical reflection of magnitude c_0/b(x). For r\u2208 define \u03c4_r = inf{t \u2265 0: Y_t_d = r}. Let y_r denote the starting point for the process Y satisfying y_r_d = r. Let _y_r denote the expectation with respect to the process Y started at Y_0 = y_r. Recall that b(x)=r. We apply It\u00f4\u2019s formula for diffusions with reflection to the process r^-2Y_t_d^2. Note that from the infinitesimal variance, it follows that the drift of the process is of magnitude r^-2\u03c3_2^2 and the boundary reflection is at -2r^-1c_0.\n\nIn the first case we start at y_r/2 and terminate at \u03c4_r, and in the second case we start at y_r and terminate at \u03c4_r/2. We obtain\n\n    1 = _y_r/2[r^-2Y_\u03c4_r^2] = 4^-1 + r^-2_y_r/2[\u222b_0^\u03c4_r\u03c3_2^2 t] = 4^-1 + r^-2\u03c3_2^2_y_r/2[\u03c4_r],\n\nand\n\n    4^-1 = r^-2_y_r[Y_\u03c4_r/2^2] = 1 + r^-2\u03c3_2^2_y_r[\u03c4_r/2] - 2r^-1 c_0 _y_r[L_\u03c4_r/2].\n\nClearly L_\u03c4_r = 0 _y_r/2-a.s.\nFrom the above equation we obtain\n\n    _z_r/2[L_\u03c4_r] + _z_r[L_\u03c4_r/2]/_z_r[\u03c4_r/2] + _z_r/2[\u03c4_r] = \u03c3_2^2/2rc_0.\n\nSince r = b(x), the expected local time accumulated by Y_t at { y _d= r}, over  the  complete cycle starting at y_r/2_d = r/2 and ending again at y_r/2_d = r/2, is equal to \u03c3_2^2/2c_0b(x). \n\n\nRecall that X denotes the x-component of the reflected process Z in\u00a0(<ref>).\nAn informative heuristic argument in <cit.>, based on the renewal theorem, \nestimates that the average local time \n\naccumulates as \n\n\nSuppose the process is at horizontal position\u00a0x.\nOver short time-scales, \nimagine we may approximate the behaviour of the vertical coordinate by a diffusion on the interval [-b(x),b(x)].\nThis diffusion has zero drift and infinitesimal variance about\u00a0\u03c3^2.\nThe (vertical) reflection is effectively of magnitude\u00a0c_0. After a transformation, this is\nequivalent to unit-magnitude reflection for Brownian motion on [-b(x)/c_0,b(x)/c_0] with variance \u03c3^2/c_0^2.\nBy an heuristic renewal argument similar to\u00a0<cit.>, this process should accrue boundary local time on average at rate about \u03c3^2/2c_0 b(x).\n\n\n\n    L_t\u2248\u03c3_2^2/(2c_0b(x)) t,    when  X_t is at level x.\n\nBy SDE\u00a0(<ref>) and the definition of \u03b2 in\u00a0(<ref>), the total instantaneous drift of X\n(when X_t=x)\nis thus approximately equal to\ns_0 \u03c3_2^2 b'(x)/(2c_0 b(x)) \u2248 s_0 \u03c3_2^2 \u03b2/(2c_0 x) for large x\u2208. \nConsequently, the large-scale behaviour of the horizontal coordinate X of Z is resembles that of the solution of the SDE\nX\u0303_t = s_0 \u03c3_2^2 \u03b2/(2c_0 X\u0303_t) t+\u03c3_1W\u0303_t\nfor large times t and values X\u0303_t,\nwhere  \u03b2\u2208(-\u221e,1) and W\u0303 is a one-dimensional Brownian motion. After time-changing the SDE for X\u0303 \nby t\u21a6 t\u03c3_1^2, we obtain  a Bessel-type process \n\nwhose drift coefficient is determined by\nthe ratio \u03b2/\u03b2_c. For \u03b2 > 0, we have a Bessel process of dimension \n2\u03b2/\u03b2_c and\n\n\nthe transition between recurrence and transience in the heuristic matches that of the result in Theorem\u00a0<ref>. In the case \u03b2<0,  the standard literature on Langevin diffusions\u00a0<cit.> implies that the invariant distribution exists if \u03b2< -\u03b2_c, the tail of invariant distribution decays at the rate x^\u03b2/\u03b2_c+1 (as x\u2192\u221e) and the convergence to the invariant distribution is polynomial with the critical exponent (1+\u03b2/\u03b2_c)/2. Again the heuristic coincides with our results in\u00a0Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\n\n \nThe definition of the asymptotically normal reflection requires the projection of the vector field \u03d5 in the x-direction to decay as s_0 b'(x)\u21920, when x\u2192\u221e. \nThe heuristic in\u00a0(<ref>) further motivates this definition: allowing a rate of decay \nof the projection of \u03d5 in the x-direction\ndifferent from that of\u00a0b'(x) \nwould miss phase transitions and other criticality phenomena.  \nMoreover, heuristic\u00a0(<ref>) and the definition of \u03b2 in\u00a0(<ref>) suggest that, in the super-linear case  \n \u03b2>1, the drift of X produced by the reflection at the boundary is asymptotically decays as x^-\u03b2 for large x \u2208.  Such a drift is too weak to influence the long-term behaviour of the reflected process, because the process does not interact with the boundary sufficiently often. \n\n\n\n\n\nFinally we note that the heuristic in\u00a0(<ref>)\nillustrates the difference between our domain , satisfying\u00a0ass:domain2,\nand the smooth domains studied in\u00a0<cit.>. \nRecall from\u00a0<cit.> that  the domain  with asymptotically narrowing boundary does not satisfy the assumptions of\u00a0<cit.>. This difference is more than just a technical caveat: one of the crucial features of the domains considered in\u00a0<cit.> is the availability of bounds, uniform in the starting point, of the increments of expected local time. In contrast, for a narrowing domain \n (i.e., b(x)\u2192 0 when x\u2192\u221e), by\u00a0(<ref>),\nan increment of local time over a short time period cannot be bounded uniformly in the starting point because its growth is proportional to 1/b(x).\n\nWe circumvent this issue via localisation, resulting in more involved proofs of fundamental properties such as the Feller continuity (see Theorem\u00a0<ref>).\nMoreover, in the case of asymptotically oblique reflection, \na narrowing domain  may result in an explosive reflected \nBrownian motion and explosive local time\u00a0<cit.>, suggesting further that local time in \ncan grow arbitrarily fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Related literature\n\n\n\nThe theory of reflecting diffusions began with\u00a0<cit.>.\nA large literature is dedicated to reflecting diffusions in bounded domains (see e.g.\u00a0<cit.>). In the unbounded case, the classical domains are cones  (see e.g. <cit.>). Reflecting diffusions have been extensively studied due to their vast applications, including queueing theory\u00a0<cit.> and mathematical finance\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nOur domain  in the case of (strictly)\nnormal reflection has been  studied in\u00a0<cit.>.\nTheorem\u00a0<ref>  can be viewed as a generalisation\nof a result in\u00a0<cit.>, which \nconsiders the case where \u03a3(z)\nequals the identity matrix and the reflection vector field is given by the unit normal on the entire boundary \u2202. In the context of our model, this setting is within the subclass \u03c3_1^2=1, \u03c3_2^2=d \nand c_0=s_0=1 (recall that these constants specify only the limiting values of \u03a3(z) and the reflection field \u03d5\non \u2202 as x\u2192\u221e).\n\nBy\u00a0<cit.>, the  (d+1)-dimensional Brownian motion with normal reflection has phase transitions between transience and recurrence at \u03b2_c = 1/d, cf.\u00a0(<ref>).\nIn particular, when dimension d is large, recurrence occurs only when the the boundary function grows at \nrate slower than 1/d, i.e., very slowly.\nIn addition, Theorem\u00a0<ref>(a) reveals that a (d+1)-dimensional reflected Brownian motion may be recurrent for a boundary function b with growth close to linear if \nthe projection of the reflection vector field \u03d5 in the x-direction decays as \n s_0 b'(x)\u21920, when x\u2192\u221e, for a sufficiently small constant s_0>0 (note that the projection in the x-direction of the normal reflection \ndecays precisely at the rate b'(x)\u21920).\nMoreover, Theorem\u00a0<ref>(a) and the formula in\u00a0(<ref>) imply that Z \nwith normal reflection (i.e.\u00a0s_0=c_0)\nmay be recurrent for the growth rate \u03b2 (of the boundary function b) arbitrarily close to one, if the instantaneous variance of Z in the x-direction is greater than the sum of the variances in all other directions. \n\n A general result in\u00a0<cit.>, for domains satisfying existence and uniqueness conditions of\u00a0<cit.>,  states\nthat a (d+1)-dimensional Brownian motion with normal reflection is positive recurrent if and only if  has finite volume. As in the case of Theorem\u00a0<ref> above,\n Theorem\u00a0<ref> and formula\u00a0(<ref>)  contrast with the result of\u00a0<cit.>. \n It is easy to see that the right choice of parameters results in \n positive (resp. null) recurrence in the domains with infinite (resp. finite) volume, e.g.\u00a0\u03b2<-1/(s_0d) (resp. \n -1/(s_0d)<\u03b2<1/(s_0d)) in the example in the previous paragraph.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in Section\u00a0<ref> above, some of the technical difficulties in our paper arise due to the fact that our domain \n with the function b decreasing to zero (e.g.\u00a0\u03b2 < 0)\nviolates the smoothness condition of domains in\u00a0<cit.>.\nA general framework, via submartingale problems, for a large family of domains that fail to satisfy the assumptions\u00a0<cit.> was developed in\u00a0<cit.>. Similar ideas were employed in\u00a0<cit.> to characterise stationary distribution for large family of reflecting diffusions with piecewise smooth boundaries.\nFinally we note that the invariant distribution and the rate of convergence of the reflecting Brownian motion with drift have been studied in\u00a0<cit.>, motivated by applications in particle systems (see Section\u00a0<ref> above  for a brief discussion of the relation between our result and those in\u00a0<cit.>).\nThe structure of the paper is given in the table of contents above.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MODELLING ASSUMPTIONS AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Modelling assumptions\n\nFor any  d \u2208 := {1,2,\u2026}, let \u00b7_d denote the Euclidean norm on ^d. \n\nDefine the closed domain \u2282\u00d7^d, where  [0,\u221e), by\n\n    := { z =(x,y)\u2208\u00d7^d:  y _d \u2264 b(x)},  where b: \u2192\n\nis\nstrictly positive and differentiable on (0,\u221e) with b(0)=0.\nLet \n\u2202={z\u2208:y_d =b(x)} be the boundary of  in ^d+1 and denote the unit sphere in ^d by \ud835\udd4a^d-1 := { u \u2208^d: u _d = 1}.

Interestingly, in the case \u03b2=0 the boundary function b  may exhibit a variety of different behaviours at infinity. For instance, b may grow to infinity (e.g.\u00a0b(x) \u2248log x), converge to 0 (e.g.\u00a0b(x) \u2248 1/log x), or be asymptotically constant.

Consider an (_t)-adapted  continuous process \u03ba = (\u03ba_t)_t \u2208, taking values in [0,\u221e].\n\nLet  denote the set of all [0,\u221e]-valued stopping times with respect to (_t)_t\u2208.\nFor any \u2113,r \u2208 and stopping time T \u2208, define the first entry times (after T) by\n\n    \u03bb_\u2113,T :=  T + inf{s \u2208: T < \u221e,\u00a0\u03ba_T+s\u2264\u2113}, \n    \u03c1_r,T :=  T + inf{s \u2208: T < \u221e, \u00a0\u03ba_T+s\u2265 r},\n\nwhere we adopt the convention inf\u2205 := +\u221e. If T = 0, we write \u03bb_\u2113 := \u03bb_\u2113,0 and \u03c1_r := \u03c1_r,0. Almost sure limits \u03c1_\u221e := lim_r \u2192\u221e\u03c1_r and \u03c1_\u221e,T = lim_r \u2192\u221e\u03c1_r,T exist by monotonicity. \nExplosion of the process \u03ba occurs\nif the event {\u03c1_\u221e < \u221e} has positive  probability. \nSince \u03c1_r,T = \u03c1_r on the event {T < \u03c1_r }, we have \u03c1_\u221e = \u03c1_\u221e,T on the event { T < \u03c1_\u221e}.  \nFor r_0\u2264 r,\nwe define the first exit time from the interval [r_0,r] after some stopping time T \u2208 by \n\n    S_r,T := \u03bb_r_0,T\u2227\u03c1_r,T.\n\nHere and throughout we denote x\u2227 y:=min{x,y} and \nx\u2228 y:=max{x,y}\nfor any x,y\u2208[0,\u221e].\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Non-explosion\n\nWe first establish criteria for \u03ba not to explode.\n\n\nThe main application of this result in the present paper is to prove that the reflected process with asymptotically normal reflection cannot explode. \n\nThis should be contrasted with the case of the asymptotically oblique reflection, where explosion may occur, see the characterisation in\u00a0<cit.>.\nThe non-explosion criteria in\u00a0<cit.> are more delicate than the ones in Lemma\u00a0<ref>, but require transience of the underlying semimartingale, making them inapplicable to the entire class of processes considered here. The following result is more robust (i.e.\u00a0with simpler assumptions), has an elementary proof and covers all the models analysed in this paper. \n\n\n\nLet \u03ba  = (\u03ba_t)_t \u2208 be an [0,\u221e]-valued (_t)-adapted continuous process \n\nand V: \u2192 (0,\u221e) a continuous function with lim_x \u2192\u221e V(x) = \u221e. Suppose there exist r_0,\u03b7\u2208, such that for all r \u2208 (r_0,\u221e) and any  T \u2208, such that [V(\u03ba_T)1{T<\u03c1_\u221e}]<\u221e, the process \u03b6^T,r = (\u03b6^T,r_t)_t \u2208,\ndefined by\n\n    \u03b6^T,r_t := (V(\u03ba_(t+T)\u2227 S_r,T)-\u03b7(t \u2227 (S_r,T-T)))1{T < \u03c1_\u221e},\n\nis an (_t+T)-supermartingale, i.e., for 0 \u2264 s \u2264 t < \u221e, \n\n    [\u03b6^T,r_t|_s + T] \u2264\u03b6^T,r_s ,\n\nThen (\u03c1_\u221e = \u221e) = 1.\n\nFurthermore, if for the (possibly random) starting value \u03ba_0, we assume [V(\u03ba_0)]<\u221e then [V(\u03ba_t)] < \u221e for all t\u2208.\n\n\n\n\nChoose r_1\u2208(r_0,\u221e) \nand define recursively the upcrossing and downcrossing times of the process \u03ba over the interval [r_0,r_1] as follows: \u03b8_1 := 0, and if \u03b8_k has been defined for some k\u2208, then \n\u03b8_k := \u03bb_r_0,\u03b8_k and  \u03b8_k+1 := \u03c1_r_1,\u03b8_k. Thus we have 0=\u03b8_1\u2264\u03b8_1\u2264\u22ef\u2264\u03b8_k \u2264\u03b8_k \u2264\u03b8_k+1\u2264\u22ef.\nMoreover, for any t \u2208, we denote \n    D(t,r_0,r_1) :=sup{ k \u2208;\u00a0\u03b8_k \u2264 t},\n \nthe number of downcrossings of the interval [r_0,r_1] up to time t for the process \u03ba. Since any continuous function on the compact interval [0,t] \ncrosses an interval of positive length at most finitely many times, we have D(t,r_0,r_1) < \u221e a.s.\n\nAssume  now (\u03c1_\u221e < \u221e) > 0. Then there exists t_0 \u2208 such that (\u03c1_\u221e < t_0) > 0.  We will prove by induction that {\u03b8_k<\u03c1_\u221e}\u2229{\u03c1_\u221e < t_0}={\u03c1_\u221e < t_0} a.s.\u00a0holds for all k \u2208.\nThe induction hypothesis holds for k=1 since\n\u03b8_1=0 < \u03c1_\u221e a.s.\nAssume the almost-sure equality of events holds for some k\u2208.\n\nSet T := \u03b8_k and note \nV(\u03ba_T)1{T<\u03c1_\u221e}= V(r_1)1{T<\u03c1_\u221e}, since the paths of \u03ba are continuous and, on the event {T<\u03c1_\u221e}, we have T<\u221e. In particular, V(\u03ba_T)1{T<\u03c1_\u221e} is bounded and hence integrable.\n\n\n\n\n\nPick any r \u2208 (r_1,\u221e) and consider \n the supermartingale \u03b6^T,r defined in\u00a0(<ref>).\n Note that (T\u2228 t_0)-T is a bounded (_T+t)-stopping time since,\n for any s\u2208, we have {T \u2228 t_0 -T \u2264 s} = {t_0 \u2228 T\u2264  T+s }\u2208_T+s as both t_0\u2228 T and s+T are (_t)-stopping times.\n Applying the optional sampling theorem to \u03b6^T,r\n at (T\u2228 t_0)-T yields:\n\n    (\u03c1_r,T<\u03bb_r_0,T\u2227 (T\u2228 t_0), T<\u03c1_\u221e|_T) V(r)- \u03b7 t_0    \u2264[\u03b6_(T\u2228 t_0)-T^T,r|_T] \n       \u2264\u03b6^T,r_0 = V(r_1)1{T<\u03c1_\u221e}.\n\nTaking expectations on both sides, we obtain the following inequality for every r\u2208(r_1,\u221e):\n\n    (\u03c1_r,T<\u03bb_r_0,T\u2227 (T\u2228 t_0), T<\u03c1_\u221e)\u2264  (V(r_1)+ \u03b7 t_0)/V(r).\n\nThus, by the monotone convergence theorem, we obtain\n\n    0\u2264(\u03c1_\u221e\u2264\u03bb_r_0,T\u2227 (T\u2228 t_0),T<\u03c1_\u221e )     =\n    lim_r\u2192\u221e(\u03c1_r,T<\u03bb_r_0,T\u2227 (T\u2228 t_0),T<\u03c1_\u221e ) \n       \u2264lim sup_r\u2192\u221e(V(r_1)+t_0\u03b7)/V(r)=0,\n\nimplying\n{T<\u03c1_\u221e}=\n{\u03c1_\u221e>\u03bb_r_0,T\u2227 (T\u2228 t_0)}\u2229{T<\u03c1_\u221e}\na.s.\nWe hence \nobtain \n\n    {\u03c1_\u221e < t_0}    ={T<\u03c1_\u221e}\u2229{\u03c1_\u221e<t_0}\n    =\n    {\u03c1_\u221e>\u03bb_r_0,T\u2227 (T\u2228 t_0)}\u2229{T<\u03c1_\u221e}\u2229{\u03c1_\u221e<t_0}\n        =\n    {\u03bb_r_0,T<\u03c1_\u221e}\u2229{\u03c1_\u221e<t_0} a.s.\n\nThe first equality in this display holds by the induction hypothesis, the second holds by\u00a0(<ref>),  and the third equality follows from the fact that T\u2264\u03bb_r_0,T by definition\u00a0(<ref>).\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the \n\nequality \n{\u03b8_k = \u03bb_r_0,T < \u03c1_\u221e}={\u03c1_r_1,\u03b8_k =\u03b8_k+1 < \u03c1_\u221e} holds almost surely,\n\nwe proved that {\u03b8_k+1<\u03c1_\u221e}\u2229{\u03c1_\u221e < t_0}={\u03c1_\u221e < t_0} almost surely,\nthus verifying the induction step.\n\nWe conclude that \n\n    {\u03b8_1<\u2026<\u03b8_k<\u03c1_\u221e<t_0}= \u22c2_i=1^k{\u03b8_i < \u03c1_\u221e < t_0} = {\u03c1_\u221e < t_0}  a.s.\u00a0for all k\u2208.\n  \nSince {\u03b8_i<\u03b8_i+1}={\u03b8_i<\u03b8_i<\u03b8_i+1} for every i\u2208 and\nD(t_0,r_0,r_1) < \u221e a.s., it follows that (\u03c1_\u221e < t_0) = 0, contradicting our assumption (\u03c1_\u221e<\u221e)>0.\n\n\n\nFor any t\u2208, by the assumptions in the lemma, for any r \u2208 (r_0,\u221e) and any stopping time T\u2208, satisfying [V(\u03ba_T)1{T<\u221e}] < \u221e, it holds that\n\n    [V(\u03ba_(t+T) \u2227\u03bb_r_0,T\u2227\u03c1_r,T)1{T<\u221e}|_T] \u2264\u03b7 t + V(\u03ba_T)1{T < \u221e}    a.s.\n\nMoreover, since the process \u03ba does not explode we have  lim_r\u2192\u221e\u03c1_r,T = \u221e a.s. \nThus,\nby Fatou's lemma for conditional expectations, which applies since the function  V is positive, and the inequality in\u00a0(<ref>), we get\n\n    [V(\u03ba_(t+T)\u2227\u03bb_r_0,T)1{T<\u221e}|_T]   =\n    [lim inf_r\u2192\u221eV(\u03ba_(t+T) \u2227\u03bb_r_0,T\u2227\u03c1_r,T)1{T<\u221e}|_T]\n       \u2264lim inf_r\u2192\u221e[V(\u03ba_(t+T) \u2227\u03bb_r_0,T\u2227\u03c1_r,T)1{T<\u221e}|_T] \n       \u2264\u03b7 t + V(\u03ba_T)1{T < \u221e}    a.s.\n\n\nTo prove that V(\u03ba) is an integrable process, we will again make use of the crossing times over the interval [r_0,r_1], denoted by \u03b8_k,\u03b8_k, for k-th downcrossing and upcrossing times respectively.

In the Markovian setting, there exists a rich theory providing upper bounds for additive functionals considered here, in the context of establishing related upper bounds on the tails of the invariant distribution (see\u00a0<cit.> and the references therein). Moreover, in the continuous semimartingale setting,\u00a0<cit.> establishes upper bounds on the return-time moments. Comparatively, the literature dedicated to lower bounds on the tails of the return times is scarce. Some results in this direction can be found in\u00a0<cit.>, however the assumptions are too restrictive to be used in our model. \nOur approach, based on the maximal inequality in Proposition\u00a0<ref> below, is inspired by the discrete-time results in\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\nThe link between between additive functionals studied in the present subsection and the invariant distributions in the Markovian setting, described in\u00a0<cit.>,\nenables the application of Lemma\u00a0<ref> below\nin the proofs of lower bounds on the tails of the invariant distribution and the sub-exponential convergence rate\nin total variation (stated in  Theorem\u00a0<ref>).\nLemma\u00a0<ref> is also crucial for \nestablishing the lower bounds on the tails of return times in Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\nLet \u03be = (\u03be_t)_t\u2208 be an -valued (_t)-adapted continuous process and f:^2 \u2192 a measurable function.

We start with the following claim.\n\nClaim. For any z=(x,y)\u2208 and r_0<x<r_1, we have _z(\u03f1_r_1<\u03c2_r_0)>0.\n\nProof of Claim.\nConsider the process started at z = (x,y) \u2208 and satisfying r_0<x<r_1. There are two possibilities. \n\n(I) z\u2208\u2216\u2202.\nFix  0<h'<h<\u221e.\nLet _h := {z\u201d\u2208: \u2203 z'\u2208\u2202 such that z\u201d-z'_d+1<h} and  _r_0,r_1,h := (\u2216_h) \u2229 [r_0,r_1]\u00d7^d, such that z\u2208_r_0,r_1,h, and \n\n    _r_0,r_1,h\u2282_r_0,r_1,h'\u2282_r_0,r_1,h',   _r_0,r_1,h\u201d\u2229{r_1}\u00d7^d  = _r_0,r_1,h'\u2229{r_1}\u00d7^d   for some h\u201d\u2208(h',h),\n\nwhere _r_0,r_1,h' is a closed domain with C^2 boundary.\nNote that the closed domain _r_0,r_1,h' can be obtained from _r_0,r_1,h' by smoothing its corners appropriately. \n\nA Dirichlet problem on _r_0,r_1,h' with boundary condition f: \u2202_r_0,r_1,h'\u2192 is given by \n\n    1/2\u0394_\u03a3u    = 0  on _r_0,r_1,h'\u2216\u2202_r_0,r_1,h'; \n    \n        u    = f,  on \u2202_r_0,r_1,h'.\n\n Choose a continuous function f: \u2202_r_0,r_1,h'\u2192, such that f \u2261 1 on _r_0,r_1,h\u2229{r_1}\u00d7^d = \u2202_r_0,r_1,h\u2229{r_1}\u00d7^d and f \u2261 0 on \u2202_r_0,r_1,h'\u2216 (_r_0,r_1,h'\u2229{r_1}\u00d7^d ). Then, by\u00a0<cit.>, the function\n\n    u(z) := _z[f(Z_\u03c4)],   where \u03c4:= inf{t\u2208:Z_t\u2208\u2202_r_0,r_1,h'},\n\nsolves the Dirichlet problem in (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>). Moreover, f(Z_\u03c4) \u22641{\u03f1_r_1 < \u03c2_r_0}, _z-a.s., implying u(z) \u2264_z(\u03f1_r_1 < \u03c2_r_0). Since f is continuous, _r_0,r_1,h' has a C^2 boundary and thus satisfies the inside the sphere property (see\u00a0<cit.> for definition), and coefficients in (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) are continuous and uniformly elliptic by assumption ass:covariance2, the maximum principle <cit.>, applied to -u, yields u(z) > 0.\n\n(II) z\u2208\u2202.\nDefine the stopping time v_h := inf{t>0:Z_t\u2208\u2216_h}. For the process started at z \u2208\u2202\u2229 (r_0,r_1)\u00d7^d, the continuity of paths implies _z[\u03c2_r_0]>0. Moreover, Assumptions\u00a0ass:domain2, ass:vector2 and\u00a0ass:covariance2 imply the conditions of\u00a0<cit.>, implying that \nfor some \u03b4_\u03a3>0 and all\nsufficiently small h > 0, we have _z[v_h \u2227\u03f1_r_1] \u2264 2h^2/\u03b4_\u03a3. Hence, there exists h\u2208(0, (\u03b4_\u03a3_z[\u03c2_r_0]/2)^1/2) such that _z[v_h \u2227\u03f1_r_1] < _z[\u03c2_r_0]. In particular, this implies  _z(v_h \u2227\u03f1_r_1 < \u03c2_r_0) > 0. If _z({v_h \u2227\u03f1_r_1 < \u03c2_r_0}\u2229{\u03f1_r_1 <v_h} ) > 0 the proof is complete. Otherwise,  {v_h \u2227\u03f1_r_1 < \u03c2_r_0}  = \n{v_h \u2227\u03f1_r_1 < \u03c2_r_0}\u2229{\u03f1_r_1 >v_h}=\n{v_h < \u03c2_r_0}, _z-a.s. Thus _z(v_h < \u03c2_r_0)=_z(v_h \u2227\u03f1_r_1 < \u03c2_r_0) > 0.\nBy the strong Markov property at v_h and step\u00a0(I) of the proof, the claim follows. \n\nProof of\u00a0(a): in this case we have \u03b2 > \u03b2_c. By Theorem\u00a0<ref> the process Z is transient.  \nThe Lyapunov function f_w,\u03b3(x,y) (with \u03b3<0) tends to zero  by\u00a0(<ref>) as x\u2192\u221e. Analogous to the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b), an application of Lemma\u00a0<ref> (and in particular\nthe bound in\u00a0(<ref>) with \u03ba=f_w,1(Z), V(u)=u^\u03b3),  implies that for every x_0\u2208, there exist c(x_0), such that for all z\u2208\u2229 [x_0+c(x_0),\u221e)\u00d7^d, we have _z(\u03c2_x_0 = \u221e) > 0. Moreover, the Claim implies that \nfor all z\u2208\u2229 (x_0,\u221e)\u00d7^d we have \n_z(\u03f1_x_0+c(x_0)<\u03c2_x_0)>0. \nThe strong Markov property at the stopping time \n\u03f1_x_0+c(x_0) concludes the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>(a).\n\nProof of (b): in this case we have \u03b2 < \u03b2_c. Recall the definition of m_c in\u00a0(<ref>). The upper bound holds by Proposition\u00a0<ref>. Moreover, Proposition\u00a0<ref> implies that, for any p\u2208(m_c,\u221e), there exist constants x_0\u2208(0,\u221e) and c_1,c_2\u2208(1,\u221e), such that for all x_1\u2208[x_0,\u221e) and z\u2208\u2229 (c_1(x_1+1)+c_2,\u221e)\u00d7^d we have _z(\u03c2_x_1 > t) \u2265 Ct^-p, for some constant C and all t \u2265 1, say. By the Claim, for any z\u2208\u2229 (x_1,c_1(x_1+1)+c_2)\u00d7^d we have _z(\u03f1_c_1(x_1+1)+c_2<\u03c2_x_1)>0. Hence the strong Markov property applied at the stopping time \u03f1_c_1(x_1+1)+c_2 implies  Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b).\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 FELLER CONTINUITY AND IRREDUCIBILITY OF THE REFLECTED PROCESS AND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe existence of the invariant distribution of Z requires positive recurrence (see definition preceding Theorem\u00a0<ref> above). The study of its moments requires certain technical results established in the present section. Section\u00a0<ref> is dedicated to the proofs of Feller continuity and irreducibility of the process Z. In Section\u00a0<ref> we apply these two properties to prove that the reflected process Z\nis Harris recurrent with an irreducible skeleton chain and that the set \u2229 [0,r]\u00d7^d is petite for any r \u2208(0,\u221e).\nMoreover, in Section\u00a0<ref> we will also show that every petite set for Z is bounded. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Feller continuity and irreducibility of the reflected process\n\n\nIn this section we prove\nthat the reflected process Z is Feller-continuous (see Theorem\u00a0<ref> below) and that \nthe (d+1)-dimensional Lebesgue measure \n_d+1\non \nthe Borel \u03c3-algebra () on \nis absolutely continuous with respect to \nits marginals of the reflected process at positive times (Proposition\u00a0<ref> below).\nWe start with the latter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u00a0ass:domain2, ass:covariance2, ass:vector2 hold. Then, for any z\u2208 and t\u2208(0,\u221e) and any A\u2208(), such that \n_d+1(A)>0, we have _z(Z_t \u2208 A)>0. \n\n\n\nThe proofs of Proposition\u00a0<ref> and Theorem\u00a0<ref> below require the following lemma.\nFor small h>0, define a \u201cthin\u201d neighborhood of \u2202 in  by _h := {z\u2208: \u2203 z'\u2208\u2202 such that z-z'_d+1<h}.\n\n\n\nLet\u00a0ass:domain1, ass:covariance1, ass:vector1 hold.\nThen there exists a functions G:\u2192, twice-differentiable on a neighbourhood of \u2282^d+1 \nand strictly positive on the open set \u2216\u2202. Moreover, the function g(z) := G(z)^2 satisfies \u2207 g(z) = 0  for all z\u2208\u2202 and for any r>0 there exist h_r>0, \u03b4 > 0,  such that the following hold\n\n\n  (a) \n\u03a3^1/2(z)\u2207 G(z)_d+1^2> \u03b4  for all z\u2208_h_r\u2229[0,r]\u00d7^d;\n\n  (b)\n\u27e8\u03d5(z),\u2207 G(z)\u27e9 >  \u03b4 for all z\u2208\u2202\u2229[0,r]\u00d7^d.\n\n\n\n\nRecall that Assumptions\u00a0ass:domain2, ass:covariance2, ass:vector2 imply Assumptions\u00a0ass:domain1, ass:covariance1, ass:vector1.\n\n\n\nExtend the function \nG:\u2192, defined by G(z):=b(x)^2-y_d^2\nfor any z=(x,y)\u2208, to a \nC^2-function on a neighbourhood of  in ^d+1.  Hence \n\u2207 G(z)_d+1^2=4(b(x)^2b'(x)^2+y_d^2)\nfor all z=(x,y)\u2208 and \u2207 g(z) = 2G(z)\u2207 G(z) = 0 for all z\u2208\u2202, since G(z) = 0 on\u00a0\u2202. \nRecall that\u00a0ass:domain1 yields lim inf_x\u21920b(x)b'(x)>0. Thus, for any r>0, there exists a sufficiently small h_r>0, such that 0<inf_z\u2208_h_r\u2229[0,r]\u00d7^d\u2207 G(z)_d+1^2=:\u03b4_h_r\n(we restrict to x\u2208[0,r] because of functions b with \u03b2\u2264 0, e.g. example in Lemma\u00a0<ref>).\nMoreover, by\u00a0ass:covariance1, there exists \u03b4_\u03a3>0\nsuch that \n\u03a3^1/2(z)\u2207 G(z)_d+1^2=\u27e8\u03a3(z)\u2207 G(z),\u2207 G(z)\u27e9\u2265\u03b4_\u03a3\u2207 G(z)_d+1^2\u2265\u03b4_\u03a3\u00b7\u03b4_h_r>0\nfor all z\u2208_h_r\u2229[0,r]\u00d7^d, implying\u00a0(a).\n\nNote that gradient \u2207 G(z) for any z\u2208\u2202 equals \nn(z)\u2207 G(z)_d+1, where n(z) is the inwards-pointing unit normal vector to \u2202 at z. Hence, by\u00a0ass:vector1, there exists a \u03b4_\u03d5>0 such that \u27e8\u03d5(z),\u2207 G(z)\u27e9\u2265\u03b4_h_r^1/2\u27e8\u03d5(z), n(z)\u27e9 > \u03b4_\u03d5\u00b7\u03b4_h_r^1/2>0 for all z\u2208\u2202\u2229 [0,r]\u00d7^d.\n\n\n\n\nWe start by proving that Z spends no time at the boundary. \n\nClaim 0.

Assume that Claim\u00a01 does not hold. More precisely, there exist t>0, z\u2208 and A_0 \u2208(), such that _d+1(A_0)>0 and \u222b_0^t _z(Z_v\u2208 A_0) v = 0.\n\n\n\n\nBy Claim\u00a03 there exist a ball B(z_0,h_0) in  and s\u2208(0,t) such that \n_d+1(A_0 \u2229 B(z_0,h_0)) > 0 and _z(Z_s \u2208 B(z_0,h_0)) > 0.\nClaim 2 (applied with z':=z_0, h:=h_0 and A:=A_0) yields the contradiction:\n0=\u222b_0^t_z(Z_v\u2208 A_0) v \u2265\u222b_s^t \u2227 (s+h_0^2)_z(Z_v\u2208 B(z_0,h_0)\u2229 A_0)  v>0.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo conclude the proof of the proposition, we strengthen Claim 1. \nSuppose there exist z\u2208, t>0 and A\u2208() with _d+1(A)>0, such that _z(Z_t\u2208 A)=0. Since there exists a ball B(z',h)\u2208(), such that _d+1(A \u2229 B(z',h)) > 0, \nby Claim\u00a01 applied to A \u2229 B(z',h) we have\n \u222b_0^h^2_z(Z_v \u2208 A \u2229 B(z',h)) v > 0\nfor all z\u2208.\nWe may assume h^2\u2208(0,t).\nSince  Z is Markov, we have\n\u222b_t-h^2^t _z(Z_s \u2208 A \u2229 B(z',h)) s > 0\nand hence _z(Z_s \u2208 A \u2229 B(z',h)) > 0\nfor some s\u2208(t-h^2,t). Thus t\u2208(s, s+h^2).\nBy\u00a0Claim 2\nwe get \n\n_z(Z_t\u2208 A) \u2265_z(Z_t \u2208 A \u2229 B(z',h))>0, completing the proof of the proposition.\n\n\n\n    \n    By Claim\u00a00 in the proof of Proposition\u00a0<ref>  above, for any z\u2208, the equality _z(Z_t\u2208\u2202)=0\n    holds for Lebesgue almost every t\u2208. \n    Note also that the proof of Claim\u00a00\n    uses only the occupation times formula for continuous semimartingales and basic properties of the solution of SDE\u00a0(<ref>). \n\n\nDomain , defined in\u00a0(<ref>), with increasing boundary (e.g. \u03b2>0, see\u00a0(<ref>) for definition) satisfies the conditions of\u00a0<cit.>, which establishes Feller continuity for reflecting processes Z. However, as explained in\u00a0<cit.>, \nthe assumptions of\u00a0<cit.> are not satisfied if the boundary function b decreases to zero (e.g. \u03b2<0). In the case \u03b2=0, the domain , may but need not, satisfy the assumptions of\u00a0<cit.>, see example in Lemma\u00a0<ref> below.\nSince the case \u03b2<0 is when positive recurrence occurs, we develop a new approach to Feller continuity of Z, relying on the localisation of the process. This is  more involved than the standard approach in the literature (see e.g.\u00a0<cit.>)\ndue to the difficulty of obtaining a global bound on the growth of the local time in the case \n\u03b2<0, which requires localisation.\n\n\n\nLet\u00a0ass:domain2, ass:covariance2, ass:vector2 hold.

This  lemma is key in the proof of the lower bound on the rate of convergence in total variation stated in Theorem\u00a0<ref>(b).\n\n\n\nLet \n _\u03ba be an an unbounded domain in ^m and\n\u03ba = (\u03ba_t)_t\u2208 a _\u03ba-valued Markov process with invariant distribution \u03c0_\u03ba. Assume the function G:_\u03ba\u2192 [1,\u221e) satisfies: \n\n\n  (a) there exists  f:[1,\u221e)\u2192(0,1], such that the function F:y\u21a6 yf(y) is increasing, lim_y\u2191\u221eF(y)=\u221e and  \u03c0_\u03ba({v\u2208_\u03ba:G(v)\u2265 y})\u2265 f(y) for all y\u2208[1,\u221e);\n\n  (b) there exists g:_\u03ba\u00d7\u2192[1,\u221e), such that for every u\u2208_\u03ba \nthe function t\u21a6 g(u,t) is continuous and increasing to infinity and \n\n_u[G(\u03ba_t)] \u2264 g(u,t) for all t\u2208.\n\nThen, for any starting point u\u2208_\u03ba\nwe have \n\n    \u03c0_\u03ba(\u00b7)-_u(\u03ba_t\u2208\u00b7)_TV\u22651/2f(F^-1(2g(u,t)))\n        for all t\u2208.\n\n\n\n\nA good choice for the function G in Lemma\u00a0<ref>\nhas the following properties:  the expectation   \n_u [G(\u03ba_t)]\nis bounded as a function of the starting point u and time t\nand \nthe function \ny\u21a6\u03c0_\u03ba(G^-1([y,\u221e)))\nsatisfies\nlim_y\u2192\u221e\u03c0_\u03ba(G^-1([y,\u221e)))=0\nand\nlim_y\u2192\u221ey\u03c0_\u03ba(G^-1([y,\u221e)))=\u221e.\nThe proof of Lemma\u00a0<ref>\nshows that if the assumption in\u00a0(a) holds for y\nsufficiently large, then the conclusion of the lemma is valid for all t sufficiently large. \n\n\n\nThe definition of the total variation distance (together with assumption\u00a0(a)) and the Markov inequality (together with assumption\u00a0(b)) imply  that for every\nu\u2208_\u03ba and \nt\u2208 the following inequalities hold for all y\u2208[1,\u221e):\n\n    \u03c0_\u03ba(\u00b7)-_u(\u03ba_t\u2208\u00b7)_TV\u2265\u03c0_\u03ba({v\u2208^d:G(v)\u2265 y})-_u(G(\u03ba_t)\u2265 y)\u2265 f(y) -g(u,t)/y.\n\nSince F(y)\u2192\u221e (as y\u2192\u221e) and t\u21a6 g(u,t) is increasing and continuous, for all y\u2208[F^-1(2g(u,0)),\u221e) (where F^-1 is the inverse of the increasing function F\ndefined in\u00a0(a)), there exists \na unique t\u2208\nsatisfying\nF(y)=2g(u,t)\u2208[1,\u221e). \nDifferently put, for every t\u2208, there exists\ny_t\u2208[F^-1(1),\u221e)\u2282 [1,\u221e)\nsatisfying y_t=F^-1(2g(u,t)).\nThus, for every t\u2208, we have \nf(y_t)-g(u,t)/y_t=f(F^-1(2g(u,t)))/2.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ASYMPTOTICALLY OSCILLATING DOMAIN\n\n\n\n\nLet b:\u2192 (0,\u221e) be a C^2 function with b(0)=0, satisfying\n\n    b(x) = loglog x(1 + (loglog x)^-2 + sinloglog x)    for  x > exp(+1).\n\nThen lim sup_x\u2192\u221eb(x) = \u221e and lim inf_x \u2192\u221eb(x) = 0. Moreover the function b satisfies assumption ass:domain2 with \u03b2=0, i.e.\u00a0lim_x\u2192\u221exb'(x)/b(x)=\u03b2=0, and lim_x\u2192\u221eb'(x)=lim_x\u2192\u221eb\u201d(x)=0\n\n\nTo show lim inf_x\u2192\u221eb(x) = 0, consider \u2113_k := exp(exp(-\u03c0/2 + 2k\u03c0)), for any k\u2208. It follows that \n\n    lim_k\u2192\u221eb(\u2113_k) = lim_k\u2192\u221e(loglog\u2113_k)^-1= lim_k\u2192\u221e(-\u03c0/2 + 2k\u03c0)^-1 = 0.\n\nSimilarly, to show lim sup_x\u2192\u221eb(x)=\u221e, consider \u2113\u0303_k := exp(exp(2k\u03c0)), for any k\u2208. We obtain\n\n    lim_k\u2192\u221eb(\u2113\u0303_k) = lim_k\u2192\u221e(\u2113\u0303_k + (loglog\u2113\u0303_k)^-1)= lim_k\u2192\u221e2k\u03c0 + (2k\u03c0)^-1 =\u221e.\n\nThe first two derivatives of b on x > exp(+1) take the form\n\n    b'(x)    = (xlog x)^-1(1-(loglog x)^-1 + sinloglog x + cosloglog x),\n    \n        b\u201d(x)    = (xlog x)^-2((1+log x)(1 -(loglog x)^-2 + sinloglog x+cosloglog x) + 2(loglog x)^-3),\n\nimplying that lim_x\u2192\u221e b'(x) =lim_x\u2192\u221e b\u201d(x) = 0. For the result about \u03b2 it is enough to show lim sup_x\u2192\u221e |xb'(x)|/b(x) \u2264 0. We estimate\n\n    lim sup_x\u2192\u221exb'(x)/b(x)   =  lim sup_x\u2192\u221e(log x)^-1|1-(loglog x)^-1 + sinloglog x + cosloglog x)/loglog x(1 + (loglog x)^-2 + sinloglog x)\n       \u2264lim sup_x\u2192\u221eloglog x(3 + (loglog x)^-1)/log x = 0,\n\nthis concludes the proof.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n\n\nMB is funded by the CDT in Mathematics and Statistics at The University of Warwick.\nAM is supported by EPSRC under grants EP/W006227/1 & EP/V009478/1 and by The Alan Turing\nInstitute under the EPSRC grant EP/X03870X/1.\nThe work of AW is supported by EPSRC grant EP/W00657X/1.\n\n\namsplain\n\n\n"}
