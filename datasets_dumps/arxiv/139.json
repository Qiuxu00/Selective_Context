Locally the geometry and complexity of the zero set of u is controlled in terms of its growth. In particular, one can bound the (n-1) dimensional Hausdorff measure of  the set {u=0}  in every Euclidean ball B in terms of growth of u around B. \n\n\n\n\nOne of the multiple ways to quantify the growth of a function is given by the notion of the doubling index. Given a positive number k and an Euclidean ball B=B(x,r) with center at x and radius r>0, we denote by kB the scaled ball B(x,kr). \nFor any function h in a ball 2B\u2282\u211d^n, the doubling index of h in B is defined by\n\n    \ud835\udca9_h(B):= log_2 sup_2B|h|/sup_B|h|.\n\nWe often write \ud835\udca9(x,r) instead of \ud835\udca9_h(B(x,r)) and often omit the dependence on h in the notation and simply write \n\ud835\udca9(B).\t \n\n  \n\tLet B\u2282\u211d^n be a unit ball. There exists a constant C=C(n)>1 such that \n\t\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 B)\u2264 C \ud835\udca9(B),\n\n\tfor all harmonic functions u: 2B \u2192\u211d.\n\nThe main result of this paper states that there is also a lower bound in terms of growth.\n\n\t\n\tLet B\u2282\u211d^n be a unit ball and n\u2265 3. For every \u03b5>0, there exists a constant c=c(n,\u03b5)>0 such that for every harmonic function  u: 4B \u2192\u211d with u(0)=0, we have \n\t\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 2B)\u2265 c \ud835\udca9(1/2B)^1-\u03b5.\n\n\n\nLet us make a few remarks. Given a unit ball B\u2282\u211d^n, Harnack's inequality for harmonic functions implies that if \ud835\udca9_u(1/2B) is sufficiently large,  then 2B must contain a zero point of u. If the harmonic function u is zero at the center of the ball B, then \n\n    \ud835\udca9(B)\u2265 c_n\n\nfor some numerical constant c_n > 0 (see Claim <ref> in Appendix <ref> for the proof). Hence, in Theorem <ref> there is a uniform lower bound, which was conjectured by Nadirashvili.\n\n\n\n\n\nNadirashvili's conjecture. If the harmonic function u is zero at the center of the unit ball B\u2282\u211d^3, then the area of the zero set of u in B is bounded from below by a positive numerical constant.\n\n\n\n\nNadirashvili's conjecture was recently proved in <cit.>. The fact sounds elementary, but there is no simple proof known, and there are applications including the lower bound in Yau's conjecture for nodal sets of Laplace eigenfunctions. We refer to <cit.>  for the statement of Yau's conjecture and related results.\n\n\n\n\nThis article does not pursue the purpose of generality. We restrict our attention only to the Euclidean case.   There isn't a methodological obstacle preventing to extend the main result to the case of smooth Riemannian manifolds, though we don't do this job. We hope that this decision makes the article more accessible for the reader.\n\n\n\n\nOne can compare this paper to the approach for Nadirashvili's conjecture in <cit.>, which gave a slowly growing bound\n\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 2B)\u2265exp (c log N/loglog N ),\n\nwhere N= \ud835\udca9(1/2B) is assumed to be bigger than 10 just to make the right hand side well-defined and u vanishes at the center of B. Compared to <cit.>, this article introduces the new notion of stable growth and a new multi-scale induction technique, which gives significantly improved lower bounds and allows to come closer to the following folklore conjecture.\n\n\t\n\tGiven a unit ball B\u2282\u211d^n, n\u2265 3, and a harmonic function u in 4B, which is zero at the center of B, the following lower bound holds:\n\t\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 2B) \u2265 c \ud835\udca9(1/2B),\n\n\tfor some numerical constant c=c(n)>0. \n\nBefore discussing the conjecture let us mention a few properties of the doubling index.\tThe doubling index is scale invariant. \nA non-trival fact states that the doubling index for a harmonic function u is almost monotone function of a set in the sense that \n    \ud835\udca9_u(b) \u2264 C \ud835\udca9_u(B)\n\nif a ball B contains the ball 2b. Here C>1 is a dimensional constant, but one can find a sharper statement in <ref> about the doubling index. The monotonicity property is a powerful tool often used in geometrical analysis. However,\nbesides almost monotonicity it is unclear how the doubling index behaves as a function of a set. Rescaling Conjecture <ref> and Theorem <ref>, one can\nsee that scaled doubling index \n\n    \ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9(B):=\ud835\udca9(B) (B)^n-1\n is comparable to the Hausdorff measure of the zero set of u in the following sense.\n\n\n\n\nRescaled Theorem <ref>.\n\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 B)\u2264 C \u00b7\ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9(B).\n\t\n\nRescaled Conjecture <ref>.\n\n    \ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9(1/2B)\u2264 C \u00b7\u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 2B) + C \u00b7(B)^n-1.\n\t\nThe extra additive term C \u00b7(B)^n-1 is required (u can be positive and have no zeroes in 4B), but as a rule it plays no role. \n\n\n\n\nA challenge in nodal geometry is to understand the distribution of the  doubling index as a function of a set. If Conjecture <ref> is true and the scaled doubling index for harmonic functions is comparable to the Hausdorff measure of the zero set, then one can conclude that the scaled doubling index is almost additive as a function of a set. The main Theorem <ref> is likely to have applications in nodal geometry as it gives a weak version of almost additivity for scaled doubling index with subpolynomial error term.\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper we introduce a new notion of stable growth. At some moment in this paper we will choose a dimensional constant C=C(n)>1 (its choice will be presented in Remark <ref>).  A harmonic function u:\u211d^n is said to have stable growth  in a ball B\u2286^n if \n\n    C^-1(12B) \u2264(2B) \u2264   C (12B).\n\nWe note that the first inequality holds due to almost monotonicity of the doubling index (see Lemma <ref> below) and can be omitted in the definition of stable growth. The assumption of stable growth is usually earned for free or for a small price of a subpolynomial error term, but it simplifies many of the proofs.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConjecture (<ref>) together with Theorem <ref> imply that if a harmonic function u has stable growth  in a unit ball B and A is a constant such that  \ud835\udca9(B) \u226b A>1, then on the scale 1/A the following property of the doubling index holds:\n\n    \u222b_B \ud835\udca9(x, A^-1)dx \u224d\ud835\udca9(B)/A.\n\nIn other words, it is anticipated that the average doubling index drops proportionally to the scale factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGMENT.\n\nThe authors are indebted to Mikhail Sodin for his enormous patience and numerous fruitful discussions that motivated this work.

Sometimes we will not need to explicate the center of the ball and we will simply write B(x,r)= B(r). We also write B to denote a closed ball.  Similarly, given a cube Q\u2282\u211d^n we write \u2113 Q for the cube which is the homothetic copy of Q with same center and with homothety coefficient \u2113>0. We define the maximal doubling index of a cube Q by \n\n    \ud835\udca9^*(Q) := sup_x \u2208 Q \n     0<\u03c1\u2264(Q) \ud835\udca9(B(x,\u03c1)).\n\nWe denote by c,c_1,c_2,\u2026 (small) positive constants and by C,C_1,C_2,\u2026 (large) positive constants,  which may change from line to line. Given two quantities A,B, we write A\u2272 B and A\u2273 B to designate the existence of two constants c,C>0 such that A\u2264 CB and A\u2265 cB, respectively. Here the constants c, C are allowed to depend on the dimension n. \nIf these constants depend on some auxiliary parameter \u03b3, we write A\u2272_\u03b3 B and A\u2273_\u03b3 B. If A\u2272 B and B\u2272 A, we write A\u224d B and A\u224d_\u03b3 B if one (or both) constants implied in the notation depend on the auxiliary parameter \u03b3.  Finally, we write A\u226a B to mean that, for a sufficiently small constant c>0, we have A\u2264 cB and A\u226b B if, for a sufficiently large constant C\u22651, we have   A\u2265 CB. Again, we write A\u226a_\u03b3 B and A\u226b_\u03b3 B if the constants implied in the notation depend on the parameter \u03b3. Sometimes we will just write \u224d, \u2272 and \u226a instead of \u224d_n, \u2272_n and \u226a_n. \n\n\n\nGiven some x\u2208\u211d, we write \u230a x\u230b for the largest integer smaller than x and \u2308 x \u2309 for the smallest integer larger than x.\n\nGiven a finite set F, we denote by # F the number of elements in F. For a set S \u2282^n and \u2113 >0, define the \u2113-neighbourhood of S by\n\n    S_+\u2113 := {x \u2208^n : x= s+b, where s\u2208 S and b\u2208 B(0,\u2113) }.\n\n  The zero sets of harmonic functions are often called nodal sets. We will sometimes refer to the Hausdorff measure of the nodal set as nodal volume. When we say that a harmonic function u has bounded doubling index in the ball B, we mean that there exists a numerical constant C>0 such that \n  \n    \ud835\udca9_u(B)\u2264 C.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 FIRST THOUGHTS AND OBSERVATIONS\n\n\nThis section discusses elementary ideas and some examples for building intuition about the zero sets and the doubling index of harmonic functions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Bounded doubling index \n \nThe following simple observation gives a lower bound for the nodal volume of a harmonic function in terms of its doubling index. We note that this bound is useful only when the doubling index is not large. \n\n\n\t \n\tLet B=B(0,1)\u2282\u211d^n be the unit ball and let u  be a harmonic function in  2B. Suppose that u(0)=0, then  there exists a constant c=c(n)>0 such that \n\t\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 2B )\u2265 c \ud835\udca9(B)^1-n.\n\n\n Before starting the proof, we formulate a consequence of Harnack's inequality. \n Let B=B(x,r) \u2282^n be any ball. Then  for any non-constant harmonic function u defined in 2B satisfying u(x) \u2265 0, we have\n\t\n    sup_43B u \u2273_nsup_B |u|.\n\n\n Let M and m denote the supremum and the infimum of u in B. If m\u2265 0, then the conclusion (<ref>) holds trivially. Let M' denote the supremum of u in 43B. It suffices to consider the case m <0, and show that -m \u2272_n M'. \n\t\n\t Let x_m, x_M \u2208\u2202 B be such that u(x_m) = m and u(x_M) = M. Consider the  positive harmonic function  h := M' -u  in 43B. By Harnack's inequality, there is a constant C=C(n) >1 such that \n\t\n    (M' - m)\t= h(x_m) \u2264 C h(x_M) = C(M' - M) \u2264 CM'.\n\n\tHence,\n\t\n    -m \u2272_n M',\n\t\n\tand the claim follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWe will estimate the Hausdorff measure of the zero set of u in  the spherical layer {4/3\u2264 |x|\u22645/3}. Let N:= 20\u2308\ud835\udca9(B)\u2309. Consider the behavior of u in the concentric spheres\n\t\n    S_i= \u2202 ( r_i B )= {x\u2208 2B : |x|=r_i}, where  r_i= 4/3 + i/3N\n\n\tfor i=0,\u2026,N and define\n\t\n    m_i^+ := max_S_iu,  \u00a0and\u00a0 m_i^- := min_S_iu.\n\nWe may assume that u is not identically zero.\tSince u(0)=0, the maximum principle  implies \n\t\n    m_i^+>0,   m_i^-<0,  m_i^+ <  m_i+1^+,  and  |m_i^-| < |m_i+1^-|.\n\n\tWe aim to show that there are two balls of radius c_0 N^-1 in B, for some c_0=c_0(n)>0, such that  u is positive in one ball and negative in the other ball. The following geometrical fact shows that existence of two such balls guarantees a lower bound for the nodal volume. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLet f:D be a continuous function in a convex set D\u2282\u211d^n.  Assume that  there are two balls B^+, B^-\u2282 D both of radius r>0 such that f>0 in B^+ and f<0 in B^-. Then\n\t\t\n    \u210b^n-1 ({f=0}) \u2273_n r^n-1.\n\n\t\n\n\t\t Consider line segments starting in B^+ and ending in B^-, which are parallel to the line connecting the centers of the balls B^+ and B^-. Since f is positive at one end and negative at the other end, every such line segment contains a zero of f. Consider the orthogonal projection of the zero set {f=0} onto a hyperplane orthogonal to these line segments. The zeros of f in the line segments project onto a (n-1) dimensional ball of radius r in this hyperplane. Since the orthogonal projection does not increase the distances, the  Hausdorff measure of {f=0} is at least the Hausdorff measure of its projection, which contains a (n-1) dimensional ball of radius r.  This completes the proof of Claim <ref>.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\tWe are ready to proceed with the proof of Lemma <ref>. \n\tWe will show that there are at least N/10 disjoint  spherical layers {x\u2208 2B: r_i-1\u2264 |x|\u2264 r_i} such that in each of them, we can find two balls of radius c_0 N^-1, for some c_0=c_0(n)>0, so that u is positive in one of the balls and negative in the other.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tThe increment of u from 43B to 53B can be written as a telescopic product\n\t\n    m_1^+/m_0^+\u00b7m_2^+/m_1^+\u22efm_N^+/m_N-1^+ = sup_5/3Bu/sup_4/3 Bu.\n\n\t By Claim <ref> and recalling that N= 20\u2308\ud835\udca9(B)\u2309, we have  \n\t\n    sup_5/3Bu/sup_4/3 Bu\u2272_n sup_2B|u|/sup_B|u| =  2^\ud835\udca9(B)\u2264 e^N.\n\n\t Similarly,\n\t\n    m_1^-/m_0^-\u00b7m_2^-/m_1^-\u22efm_N^-/m_N-1^-\u2272_n e^ N.\n\n\tHence we conclude that there exists C_1=C_1(n) >0 such that |m_i+1^-|\u2264 C_1 |m_i^-| holds for at least 3/4N values of i (and similarly for m_i^+). Thus, we have\n\t\n    m_i+1^+\u2264 C_1 m_i^+  and   |m_i+1^-|\u2264 C_1 |m_i^-|,\n\nfor at least N/2  values of i.\t\tFrom now on, we will consider only i satisfying (<ref>). \tLet x_i^+ and x_i^-\u2208 S_i be points where u attains its maximum and minimum respectively, i.e., u(x_i^+) = m_i^+ and u(x_i^-) = m_i^-.  Define \n\t\n    B_i^+ := B(x_i^+, 110N) and B_i^- := B(x_i^-, 110N).\n\n\tWe will now show that there is a small constant c_0>0 such that  u >0 in c_0 B_i^+, and u <0 in c_0 B_i^-, by estimating the gradient of u as follows:\n\t\n    sup_B_i^+ |\u2207 u| \u2272_n N sup_2B_i^+ |u| \u2272_n Nsup_83B_i^+u \u2264Nsup_S_i+1 u = N m_i+1^+\u2264_(<ref>) C_2 N  m_i^+,\n\n\twhere the first inequality follows from the standard gradient estimates (Claim <ref>), the second inequality follows from  Claim <ref>, and the third inequality follows from the inclusion 83B_i^+\u2282 r_i+1B.\n\tAll in all, we have  \n\t\n    u(x_i^+) = m_i^+ and sup_B_i^+|\u2207 u| \u2272_n Nm_i^+,  where \tB_i^+ := B(x_i^+, 110N).\n\n\tWe may conclude that there is a small constant c_0 \u2208 (0,1) such that u >0 in c_0 B_i^+. A similar argument implies that (for a small c_0\u2208 (0,1)) we have u <0 in c_0B_i^-. Finally, the Euclidean Claim <ref> implies the lower bound for the nodal volume. \n\n One can modify the argument in  Lemma 2.1 to prove a slightly better estimate for the nodal volume:\n\t\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 2B) \u2273(B)^2-n,\n\n\tby showing that \n\t\n    \u210b^n-1( {u=0}\u2229{x\u2208 2B: r_i-1\u2264 |x|\u2264 r_i+1})\u22731/N^n-1\n\n\tfor at least N/2 indices i. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe recall from <ref>  the known upper bound  and the conjectured lower bound for the nodal volume of a harmonic u vanishing at the center of a ball B \u2282^n\n\n    (12B)r^n-1Conj.<ref>\u2272_n\u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 B) Thm.<ref>\u2272_n(B) r^n-1.\n\nIn the case when u has bounded doubling index in B \n\n    \ud835\udca9(1/2B)\u224d\ud835\udca9(B)\u224d 1,\n\nTheorem <ref> and Lemma <ref> imply that the nodal volume of u is comparable to the surface area of B. \n\n \n\tLet B \u2282^n be a ball and let C>1 be some constant. Then for all harmonic functions u in 2B, vanishing at the center of B, such that _u(B) \u2264 C, we have\n\t\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 B) \u224d_C,n r^n-1.\n\n\tThe nodal volume is also comparable to the scaled doubling index:\n\t\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 B) \u224d_C,n\ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9(B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Chopping\n \n\nGiven a harmonic function u vanishing at the center of a ball B\u2282^n, how can we estimate the volume of the zero set  when the doubling index is large? \n\n\n\n\nWhen we start looking at the zero set at small scales, the doubling index in small balls around the zero drops down asymptotically in the following way:\n\n    lim_ 0(B(x,)) =  order of vanishing of u at x.\n\nThe latter limit is 1 for all x in the zero set except the singular set, that is the set where u and |\u2207 u| vanish simultaneously. The singular set does not contribute to the nodal volume as it has Hausdorff dimension (n-2), see <cit.>, and also <cit.> for a quantitative estimate. The non-singular zero set can be covered by countably many balls  with bounded doubling index. \n\n\n\n\nIn order to prove a lower bound for the nodal volume, a naive idea is to find small disjoint balls B_k = B(x_k,r_k) in B with doubling index (B_k) \u2264 C such that the harmonic function has a zero at the center of each B_k. Then in each of the B_k we have a lower bound for the nodal volume by Claim <ref>, and therefore\n\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 B) \u2265\u2211_B_k\u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 B_k) \u224d\u2211_B_k r_k^n-1.\n\nTo find balls with bounded doubling index, one can attempt to use the following idea of chopping. \nTake a cube Q (which is easier to chop than balls) and repeatedly divide it into smaller subcubes {Q_k}. At any point in this process if we have a subcube with bounded doubling index, we stop chopping, and if a subcube has large doubling index we continue chopping. Finally, in subcubes with small doubling index and a zero of u, one can use a version of Claim <ref> for cubes. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two problems to implement this idea. The first one is to show that for most of the subcubes the doubling index drops down. The second problem is to get some lower bound for the sum of scaled doubling indices \n\n    \u2211(Q_k) (diam Q_k)^n-1,\n\nwhere the sum is over subcubes Q_k containing a zero of u. We choose to work with (<ref>) as it imitates the nodal volume.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to obtain quantitative bounds for the nodal volume, one has to understand the distribution of the doubling index on many scales. More precisely, given a partition of cube Q \u2282^n into equal subcubes and a harmonic function in 2Q, what can we say about the doubling indices in these subcubes compared to the doubling indices of Q and 1/4Q?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next section we discuss two simple examples of the distribution of doubling index.  Old and new results about the distribution of doubling index of harmonic functions will be presented in <ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Examples\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWe consider the harmonic function u(x,y)= exp (Nx)sin (Ny), for some large positive integer N.  Partition Q=[0,1]^2 into A^2 many equal subcubes {Q_i}_i of side length A^-1. If 1 \u226a A \u226a N, then \n\t\n    \ud835\udca9^*(Q)\u224d N  and \ud835\udca9^*(Q_i)\u224dN/A.\n\n\tIn this case, the doubling index is a linearly decreasing function of the size of the subcubes. The zero set of u consists of parallel lines, see Figure <ref> below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\tConsider u(x,y)= ((x+iy)^N) for some large integer N>1. \n\tThe zero set of the function u is the union of 2N rays emanating from the origin, see Figure <ref> below. We consider Q=[-2,2]^2 and partition it into A^2 equal subcubes {Q_i}_i. \n\t\n\tWe have \ud835\udca9^*(Q)\u224d N. \n\tUnlike the previous example, the doubling index of the subcubes depend on the proximity of the subcube to the origin, which is a singular zero of u. Consider z\u2208 Q with |z| = r>0, let us now get an estimate for (z,1/A). In polar coordinates, u can be written as u(r,\u03b8) = r^N cos N\u03b8. Hence, for 1 \u226a A\u226a N, we have \n\t\n    logsup_B(z,2/A)|u|/sup_B(z,1/A)|u|\u224dlog(r+2A)^N/(r+1A)^N = log(1+2rA)^N/(1+1rA)^N.\n\n\tIf (1/rA) \u226a 1, or equivalently r\u226b 1/A, then we have\n\t\n    (z,1/A) \u224dN/rA.\n\n\tThus, for subcubes Q_i close to the origin, we have ^*(Q_i) \u224d N. And for subcubes away from the origin, e.g. the ones in B(0,1)\\ B(0,1/2), we have ^*(Q_i) \u224d N/A. \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a7 DOUBLING INDEX AND THE FREQUENCY FUNCTION \n\n\nThe frequency of a harmonic function is a well-studied close cousin of the doubling index. Due to its analytic nature, it is sometimes easier to study the frequency than the doubling index. In this section, we first define the frequency of a harmonic function and then present some of its well-known properties. Later, we discuss the relation between the frequency and the doubling index. All the results presented in this section are well-known; for completeness, we give their proofs in Appendix <ref>. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Frequency of a harmonic function\n\n\n\nGiven  a harmonic function u in \u211d^n, x\u2208\u211d^n  and r>0,  we define \n\n    H(x,r):= \u222b_\u2202 B(x,r) u^2 dS,\n\nwhere dS is the surface measure on \u2202 B(x,r). Moreover, we also let \n \n    G(x,r):= \u222b_B(x,r) |\u2207 u|^2 d.\n\nThe frequency function is defined by \n\n    \u03b2(x,r):= r G(x,r)/H(x,r).\n \n Agmon <cit.> and  Almgren <cit.> proved that \u03b2(\u00b7) is a monotonic function. \n\n\n\t\n\tFor any harmonic function in \u211d^n, its frequency function \u03b2(r):=\u03b2(0,r) is a non-decreasing function of r. \n\n\nGarofalo and Lin  <cit.> generalized it to elliptic operators with variable coefficients, see also the work of Kukavica <cit.> and Mangoubi <cit.>. We would like to mention an elegant work of Colding and Minicozzi <cit.>, which proves monotonicity of the frequency function for parabolic operators in a suprisingly elementary way and in great generality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equivalent way to define the frequency function is \n\n    \u03b2(x,r):= rH'(x,r)/2H(x,r) - n-1/2,\n\nwhere the derivative is taken with respect to r, see Appendix <ref>. That is the frequency is the logarithmic derivative of H, up to the factor of r and constants. The following is an immediate corollary of this definition and the monotonicity of \u03b2.\n \n \n\tFor any harmonic function in \u211d^n, let \u03b2(r)= \u03b2(0,r) be its frequency function. For any 0<r_1<r_2,  we have \n \n    H(r_2)/r_2^n-1= H(r_1)/r_1^n-1exp( 2 \u222b_r_1^r_2\u03b2(r)/rdr).\n\n Moreover, we also have \n \n    (r_2/r_1)^2\u03b2(r_1) + n-1\u2264H(r_2)/H(r_1)\u2264(r_2/r_1)^2\u03b2(r_2) + n-1.\n\n \n\n\n \n\tTo define the frequency, it is not necessary for the harmonic function to be defined in the whole of ^n. For any R>1 and any harmonic function defined in a neighbourhood of the closed ball B(x,R)\u2282^n, the frequency is well defined by (<ref>) for r\u2208 [0,R]. All the results about the frequency (namely Theorem <ref>, Corollary <ref>, and Lemmas <ref> & <ref>) hold in any ball where the harmonic function is defined. \n\n\n \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Relation between the frequency and the doubling index\n Thanks to the standard elliptic estimates (see the proofs in Appendix <ref>), we have the following comparison between the frequency in a ball and the doubling index in a slightly larger ball. \n \n  \n\n\t  Let \u03b4>0 be a sufficiently small parameter and let \ud835\udca9(r):= \ud835\udca9(B(0,r)), for r>0. There exists a constant C=C(\u03b4,n)\u2265 1 such that \n\t\n    \u03b2 (r(1+\u03b4))(1-100\u03b4) -C\u2264\ud835\udca9(r) \u2264\u03b2 (2r(1+\u03b4))(1+100\u03b4) +C\n\nuniformly\tfor all 0<r\u2264 4^-1 \tand all harmonic functions u defined in B(0,2). \n\nThe above lemma together with the monotonicity of the frequency (Theorem <ref>) immediately imply the following almost monotonicity property of the doubling index.  \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLet \u03b4>0 be a sufficiently small parameter and let u be a harmonic function in B(0,2). Let \ud835\udca9(r):= \ud835\udca9(B(0,r)), for r>0. There exists a constant C=C(\u03b4,n)>0, independent of u, such that \n\t\n    (r_2/r_1)^\ud835\udca9(r_1)(1-\u03b4)-C\u2264sup_B(0,r_2)|u|/sup_B(0,r_1)|u|\u2264(r_2/r_1)^\ud835\udca9(r_2)(1+\u03b4)+C,\n\n\t for all r_1\u2264 r_2/2\u2264 4^-1. In particular, we have \n\t\n    \ud835\udca9(r_1)(1-\u03b4) - C\u2264\ud835\udca9(r_2)(1+\u03b4) + C.\n\n\n\n\n \nLet B\u2282\u211d^n be any ball and let u be a harmonic function in 2B. There exists some constant C=C(n)>1 such that \n\n    \ud835\udca9_u(b) \u2264 C \ud835\udca9_u(B)\n\nfor all balls b with  2b\u2282 B.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISTRIBUTION OF THE DOUBLING INDEX AND HOW TO USE IT\n\nIn this section we review the known results from <cit.>, <cit.> about the distribution of the doubling index and formulate a new bound (Proposition <ref>) , which is a crucial ingredient of the paper for proving a lower bound for the nodal volume. \n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Upper bounds for the distribution of doubling index\n\n\n\nThe following result is borrowed from <cit.>. A sketch of the proof is provided in Appendix <ref>. The proposition below states that if we chop a big cube into smaller subcubes, then most of the subcubes have smaller doubling index than that of the big cube.\n\n\n\t\n\tLet a cube Q in \u211d^n be partitioned into A^n equal subcubes Q_i. Let u be a harmonic function in 4\u221a(n)\u00b7 Q. There exist numerical (depending only on the dimension n) constants A_0,C > 1 and c>0  such that  if A>A_0, then the number of Q_i with \n\t\n    ^*(Q_i)>max(^*(Q)exp(- c log A/ loglog A ), C)\n\n\tis smaller than A^n-1-c. \n\n\n\n\nThe work of Donnelly\u2013Fefferman <cit.> gives a different kind of information about the distribution of the doubling index.\n\n\n\t Let Q be a unit cube in ^n and let u be a harmonic function in 4\u221a(n)\u00b7 Q. Let \u03b5>0 and \tlet  Q  be partitioned into  equal subcubes {Q_i}_i of side length  \u224d_nc_u^*(Q) for some sufficiently small c=c(n,\u03b5)>0.  There exists a constant C = C(n,\u03b5) > 1 such that \n\t\n    ^*(Q_i)\u2264 C\n\n\tfor at least (1-\u03b5) portion of the Q_i. \n\nAlthough Proposition <ref> is known to experts and is attributed to Donnelly and Fefferman, we could not find a precise reference. A version of it appeared in the study of the doubling index for Laplace eigenfunctions <cit.>. Roughly speaking, if we consider a Laplace eigenfunction on a compact Riemannian manifold with eigenvalue \u03bb, and cover the manifold with balls of radius \u224d\u03bb^-1/2, the doubling index for most of these balls is bounded. \n\n\n\n\nWe will not use Proposition <ref>  by Donnelly and Fefferman in \nour present work. Nevertheless,  it follows in a straightforward way from their results in <cit.> about holomorphic functions and the method of holomorphic extension. A formal deduction of Proposition <ref> is contained in Appendix <ref>. The result is formulated here for the sake of completeness and in connection to Conjecture <ref> (almost additivity). \nTo explain the connection we have to formulate another conjecture.\n\n\n\t\n\tAssume that a harmonic function u has stable growth in a unit ball B and \ud835\udca9_u(B)=N \u226b 1.\n\tLet us cover 2B by a lattice of cubes Q_i of size 1/N. Then the number of Q_i in 2B, which contain a zero of u, is at least \n\tcN^n for some c>0 depending on the dimension n.\n  \n\nLet us make a few remarks and speculations. \n\nThe constant c in Conjecture <ref> might become worse as we change the constant in the definition of stable growth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConjecture <ref> about many separated zeroes and Proposition <ref> imply that Conjecture <ref> is true under the assumption of stable growth. \nRoughly speaking they imply that one can find \u224d N^n cubes Q_i of size 1/N  (N=\ud835\udca9_u(B)), which contain zeroes of u and have a bounded doubling index. Claim <ref> implies that 2Q_i must have nodal volume \u2273 1/N^n-1. So \n\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 2B) \u2273 N\n\nin the case of stable growth (this additional assumption can be earned for free).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7  New result on the distribution of doubling index\n \n\nLet us remind the definition of scaled doubling index.\n\n  For a harmonic function u in a ball 2B \u2282^n, we define the scaled doubling index (s.d.i.) of B, denoted by \ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9(B), to be \n\t\n    \ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9(B) := (B) r^n-1,\n \n\twhere r is the radius of B.\n\n\nFor a harmonic function vanishing at the center of a ball B,  \ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9( B) is conjectured (Conjecture <ref>) to give a lower bound for its nodal volume in 2B. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplementary to the known results (<ref>), our main new result also gives a lower bound for the distribution of the doubling index.  Given a ball B and a harmonic function on 4B, we show that there is a  collection of disjoint balls with doubling index smaller than (2B), but whose total s.d.i. is almost as large as ( B).\n\n\t\n\tLet B\u2282\u211d^n be a unit ball, u: 4B a harmonic function, and A>1  a sufficiently large parameter. Let N_1:= (1/2B) and N_2:= \ud835\udca9(2B). Then there \n\texists a constant C_A>1 such that whenever N_1\u2265 C_A,  there exists a collection of disjoint balls {B_i = B(x_i,r_i)}_i \u2208\u2110 such that \n\t\n\t\t\n  * We have an upper bound on the doubling index:\n\t\t\n    max(2B_i) \u2272_n N_2/A.\n \n\t\t\n  *  We have a lower bound on the sum of the s.d.i.'s:\n\t\t\n    \u2211\ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9(12B_i)=\u2211(12B_i) r_i^n-1\u2273_n N_1/(log Aloglog A)^n-1.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n  * Vanishing and non-intersection properties:\n\t\t\n    u(x_i) = 0, 4B_i \u2229 4 B_j=\u2205, and 4B_i\u2282 2B,\n\n\t\tfor all i\u2260 j. \n\t\n\n\n\n\nWe now briefly sketch how one can use Proposition <ref> to implement the naive idea discussed in <ref>  in order to prove a lower bound for the zero set. \nOne can recursively apply Proposition <ref> in order to obtain a collection of balls with bounded doubling indices. Roughly speaking, in each step we apply Proposition <ref> to each of the balls with large doubling index and replace it by a collection of sub-balls with smaller doubling index. Conditions (<ref>) and (<ref>) guarantee that in a finite number of steps all balls will have bounded doubling index  and  u must vanish at the center of each ball. The number of steps can be estimated in terms of N_2 and A.\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition (<ref>) should be interpreted as a condition ensuring that after recursive applications of Proposition <ref>, we don't lose too much of the nodal set. Here is an informal explanation. The sum  \u2211\ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9( B_i) imitates the nodal volume. If we believe in Conjecture <ref>, then \n\n    \u2211\u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 2B_i) \u2273\u2211\ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9( B_i) \u2273N_1/(log Aloglog A)^n-1,\n\nand the loss of the nodal volume in each step is subpolynomial in A. \n\nIn the last step all balls have bounded doubling index. Recall that if u has a bounded doubling index in a ball B and vanishes at its  center, then Claim <ref> gives the following estimate for the nodal volume \n\n    \ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9( B) \u224d\u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 B) \u224d (radius(B))^n-1.\n\nWe can apply Claim <ref> to each of the balls in the last step and the control (<ref>) of the sum of s.d.i. provides a lower bound for the nodal volume. In the next section we formalize the idea and quantify what kind of a lower bound we get for the  nodal volume.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 How to use Proposition <ref>\n We will start proving \n\tProposition <ref> only in <ref>. Now, we show how Proposition <ref> implies the following lower bound for the nodal volume. \n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tLet B\u2282\u211d^n be a unit ball, and u: 4B a harmonic function. Assume that \u03b5>0,  N_1  := \ud835\udca9(1/2B) \u226b_n,\u03b5 1, and N_2 := \ud835\udca9(2B). Then we have  \n\t\t\n    \u210b^n-1( {u=0}\u2229 2B)\u2273_n,\u03b5  N_1^1-\u03b5(N_1/N_2)^\u03b5.\n \n\t\n\tWe observe that if u has stable growth in a unit ball B, i.e. the ratio N_2/N_1 is bounded by some numerical constant (possibly depending on the dimension n), then Lemma <ref> immediately implies Theorem <ref> under the assumption of stable growth. Unfortunately, the bound in Lemma <ref> gets worse as the ratio N_2/N_1 gets larger. However, in <ref> we will show that Lemma <ref> implies Theorem <ref> by reducing the general case to the stable growth case.\n\t\n\t Given \u03b5>0, we will choose a large constant A=A(\u03b5)\u2265 2 later.  Let C_A\u2265 1 be given by Proposition <ref>, and assume that C_A\u226b_n 1. Starting with S_0 := {B}, for every k \u2208, we will recursively use Proposition <ref> to construct a collection of balls S_k = {B_\u03b1}. This sequence will eventually stabilize, that is, there exists K\u2265 0 such that S_k = S_K for every k \u2265 K. Moreover, the final collection S_K will be such that  for every ball B_\u03b1\u2208 S_K,  u vanishes at its center and (12B_\u03b1) \u2264 C_A.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tLet S_0 := {B}. Given S_k = {B_\u03b1}, we will define S_k+1. Suppose B_\u03b1\u2208 S_k is such that (1/2 B_\u03b1) \u2264 C_A, then we retain B_\u03b1 in S_k+1. If (1/2 B_\u03b1) > C_A, then we apply Proposition <ref> to B_\u03b1 to obtain a collection of balls {B_\u03b1,i}_i satisfying the three conditions of  Proposition <ref>, and this collection will replace B_\u03b1 in S_k+1, i.e.,\n\t\t\n    S_k+1 := {B_\u03b1: B_\u03b1\u2208 S_k and (12 B_\u03b1) \u2264 C_A}\u222a{B_\u03b1,i: B_\u03b1\u2208 S_k and (12 B_\u03b1) > C_A}.\n\n\t\t\n\t\tFor B_\u03b1\u2208 S_k, let x_\u03b1 and r_\u03b1 be its center and radius respectively.  We claim that the collection S_k satisfies the following properties:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  *  For some (large) C=C(n)\u2265 1, we have for every B_\u03b1\u2208 S_k: \n\t\t\t\n    (2B_\u03b1) \u2264  C^k N_2/A^k  or (12 B_\u03b1) \u2264 C_A.\n\n\t\t\t\n  *  For some (small) c=c(n)>0, we have \n\t\t\t\n    \u2211_B_\u03b1\u2208 S_k(12B_\u03b1) r_\u03b1^n-1\u2265 c^k N_1/(log Aloglog A)^k(n-1).\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  * Vanishing  and non-intersection properties: \n\t\t\t\n    u(x_\u03b1) = 0 , 4B_\u03b1\u2229 4B_\u03b3=\u2205,  and 4B_\u03b1\u2282 2B,\n\n\t\t\tfor all B_\u03b1,B_\u03b3\u2208 S_k with B_\u03b1\u2260 B_\u03b3.\n\t\t\n\t\tWe prove by induction that the above properties <ref>-<ref> hold for every S_k. Properties <ref>-<ref> hold for S_1 by the statement of Proposition <ref>. Assuming that all the above properties hold for S_k, let us show that they hold for S_k+1 as well. It is an immediate consequence of Proposition <ref> and the way S_k is constructed that <ref> and <ref> hold. We now show that <ref> also holds. We partition S_k into S_k^(1) and S_k^(2) where\n\t\t\n    S_k^(1) = {B_\u03b1\u2208 S_k: (12 B_\u03b1) \u2264 C_A} and S_k^(2) = S_k \u2216 S_k^(1).\n\n\t\tFor B_\u03b1\u2208 S_k^(2), we denote by {B_\u03b1,i}_i the collection of balls obtained by applying Proposition <ref> to B_\u03b1.

We  now indicate where to find these results, and also what we do in the remaining sections. \nWe advise the reader to keep Figure <ref> and the following as a guide while navigating through the rest of the paper. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ref> Distribution of the doubling index and how to use it: In this section, we present old and new results on the distribution of the doubling index of a harmonic function. Given a cube Q \u2282^n which is partitioned into equal subcubes Q_i, Proposition <ref>, which was established in <cit.>, gives an upper bound on the number of cubes with large doubling index.\n\n\n \n\nProposition <ref> is a new result about the distribution of doubling index. For a harmonic function u defined in a ball B, Proposition <ref> gives a collection of disjoint balls in B satisfying the following properties: u vanishes at their centers, their total s.d.i. is large, and their doubling index is much smaller than (B). We explain how to use Proposition <ref> in Lemma <ref>, which gives a lower bound for the nodal volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ref> Stable growth: \nIn this section, we study the  behaviour of a harmonic function in a ball with stable growth (Definition <ref>). In <ref>, we prove Lemma <ref>,\nwhich gives estimates for the growth of a harmonic function in a spherical layer where the frequency is almost constant. \n\n\n\n\nIn some instances, we will prove  results about the nodal set of a harmonic function in a ball B, under the simplified assumption of stable growth. Claim <ref>, proved in <ref>, serves as a bridge between the stable growth case and the general case by implying that for any harmonic function defined in ball B, there are several balls B_k \u2282 B of significant size with stable growth.  Lemma <ref> implies Theorem <ref> under the additional assumption of stable growth. We show that this along with Claim <ref> implies the general case of Theorem <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n<ref> Reducing Proposition <ref> to the stable growth case: We state Lemma <ref>, which is a  version of Proposition <ref> with the additional  assumption of stable growth. Using Claim  <ref> again, we reduce Proposition <ref> to Lemma <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n<ref> Zeros of harmonic functions in a tunnel: In this section, we study harmonic functions defined in a tunnel, that is a hyper-rectangle in ^n with all sides but one of equal length, while the length of the remaining side is much larger than the others. In Lemma <ref>, we show that for a harmonic function u defined in a good tunnel (which is a tunnel where u has significant growth along the longer side of the tunnel, and there is some control on the doubling index at all points in the tunnel), there are many disjoint balls where u vanishes and the sum of their s.d.i.'s is large. \n\n\n\n\n<ref> Connecting the dots: Proof of Lemma <ref>: In this final section, equipped with Proposition <ref>, Lemma <ref> and Lemma <ref>, we finish the proof of Lemma <ref>. \nRecall that Lemma <ref> is Proposition <ref> with the additional assumption of stable growth. \n\n\n\n\nWe first use Lemma <ref> to get several tunnels where the harmonic function has significant growth along their longer sides. We then use Proposition <ref> to control the doubling index at all points in at least half of these tunnels, thus giving us several good tunnels. \nFinally in these good tunnels, we apply Lemma <ref> to conclude that there are several disjoint balls satisfying the conclusions of Lemma <ref>.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 STABLE GROWTH\n\nThe notion of stable growth has already appeared a few times in the earlier sections; we are finally ready to formally introduce it. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Definition of stable growth and some consequences\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tLet C>1 be a  constant depending only on the dimension n (which will be chosen in Remark <ref>).\n\nA harmonic function u:\u211d^n is said to have stable growth  in a ball B\u2286^n if \n\t\t \n    C^-1(12B) \u2264(2B) \u2264   C (12B).\n\n\nIn (<ref>), the first inequality C^-1( B) \u2264(2B) automatically holds as a consequence of the almost monotonicity of the doubling index (Lemma <ref>). The main point of the stable growth condition (<ref>) is the other inequality, namely, (2B) \u2264 C( B).\n  Any homogeneous harmonic polynomial p of degree N \u2265 1 has stable growth in every ball B(0,r) \u2286^n. Such p can be written as\n\t\t\n    p(r,\u03b8) = r^N q(\u03b8), for r\u2265 0, \u03b8\u2208\ud835\udd4a^n-1,\n\n\twhere q: \ud835\udd4a^n-1 is a spherical harmonic of degree N. Then \n\t\n    sup_B(0,r)|p| = r^Nsup_\ud835\udd4a^n-1|q|,\n\nand the doubling index (0,r) \u2261 N, for every r>0. \n\n\n\tAny harmonic polynomial P has the following representation:\n\n    P(x) = \u2211_k=m^M p_k(x),\n \nwhere p_k is a homogeneous harmonic polynomial in ^n, of degree k. For 0<r\u226a 1 and R \u226b 1, we have \n\n    P(r,\u03b8)     = p_m(r,\u03b8) + O(r^m +1),\n    \n    P(R,\u03b8)     = p_M(R,\u03b8) + O(R^M-1).\n\nHence for small r, we have (0,r) \u224d m; for  large  R, we have (0,R) \u224d M. Hence P has stable growth in balls centered at the origin, whose radius is either small or large.   \n\t\nIn the case M=2m, for the polynomial P(x) = \u2211_k=m^2m p_k(x) we have (0,r) \u224d m for small r, and (0,R) \u224d M \u224d m for large R. So by the monotonicity of the doubling index, (0,t) \u224d m for all t>0. Hence P has stable growth in every ball B(0,r). \n\n\n\n\n\t\nWe observe that if a harmonic function u has stable growth in a ball B=B(x,r) \u2282^n with \ud835\udca9(1/2B)=: N\u2265 1, then because of the close relation between the doubling index and the frequency (Lemma <ref>), the frequency \u03b2 satisfies \n\n    \u03b2_u(x,t)\u2208[c_1 N, C_1 N], \u2200 t\u2208 [1.1r,1.9r]\n\nwhere constants c_1,C_1>0 depend only on n. \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Choosing the stability constant\n\n  Let B=B(0,1) \u2282^n be the unit ball and let u be a harmonic function in 4B.\n\tConsider the spherical layer\n\t\n    \ud835\udcae_\u03c1,w:={x\u2208\u211d^n : \u03c1-10w\u2264 |x|\u2264\u03c1 + 10 w}\u2282 B(2)\\ B(1),\n with width 20w \u2208 (0,\u03c1).\t Suppose that the frequency  of u  in this layer satisfies \n\t\n    \u03b2_u(0,t) \u2208 [N,10N] , for t\u2208 [\u03c1- 10w, \u03c1 + 10w].\n\n\tAlso assume that the layer is not too narrow in terms of N, in the sense that\n\t\n    N w(log1w)^-1n\u226b 1.\n\n\tThen there exists a constant C >0 and a ball D of radius w such that 4D \u2282\ud835\udcae_\u03c1,w satisfying \n\t\n    C^-1( D) \u2264(2D) \u2264C( D),\n\n\tand \n\t\n    (2D) \u224d_n wN.\n\n\n\n\t\n\tFrom now on, we fix the stability constant in  Definition <ref> to be C, as given in the statement of Lemma <ref>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n The following result captures the growth of a harmonic function with stable growth.\n\n\n\n\tLet B=B(0,1) \u2282^n be the unit ball and let u be a harmonic function in 4B.\n Consider the spherical layer\n\t\n    \ud835\udcae_\u03c1,w:={x\u2208\u211d^n : \u03c1-10w\u2264 |x|\u2264\u03c1 + 10 w}\u2282 B(2)\\ B(1),\n with width 20w \u2208 (0,\u03c1).\t Suppose that the frequency  of u is comparable to N>1 in this layer, that is, \u03b2_u(0,t) \u224d_n N  for t\u2208 [\u03c1- 10w, \u03c1 + 10w].

Although we state it specifically for the frequency, \nan analogous statement is true for more general monotone functions \u03c6:[a,b].\n It essentially says that for any  monotone function, it is possible to find a subinterval of significant length where the function is almost constant. \n\n \n   \n   Let u be a harmonic function defined in 4B, with B =B(0,1) \u2282\u211d^n. Suppose that \ud835\udca9(1/2B)=N_1\u226b_n 1 and let \ud835\udca9(2B)=N_2.

Then, since \u03b2(1.1)\u2265 N_1/2 by Lemma <ref> (with \u03b4=10^-10) and the fact that N_1 is large, we have \u03b2(r_k)\u2265 10^k and \n\n    r_k+1- r_k = 1/100 log\u03b2(r_k)\u22641/100 k^2.\n\nSince 100^-1\u2211_k k^-2< 0.5,  the monotonicity of \u03b2(\u00b7), that is Theorem <ref>, implies \n\n    \u03b2(r_k)\u2264\u03b2(1.6),\n\na contradiction to \u03b2(r_k)\u2265 10^k. \n\n\n\nAll in all, we have shown that there exists some r_k_0\u2208 [1.1,1.8] such that \n\n    N_1/2\u2264\u03b2(r_k_0)\u2264 2N_2  and \u03b2(r_k_0+1)\u2264 10 \u03b2(r_k_0),\n\nwhere we have used again Lemma <ref> (with \u03b4=10^-10). Hence, we may take \u03b2(r_k_0)= N and I_n=[r_k_0+1, r_k_0], as required. \n\n\nLemma <ref>  implies Theorem <ref>, under the stable growth assumption. We now show that Theorem <ref> also follows in the general case.\nLet us recall the setting of Theorem <ref>. We have the unit ball B=B(0,1), and a harmonic function u in 4B, which vanishes at the center of B. We wish to get a lower bound for the nodal volume of u in 2B, in terms of ( B).\n\n\nDefine N_1:= ( B) and fix \u03b5 >0. We may assume that N_1 \u226b_\u03b5, n 1, otherwise we may employ the elementary Lemma <ref>.\n\n \n We first use Claim <ref> to conclude that there is N \u2273_n N_1, and an interval \u2110 of length |\u2110| \u224d (log N)^-2 on which \u03b2\u2208 [N,eN].  Then  we apply Lemma <ref> to \u2110 and conclude that there is a ball D of radius \u224d (log N)^-2 with stable growth satisfying: (D) \u224d N(log N)^-2 and 4D \u2282 2B. Finally, we use Lemma <ref> for this ball to get the following lower bound: \n\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 2D)    \u2273_n, (N(log N)^-2)^1-\u00b7 (log N)^-2(n-1)\u2265 N^1-(log N)^-2n\u2265 N^1-2,\n\nwhere the last inequality follows because N \u226b 1. Now since 4D \u2282 2B, we can also conculde that \n\n    \u210b^n-1({u=0}\u2229 2B)    \u2273_n, N^1-2,\n\nand this completes the reduction of Theorem <ref> to Lemma <ref>. \n\nLemma <ref> was already reduced to Proposition <ref>, which is the only thing left to prove. \n\n\nLet N_1=\ud835\udca9(1/2B) and let N_0 be as in Claim <ref>. If N_1\u2264 N_0, then we may apply Lemma <ref> and Theorem  <ref> follows by taking the constant c sufficiently small. Therefore, we may assume that  t N_1=\ud835\udca9(1/2B)\u2265 N_0. Thanks to Claim <ref>, there exists  some N_1/2\u2264 N and some interval I=I_N\u2282 [1/2,2] of length |I|\u224d_n (log N)^-2 such that \u03b2_u(t)\u2208 [N, 10N] for all t\u2208 I. Therefore, by Lemma <ref>, there exists a ball B\u0303 of radius r\u224d_n (log N)^-2 such that 4B\u0303\u2282 B and \n\n    (1/2B\u0303)\u224d_n \ud835\udca9(2B\u0303)\u224d_nN/(log N)^2.\n\nFinally, applying a rescaled version of Lemma <ref>, we find \n\n    \u210b^n-1( {u=0}\u2229 2B)\u2265\u210b^n-1( {u=0}\u2229 2B\u0303) \u2265 r^n-1(1/2B\u0303)^1-\u03b5/2\u2265 N^1-\u03b5,\n\nwhere we have absorbed the logarithmic factors into the term N^-\u03b5.  This concludes the proof of Theorem <ref>. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 REDUCING PROPOSITION <REF> TO THE STABLE GROWTH CASE\n\n\n\n\nThe aim of this section is to show that it suffices to prove Proposition <ref> under the additional assumption that u has stable growth in B. The following result is exactly Proposition <ref> with the extra assumption of stable growth. \n\n\n\n\t  Let B be a unit ball, u: 4B\u2282\u211d^n be a harmonic function and A>1 be a sufficiently large parameter. There exists a constant C_A>1 such that the following holds. Assume that u has stable growth in B and (1/2B)=N\u2265 C_A. Then there exists a collection of disjoint balls  B_i = B(x_i,r_i) such that:\n\t\n\t\n  * We have an upper bound on the doubling index:\n\n    max_i (2B_i) \u2272_n N/A.\n \n\n  * We have a lower bound on the total s.d.i.'s:\n\n    \u2211 (12B_i) r_i^n-1\u2273_n N_1/(log Aloglog A)^n-1.\n\n\n\n  * Vanishing at the center and non-intersection properties:\n\n    u(x_i) = 0, 4B_i \u2229 4 B_j=\u2205, and 4B_i\u2282 2B,\u2200 i\u2260 j.\n\n\n\n\n Let x be the center of B; we will write \u03b2(\u00b7) for \u03b2(x,\u00b7).\n\tDepending on the growth of the frequency \u03b2, we divide the interval [1.1,1.9] as follows. Let k \u2208 be such that k:=\u230alog\u03b2(1.9)\u03b2(1.1)\u230b. For 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k, let a_j \u2208 [1.1,1.9] be such that \u03b2(a_j) = 10^j\u03b2(1.1). Define the interval I_j:= [a_j, a_j+1] of length 20w_j := a_j+1 - a_j. Observe that on each of the intervals I_j, the frequency \u03b2 does not grow more than by a factor of 10. If w_j satisfies \n\t\n    10^j \u03b2(1.1) \u2265 C_n \u00b71w_jlog1w_j,\n\n\tfor some sufficiently large constant C_n>0, then we can use Lemma <ref> to get a ball B_j of stable growth in B(a_j+1)\u2216 B(a_j).\n\tBut some of these intervals I_j can be too short and (<ref>) may not hold for these intervals, and we will discard them. \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will show that the sum of the w_j satisfying (<ref>) is at least 1/2 if \u03b2(1.1) is large enough (which holds because \u03b2(1.1)\u2273\ud835\udca9(1/2B) \u2265 C_A \u226b 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nSince w_j \u2208 (0,1), and x\u2265log x for x>1,  we have \n\n    1/w_j^2\u22651/w_jlog1/w_j.\n\n Hence if w_j^2\u00b7 10^j \u03b2(1.1) \u2265 C_n, then (<ref>) holds. Thus, letting \ud835\udca5 be the collection of indices j for which \nw_j^2\u00b7 10^j \u03b2(1.1) \u2264 C_n, we have\n\n    \u2211_j \u2208\ud835\udca5 w_j \u2264\u221a(C_n/\u03b2(1.1))\u00a0\u2211_j \u22081/10^j/2\u2264\u221a(C_n/\u03b2(1.1)).\n\nHence the sum \u2211_j \u2208\ud835\udca5 w_j < 1/3 for \u03b2(1.1)\u226b 1. Define \n\n    G = {0,1,\u2026,k}\u2216\ud835\udca5.\n\nWe have\n\n    \u2211_j \u2208G w_j \u2265 1/2,\n\nand for each I_j, j \u2208 G, we can apply Lemma <ref> to find a ball B_j such that:\n\n\t\n  * u has stable growth in B_j, and (B_j) \u224d w_j 10^j \u03b2(1.1).\n\t\n  * The radius of B_j is w_j, and 4B_j \u2282 B(0,a_j+1)\u2216 B(0,a_j).\n\t\nThe latter property implies that 4B_j are disjoint. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to simplify the notation, let us write \u03a6(A)= (log A loglog A)^n-1 until the end of the proof. For each B_j, j \u2208G, we use Lemma <ref> to get a collection of disjoint sub-balls {B_i,j}_i, with radii r_i,j and  centers x_i,j, satisfying the following conditions:\n\n\t\n  *   Upper bound for the doubling index:\n\t\n    max_i (2B_i,j) \u2272_n (B_j)/A \u224d_n w_j 10^j \u03b2(1.1)/A.\n \n\t\n  *  Lower bound for the total s.d.i.:\n\t\n    \u2211_i (12B_i,j) r_i,j^n-1\u2273_n (B_j)/\u03a6(A)\u00b7 w_j^n-1\u224d\u03b2(1.1)/\u03a6(A)\u00b7 10^j w_j^n.\n\n\t\n  *  Vanishing at the centers and disjointness: \n    u(x_i,j) = 0,  4B_i,j\u2229 4 B_k,j=\u2205,  and 4B_i,j\u2282 2B_j,\u2200 i\u2260 k.\n\n\nSince w_j\u2264 1, <ref> and Lemma <ref>  imply that\n\n    max_i (2B_i,j) \u2272_n w_j 10^j \u03b2(1.1)/A  \u2272_n \u03b2(1.9)/A\u2272_n \ud835\udca9(2B)/A.\n\nWe observe that <ref> implies (3) in Proposition <ref>. Therefore, we are left to show (2).   It suffices to show that, for j \u2208 G, we have \n\n    \u2211_i,j(12B_i,j)\u00a0 r_i,j^n-1\u2273_n  ( B)/\u03a6(A).\n\nIndeed, summing (<ref>) over all j \u2208 G and using the bound \u03b2(1.1)\u2273\ud835\udca9(1/2B), which follows from Lemma <ref>, we get\n\n    \u2211_j \u2208 G\u2211_i(12B_i,j)\u00a0 r_i,j^n-1\u2273_n  ( B)/\u03a6(A)\u2211_j \u2208 G 10^j w_j^n.\n\nWe will get a lower bound for \u2211_j \u2208 G 10^j w_j^n by using  Holder's inequality which says that, for \u03b1_m, \u03b3_m >0, and p,q \u2265 1 such that p^-1 + q^-1 = 1, we have\n\n    \u2211_m\u03b1_m \u03b3_m \u2264\u2211_m \u03b1_m^p^1/p\u2211_m \u03b3_m^q^1/q.\n\nChoosing p=n, q=nn-1, \u03b1_j = w_j 10^j/n, \u03b3_j = 10^-j/n in (<ref>), we get\n\n    \u2211_j \u2208 G w_j \u2264(\u2211_j \u2208 G 10^j w_j^n)^1/n\u00b7( \u2211_j \u2208 10^-j/n-1)^n-1/n.\n\nBy  (<ref>),  \u2211_j \u2208 Gw_j \u2265 1/2. We deduce that there exists constant c_n>0 such that \n\n    \u2211_j \u2208 G 10^j w_j^n\u2265 c_n.\n\nUsing this in (<ref>), we have shown that (<ref>) holds. This concludes the proof of Proposition <ref> (assuming Lemma <ref>). \n\t\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ZEROS OF A HARMONIC FUNCTION IN A TUNNEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we introduce the notion of a tunnel. A tunnel \ud835\udcaf\u2282^n is a closed hyper-rectangle with all sides  but one of length h>0, while  the length \u2113 of the remaining side is much larger than h. That is, \u2113\u226b_n h. We call h and \u2113 the width and the length of the tunnel respectively. We will always tacitly assume that m := \u2113/ h \u2208. A tunnel  has two faces whose sides are all of length h. We designate one of these to be the beginning face and the other one to be the end face, and we  will denote them by  F_beg and F_end respectively. We can find a unit vector v \u2208^n (which is parallel to the longer side of ) and a\u2208 such that \n\n    F_beg = \u2229{x \u2208^n: v \u00b7 x = a} and F_end = \u2229{x\u2208^n: v \u00b7 x = a+\u2113},\n\nwhere \u00b7 denotes the usual inner product in ^n. We partition  into equal hyper-cubes of side length h, and denote this collection by {q_i}_i=1^m. More precisely, for 1\u2264 k \u2264 m: \n\n    q_k := \u2229{x\u2208^n : a+ (k-1)h \u2264 v\u00b7 x \u2264 a + kh}.\n\nNote that F_beg\u2282 q_1 and F_end\u2282 q_m. We will call subcubes q_1 and q_m the beginning and the end of  respectively. Henceforth, whenever we talk about a tunnel, we implicitly assume that it comes with a choice of the beginning and the end.  \n\nWith  as above, a harmonic function u defined in a neighbourhood of  is said to have logarithmic multiplicative increment (l.m.i.) Z>0 in  if \n\n    logsup_q_m|u|/sup_q_1|u|= Z.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now recall the notion of  the doubling index of a cube introduced in \n(<ref>): given a cube Q with diameter r>0, and a harmonic function on \u221a(n)Q,  we write\n\n    \ud835\udca9^*(Q)= sup_x \u2208 Q,  .05cm \u03c1\u2208 (0,r) (x,\u03c1).\n\nWe recall the notion of \u2113-neighbourhood of a set S \u2282^n:\n\n    S_+\u2113 := {x \u2208^n : x= s+b, where s\u2208 S and b\u2208 B(0,\u2113) }.\n\n\nIn the following lemma, we show that if a harmonic function u has  a large enough multiplicative increment Z in a tunnel , and the doubling indicies in all of the subcubes q_k are much smaller than Z, then the zero set of u in a neighbourhood of  is non-empty and is well spread out. That is, there are many disjoint balls (of radius \u224d h) where u vanishes. \n\n\n\t\n\tLet B \u2282^n be a unit ball and let  u be a harmonic function in 4B. Let \u22821.6B be a tunnel of length \u2113 and width h.  Suppose that  u has l.m.i. Z>1 in , and that  m= \u2113/ h\u226a_n Z. Moreover, suppose that\n\t\n    max_k \ud835\udca9^*(100\u221a(n)q_k)\u2264 Z/V,\n\n\tfor some positive number V \u226a_n Z. Then there exist \u2273_n V many disjoint balls B_k = B(y_k,r_k) such that B_k\u2282_+50\u221a(n)h  and the following holds.\n\t\n\t\t\n  *  \n\t\tVanishing and non-intersection properties:\n\t\t\n    u(y_i) = 0,  4B_i \u2229 4 B_j=\u2205, and  4B_i\u2282 2B,\n \n\t\tfor all i \u2260 j.\n\t\t\n  *  \n\t\tA lower bound for the sum of the doubling indices: \n\t\t\n    Z \u2272_n \u2211_k \ud835\udca9(12B_k).\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLet z_k be the center of q_k.

In <ref> we use information about the distribution of doubling index from Proposition <ref> to prove that many of these  tunnels  are good. Good tunnels are those for which the l.m.i. is at least N, and the doubling index in each of its subcubes is much smaller than N. \nFinally in <ref> we use Lemma <ref> in good tunnels to conclude the proof of Lemma <ref>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Step 1: Constructing tunnels with large multiplicative increment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first start with a lemma about the growth of harmonic functions. \n Let B=B(0,1) \u2282^n and let u be a harmonic function in B. There exists C=C(n)>0 such that the following holds. For every r_1, r_2 satisfying 0< 2r_1 < r_2 < 4^-1, and y \u2208\u2202(r_2B), we have\n\t\n    sup_B(0,r_1)|u| \u2265 |u(y)|(r_2/r_1)^-2\ud835\udca9(0,r_2) - C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWe use monotonicity of doubling index (Lemma <ref>) to see that \n\t\n    |u(y)|/sup_B(0,r_1)|u|\u2264sup_B(0,r_2)|u|/sup_B(0,r_1)|u|\u2264(r_2/r_1)^2\ud835\udca9(0, r_2) +C,\n\n\tas required. \n\n\nConsider a  harmonic function u with stable growth in the unit ball B=B(0,1), with (1/2B) =N. In the following claim, we consider a tunnel  whose end is near a point where |u| attains its maximum on \u2202(1.5 B), and whose beginning is contained well within 1.5B (for example in 1.3B). We show that if \ud835\udcaf is not too narrow, then  u has l.m.i. Z \u2273 N in . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t Let B=B(0,1) \u2282^n. Assume that  a harmonic function u in 4B has stable growth in B. Let x_0 \u2208\u2202 (1.5B) be a point where |u| attains its maximum in 1.5B. \tLet \ud835\udcaf be any tunnel of length 1/4 and width h such that the beginning q_1 satisfies\n\t\n    q_1 \u2282 1.3B.\n\n\tDenote by z_m the center of the ending q_m of  and put r=|z_m -x_0|. Assume that\n\t\n    h \u226a_n 1 and h/2\u2264 r \u226a_n (log1h)^-1\n\n\tand  \n\t\n    ( B) = N \u226b_n 1hlog1h.\n Then u has multiplicative increment Z \u2273_n N in \ud835\udcaf.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLet M=|u(x_0)|. We can apply Lemma <ref> to u in the spherical layer {x\u2208\u211d^n: 1.1\u2264 |x|\u2264 1.9} to conclude that \n\t\n    sup_q_1 |u|\u2264sup_B(0,1.3) |u| \u2264sup_B(0,1.5) |u|exp(-c_1 N) = M exp(-c_1 N)\n\n\tfor some  constant c_1=c_1(n)>0.  We conclude from Claim <ref>  that\n\t\n    sup_q_m |u| \u2265sup_B(z_m, h/4) |u| \u2265 |u(x_0)| 4r/h^-2(z_m,r)-C,\n\n\tfor some C=C(n)>0. Since  \n    Nr(log1r)^-1\u2265 Nh ( log1h)^-1\u226b_n 1\n \n\twe can use  Lemma <ref> to get \n    (z_m, r) \u2272_n rN.\n Let's plug the latter inequality in (<ref>) and use rN \u226b 1 :\n\t\n    sup_q_m |u| \u2265 M (2r/h)^-C_1rN = Mexp(-C_1rN log(4r/h)) \n    \u2265 Mexp(-C_1rN log (1/h))\n\n\tfor some  C_1=C_1(n)>1.\n\tHence, we have the following bound for the multiplicative increment of u in :\n\t\n    Z = logsup_q_m|u|/sup_q_1|u|\u2273_(<ref>),(<ref>) N(c_1 - C_1rlog (1/h)) \u2273 N.\n\n\tIn the last inequality we use the assumption r \u226a_n (log1h)^-1. The proof of Lemma <ref> is finished.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Step 2: Seeking for many good tunnels\n\nA randomly chosen tunnel from Lemma <ref> may have a subcube with doubling index comparable to N. In order to apply Lemma <ref>, we need to ensure that all the subcubes in the tunnel have doubling index \u226a_n N. Such a tunnel will be called a good tunnel. The goal of this section is to construct many good tunnels in Lemma <ref>. \n\n\n\nWe are proving Lemma <ref> and we keep the notation introduced in its statement. Namely, u is harmonic on 4B and has stable growth in B=B(0,1), with (12B) =N. \n\nLet x_0 \u2208\u2202 (1.5B) be such that |u(x_0)| = sup_1.5B|u|.\nDenote by \u211b a tunnel of length 1/4 and width w \u226a 1, whose longer side is parallel to the vector x_0, and x_0 is the center of its end face. We will assume that  (4w)^-1\u2208 so that we could chop \u211b into equal subcubes. \nThen \u211b\u2282 1.6B and its beginning is contained in 1.3B. See Figure <ref> \n\n\n\n\nWe will start chopping \u211b into subcubes and we will need an integer (chopping) parameter K \u226b 1. \nK and w will be chosen later, depending on A in the statement of Lemma <ref>. \nPartition \u211b into equal subcubes {Q_j: 1\u2264 j \u2264 (4w)^-1} of side length w. Also partition \u211b into equal subtunnels {_i: 1 \u2264 i \u2264 K^n-1} of length 1/4 and width w/K. \n\nThe tunnels _i are such that all their beginning faces and end faces  are contained in the beginning face and the end face of \u211b respectively. We denote by {q_i,t: 1\u2264 t \u2264 K(4w)^-1} the subcubes of tunnel _i with side length w/K. See Figure <ref> for a pictorial explanation for this partitioning. \n\n\n\nIt is easy to see that Q_j consists of K^n equal subcubes q_i,t:\n\n    Q_j = \u222a{q_i,t: 1+ (j-1)K \u2264 t \u2264 jK and 1 \u2264 i \u2264 K^n-1}.\n\n\nWe will show  that in at least half of the tunnels _i, the doubling index of all the scaled subcubes 100\u221a(n)q_i,t is much smaller than N, by using a modified version of Proposition <ref>, which is proved in Appendix <ref>. \n Let a unit cube Q \u2282^n be  partitioned into K^n equal subcubes {q_\u03b1: 1\u2264\u03b1\u2264 K^n}. Let u be a harmonic function in 4\u221a(n) Q.  Let ^*(2Q) = N. If K \u226b_n 1, then we have\n\t\n    #{\u03b1 :^*(100\u221a(n)q_\u03b1) \u2265max(N\u00b7 2^-clog K/loglog K,C)}\u2264 K^n-1-c,\n\n\twhere c,C >0 are dimensional constants. \n\n\n\n\nThe next claim is a straightforward consequence of the almost monotonicity of doubling index (Lemma <ref>).\n\n\t\n\tLet B=B(0,1) \u2282^n. Then for every harmonic function u defined in 4B, and every cube Q\u2282 B(0, 1.6) of side length at most (10\u221a(n))^-1, we have \n\t\n    \ud835\udca9^*(Q)\u2272_n \ud835\udca9(2B).\n\n\n\nWe are now ready to show the existence of many good tunnels in \u211b.\n\n\t With the  notation as above, we define \n    N^*(\ud835\udcaf_i) = max_t=1,2,\u2026, K(4w)^-1\ud835\udca9^*(100 q_i,t).\n\n\tIf  K \u226b_n 1 and w\u224d_n (log K)^-1, then \n\t\n    #{i: \tN^*(\ud835\udcaf_i) \u2264  N/ C_K }\u2265K^n-1/2,\n\n\twhere C_K = exp(c' log K/loglog K) for some constant c' = c'(n)>0.\n\t\n\n\nIn total there are K^n-1  tunnels _i. The above lemma implies that  in a neighborhood  of at least  half of these tunnels the doubling index significantly drops down.\n\n\n\n\tIf w \u226a 1, we can apply Claim <ref> to get\n\t\n    ^*(2Q_j) \u2264 C N,\n for some constant C=C(n)>1.\t\n\t\n\tBy Corollary <ref> applied to Q_j we have\n\t\n    #{q_i,t\u2282 Q_j : ^*(100\u221a(n)q_i,t) \u2265 NC2^-clog K/loglog K}\u2264 K^n-1-c,\n \n\tPut c':=c/2 and C_K := exp(c' log K/loglog K).\n\tIf K\u226b 1,then \t\n    N C 2^-clog K/loglog K\u2264 N/C_K.\n  \n\tThere are (4w)^-1 subcubes Q_j. Using the assumptions w^-1\u224d_n log K  and K \u226b 1 we have\n\t\n    #{q_i,t\u2282\u211b : ^*(100\u221a(n)q_i,t) \u2265 N/C_K}\u2272 w^-1 K^n-1-c\u226aK^n-1/2,\n\n\tSince the total number of tunnels _i is K^n-1, we conclude that at least half of them satisfy N^*(\ud835\udcaf_i) \u2264 N/C_K.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Step 3: Concluding the proof of Lemma <ref>\n\nIn order to finish the proof we need to carefully choose the parameters K,w in the construction and chopping of the tunnel \u211b.\nRecall that \u211b has  length 1/4 and width w.  Its subtunnels _i have length 1/4 and width h=w/K. \n\n\n  We can choose a dimensional constant  c_0=c_0(n)>0 and put  w=c_0/ log K so that the the following holds.   If K\u226b_n 1 and  N \u226b_n K(log K)^2, then every tunnel _i \u2282\u211b has a multiplicative increment Z \u2273_n N.  \n\n\n\tFormally,  we just need to check that the assumptions of  Lemma <ref> hold to conclude that the multiplicative increment Z \u2273_n N.\n\t\n\tFor that we need to consider the end cube q of _i and its center z. \n\tRecall that x_0 is the maximum point of u on \u2202(1.5 B) and r:=|z - x_0|.  \n\t\n\tThe assumptions needed for  Lemma <ref> are the following:\n\t\n\t\n\t\n    h/2 \u2264 r,     r \u226a_n  (log1/h )^-1   and   1/hlog1/h\u226a_n N .\n\n\t\n\tThe first inequality holds because x_0 is on the end face of \u211b and z is the center of the end cube q, which is of side-length h. \nMoreover,  the diameter of the end face of \u211b is \u224d_n w.   See figure <ref>.\nSo r \u2272_n w and for the second inequality in (<ref>) it is sufficeint to have \n\n    w \u226a_n ( log1/h )^-1.\n\nIn view of  w=c_0 / log  K and h=K/w, it is equivalent to\n\n    c_0/log K\u00b7logK log K/c_0\u226a_n 1.\n\nThis is the place where we choose the dimensional constant c_0>0, keeping in mind that K\u226b_n 1.\n\nThe third inequality in (<ref>)  holds because we assume N \u226b_n K(log K)^2 and\n\n    1/hlog1/h = K log K/c_0logK log K/c_0\u2272_n K (log K)^2 \u226a_n N.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting the dots and choosing the parameters.\n\nWe have defined w=c_0 / log K.  The constant K\u226b_n 1 is not chosen yet and we  assume N \u226b_n K(log K)^2 .   By the previous Claim <ref> every tunnel _i \u2282\u211b has a multiplicative increment Z \u2273_n N.  \n\nLemma <ref> ensures that half of {_i}_i  satisfy N^*(_i) \u2264 N/ C_K.  \nWe can find a  positive portion of the good tunnels {_i}_i,  which are well-separated.  That is, there is S \u2282{1,\u2026, K^n-1} such that |S|\u2273_n K^n-1,  N^*(_i) \u2264 N/ C_K for each i \u2208 S, and for distinct  i,j \u2208 S:\n\n    (_i)_+50 w/K\u2229 (_j)_+50 w/K = \u2205.\n\n\n\nFinally for every i \u2208 S, we can use Lemma <ref> in _i to obtain a collection of disjoint balls {B_i,k}_k with center y_i,k and radius r_i,k\u224d w/K satisfying the following properties.\n\n\n  *  The doubling index drops down:\n\n    max_k\ud835\udca9 (2B_i,k)\u2264 N/C_K.\n\n\n  *  From condition (<ref>) of Lemma <ref>, we have the following lower bound on the sum of the doubling indices:\n\n    N \u2272_n \u2211_k \ud835\udca9( 12B_i,k).\n\n\n  *  From condition (<ref>) of Lemma <ref>,  we have\n\n    u(x_i,j) = 0, 4B_i,j\u2229 4 B_i,k=\u2205,    and  4B_i,k\u2282 (_i)_+50 w/K\u2282 2B,\n\nfor all i\u2208 S and all j\u2260 k.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we will show that the collection \u22c3_i\u2208 S{B_i,k} satisfies conditions (1), (2) and (3) of Lemma <ref>. \n\nCondition (3) of Lemma <ref>.  almost follows  from <ref>. We need also to show that for two different tunnels \ud835\udcaf_i and \ud835\udcaf_j with i,j \u2208 S  any balls B_i,k and B_j,l are disjoint.  This is why we constructed the tunnels to be well-separated.  Namely, (_i)_+50 w/K, i \n\u2208 S are disjoint while the balls 4B_i,k and 4B_j,l must lie in 50 w/K neighbourhood of the corresponding tunnels. \n\nTo get (1) of Lemma <ref> we will choose K depending on A and n.  Namely,  we choose K so that \n\n    C_K = e^c'log K/loglog K > A\n\nThen  condition <ref> translates to condition (1) in Lemma <ref>.    We also assumed many times that K\u226b_n 1 which follows from the assumption A \u226b_n 1, in Lemma <ref>. Finally we make our choice of K so that\n\n\n    log A \u224d_n log K/loglog K and \tC_K = e^c'log K/loglog K > A .\n\n\nNow the constants w and K are chosen, and we can specify the constant C(A)>1 in Lemma <ref>. The condition \n    N\u226b K (log K)^2\n translates to \n\n    N\u226b C(A) withlog C(A) \u224dlog A loglog A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now need to check (2) of Lemma <ref> and we do this below.  Recall that for every i\u2208 S, each r_i,k\u224d w/K with w\u224d (log K)^-1. Hence from (<ref>) and the fact that |S| \u2273_n K^n-1, we have\n\n    \u2211_i\u2208 S\u2211_k  ( 12B_i,k )\u00a0 r_i,k^n-1\u2273_n |S| w/K^n-1 N \u2273_n w^n-1 N \u224d_n  N/(log K)^n-1.\n \nSince log A \u224d_n log K/loglog K, we have log K \u2272_n  log A \u00b7loglog A, for all large enough K. Hence we get the following lower bound from (<ref>):\n\n    \u2211_i\u2208 S\u2211_k  (12B_i,k)\u00a0 r_i,k^n-1\u2273_n N/(log A \u00b7loglog A)^n-1.\n\nas required. This completes the proof of Lemma <ref>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PROOF OF CLASSICAL RESULTS\n\n\nIn this first part of this section, we prove several known results  about the frequency function which was presented in <ref>. \nRecall that the frequency  of a harmonic function u in \u211d^n is defined by\n\n    \u03b2(x,r)= r G(x,r)/H(x,r),\n\nwhere x\u2208\u211d^n, r>0 and \n\n    H(x,r)= \u222b_\u2202 B(x,r) u^2 dS,      G(x,r)= \u222b_B(x,r) |\u2207 u|^2 d.\n \nThe following well-known identity will be useful in proving that \u03b2(r):=\u03b2(0,r) is a non-decreasing function of r, see <cit.>.\n\n\t\n\tWith the above notation, we have \n\t\n    \u222b_\u2202 (rB) |\u2207 u|^2 = n-2/r\u222b_rB |\u2207 u|^2d  + 2\u222b_\u2202 (rB)(\u2207 u\u00b7n\u0302)^2 dS.\n\n\twhere  n\u0302 is then unit normal vector to the sphere \u2202 (rB) and B=B(0,1).\n\n\n\tWriting 1= r\u0302\u00b7n\u0302 / r, where  n\u0302= r\u0302r^-1 is the unit normal to the sphere \u2202(rB), we have\n\t\n    \u222b_\u2202 (rB) |\u2207 u|^2= r^-1\u222b_\u2202 (rB) |\u2207 u|^2 r\u0302\u00b7n\u0302 dS= r^-1\u222b_rB( |\u2207 u|^2 \u00b7r\u0302) d,\n\n\twhere the second equality follows by the divergence theorem.

We fix t \u2208 (0,), and let r \u2208  [t, ]. Again it follows from (<ref>) that if ( B) <C, then (rB) \u2264 3C. \n\tMultiplying u by a constant, we may assume that \n\t\n    sup_rB|u|=1, \u00a0 and \u00a0sup_B|u|=sup_B u =: M.\n\n\tLet p\u2208\u2202 B be a point such that u(p)=M, and put M'= sup_2B|u|. With the above notation, since 2r\u2264 1, one has\n\t\n    (rB) \u2264log M\t,\u00a0 and \u00a0(B) = logM'/M.\n\n\tFinally, define \n    D:= B(p,1),\u00a0 D_1:= D\u2229 rB,\u00a0 D_2:= D\u2229 (B\\ rB),  and  D_3:= D\u2229 (2B\\ B).\n By the mean value theorem for harmonic functions, we have \n\t\n    M=u(p)= 1/ (D)\u222b_D u  d\u22641/(D)((D_1) + M (D_2) +  M'(D_3) ).\n \n\tSince (D) = (D_1)  + (D_2)+ (D_3), we obtain  \n\t\n    (M-1) (D_1)\u2264 (M'-M)(D_3),\n\n\tthat is \n\t\n    M +(M-1)(D_1)/(D_3)\u2264 M'.\n\n\tLet c= c(t)= (D \u2229 t B)/(D_3), since (D \u2229 t B) \u2286 D_1, we have \n\t\n    1 + cM-1/M\u2264M'/M.\n\n\tTo conclude (<ref>), we consider two cases: the first being when M is very close to 1, and when M is not very close to 1. \n\tIn the first case M= 1+\u03b5, for some small \u03b5\u2264\u03b5_0. Then\n\t\n    \ud835\udca9(rB) \u2264log M =  log (1+\u03b5)\u224d\u03b5.\n\n\tAnd from (<ref>) we get \n\t\n    \ud835\udca9(B)\u2265log(1+c\u03b5/1+\u03b5)\u224d c\u03b5.\n\n\tThus (<ref>) follows. Let us consider the second case: M\u2265 1+\u03b5_0.

This completes the proof of Claim <ref>. \n\n\nThe following claim gives a comparison of the doubling indices in two balls when their radii are much larger than the distance between their centers.  \n  Let B=B(0,1) \u2282^n be the unit ball, and let u be a harmonic function in a neighbourhood of  2B. \n\tLet r >0, and p,q \u2208 B such that |p-q|< r. Also assume that 8r <1, then \n\t\n    (p,2r) \u2272_n (q,4r).\n\n\n\nObserve that \n\t\n    B(q,r) \u2282 B(p,2r) \u2282 B(p,4r) \u2282 B(q,8r).\n\n\tThus one has\n\t\n    sup_B(p,4r)|u|/sup_B(p,2r)|u|\u2264sup_B(q,8r)|u|/sup_B(q,r)|u| = sup_B(q,8r)|u|/sup_B(q,4r)|u|\u00b7sup_B(q,4r)|u|/sup_B(q,2r)|u|\u00b7sup_B(q,2r)|u|/sup_B(q,r)|u|,\n\n\tfrom which one gets\n\t\n    (p,2r) \u2264(q,4r) + (q,2r) + (q,r).\n\n\tIt follows from part two of Claim <ref> that both (q,r), (q,2r) \u2272_n (q,4r). So we get the desired conclusion (p,2r) \u2272_n (q,4r). \n\n\nWith  Claim <ref> and Claim <ref> in hand, we conclude in the following claim that if the doubling index of a harmonic function in a ball is small enough, then it is non-vanishing in a smaller concentric ball.\n\n\n \n Let B=B(0,1) \u2282^n be the unit ball, and let u be a harmonic function in a neighbourhood of  2B. If (14B) \u226a_n 1, then u is non-vanishing in 116B. \n\n Assume that there is a point p \u2208116B where u vanishes. Then it follows from  Claim <ref> that (p,18) \u2265 c, where c>0 is as  in Claim <ref>. Using Claim <ref> for u with q=0, p as above, and r= 1/16, one can conclude that \n\t\n    c \u2264(p,18) \u2272_n  (0,14)=(14B).\n\n\tHence if u vanishes somewhere in 116B, then (14B) \u2273_n 1. This proves Claim <ref>. \n\n\n\nWe now present one final auxiliary  result before proving Claim <ref>. The following claim will be helpful for comparing doubling indices in two sub-balls when  the harmonic function has very small doubling index in a ball. \n\n\n\tLet B=B(0,1) \u2282^n be the unit ball, and let u be a positive harmonic function in a neighbourhood of 2B with u(0)=1.

Claim <ref> and Claim <ref> guarantee the existence of constants C>1 and c>0 respectively such that the following holds. For any non-constant harmonic function f in a neighbourhood of 2B vanishing at its center, one has\n\t\n    _f(B) \u2265log C, \u00a0 and \u00a0sup_2Bf \u2265 c sup_B|f|.\n\t\n\tFix a large k \u2208 such that  c\u00b7 C^k\u2265 4. For this  k, let \u2113\u2208 (0,1) be  such that 18\u2264 2^k \u2113\u226414. The choice of  c_0 \u2208 (0,1) will be made later. \n\t\n\t\n\tFor u  as in the statement of the claim, define v:= u-u(0) = u-1. Then v is harmonic in 2B and  vanishes at its center. Using the first conclusion of (<ref>) repeatedly for v, one gets\n\t\n    sup_2^k\u2113 B |v| \u2265 C^ksup_\u2113 B |v|.\n\n\tThis together with the second conclusion of (<ref>) gives\n\t\n    sup_2^k+1\u2113 Bv \u2265 c \u00b7sup_2^k\u2113 B |v| \u2265 c\u00b7 C^ksup_\u2113 B |v| \u2265 c\u00b7 C^ksup_\u2113 B v.\n\n\tBy the choice of k, we have c \u00b7 C^k\u2265 4, and hence\n\t\n    sup_2^k+1\u2113 Bv \u2265 4 sup_\u2113 B v.\n\n\tHence\n\t\n    sup_2^k+1\u2113 Bu \u2265 1+ 4 sup_\u2113 B v.\n\n\tWe now get a lower bound for the doubling index of u in B.

Hence there is a dimensional constant c_1 >0 such that \n\t\n    1+ 4 sup_\u2113 B v /1 + sup_\u2113 B v  = 1+ 3sup_\u2113 B v /sup_\u2113 B u\u2265 1 + c_1 sup_\u2113 B v.\n\n\tThus from (<ref>) and (<ref>), one has\n\t\n    log (1 + c_1 sup_\u2113 B v) \u2272_n (B).\n\n\tNote that if (B) \u226a 1, then \n\t\n    1\u226b(B) \u2273_n log (1 + c_1 sup_\u2113 B v) \u224dsup_\u2113 B v \u2265_(<ref>) c sup_(\u2113/2) B|v|.\n\n\t Hence if c_0 >0 is small enough, then (B) \u2264 c_0 implies (B) \u2273_nsup_(\u2113/2) B |u-1|.\n\n\t\n\n\nWe are finally ready to prove Claim <ref>. \n \n\t\n\tRecall that in Claim <ref>, it was shown that (rB) \u2272(B) holds whenever either r or (B) is separated from 0. \n\tHence it suffices to prove that there exist dimensional constants r_0 \u2208 (0,1) and C_0 >1 such that \n\t\n    (rB) \u2264 C_0 \u00b7(B),\u00a0\u2200 r \u2208 (0,r_0).\n\n\tLet c_0,\u2113 >0 be as in Claim <ref>. Let c_1 >0 be a small dimensional constant, to be chosen later. \n\tWe now prove (<ref>) for r_0 := \u2113/2^10. If (14B) > c_1, then it follows from part two of Claim <ref> that (B) \u2273(14B) \u2265  c_1, and from part one of Claim <ref> we get that \n\t\n    (rB) \u2272_n(B),\u00a0\u2200 r\u2208 (0,12].\n\n\tHence it suffices to consider the case when (14B)\u2264 c_1.

We will choose c_1 satisfying  this and an additional condition to be specified soon.\n\t2mm\n\tLet >0 and 2r\u2208 (0,r_0) be such that (rB) =. We will now show that  with the above assumption of u being non-vanishing in 116B, one has  (116B) \u2273_n/r and this will prove (<ref>). Let M = sup_rB u, then sup_2rB u = 2^M.

Hence we have the following bound for the gradient at p: \n\t\n    |\u2207 u(p)| \u2273/r.\n\n\tFrom the standard gradient estimates (Claim <ref>), we get \n\t\n    sup_B(p,\u2113/2^6) |u-1| \u2273 |\u2207 (u-1)(p)| = |\u2207 u(p)| \u2273/r.\n\n\tRecalling that \u2113 <1, we have the following comparison for the doubling indices  from Claim <ref> (applied twice):\n\t\n    (p,132) \u2272(0,14)=(14B) \u2264 c_1.\n\n\tWe will choose c_1 small enough so that the above inequality implies (p,132) \u2264 c_0. This together with (<ref>) implies that we can use Claim <ref> to conclude that (p,132) \u2273r. Once again using Claim <ref>, one can conclude that \n\t\n    (116B) = (0,116) \u2273(p,132) \u2273/r\u2265 = (rB).\n\n\tThis completes the proof of Claim <ref>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWe prove this claim in several steps. \n\t\t2mm\n\t\tStep 1: We first show that if (B) is bounded below by a positive constant, then the conclusion of the claim holds.  \n\t\tRecall from Lemma <ref> that\n\t\t\n    \ud835\udca9(rB) \u2264 2\ud835\udca9(B) + C_1,\u00a0\u2200 r \u2208 (0,]\n\n\t\tfor some constant C_1= C_1(n)>1.

Using Proposition <ref> for the cube 2Q with the above partition, one can conclude that if L \u226b_n 1 (which is equivalent to K \u226b_n 1, since K \u224d_n L), then\n\n    #{1 \u2264 j \u2264 L^n: ^*(s_j) > max(Nexp(-c_0 log L/loglog L), C_0)}\u2264 L^n-1-c_0.\n\nFor  cubes 100\u221a(n)q_\u03b1 and s_j, one has\n\n    ^*(100\u221a(n)q_\u03b1)    = sup{(x,r): x\u2208 100\u221a(n)q_\u03b1 and r\u2264 100n/K},\n    ^*(s_j)    \u2265sup{(x,r): x\u2208 s_j  and r\u2264 200n/K}.\n\nIt is easy to see that  every cube 100\u221a(n)q_\u03b1 can be covered by cubes from {s_j}_j; and there is M \u2208 such that for every s_j, there are at most M many cubes in {100\u221a(n)q_\u03b1}_\u03b1 which have non-trivial intersection with s_j.

Let us remind the formulation of the Proposition. \n  \n\n\n\nprop: lemma 1.\nLet a cube Q in \u211d^n be partitioned into A^n equal subcubes Q_i. \n Let u be a harmonic function in 2Q. There exist numerical (depending only on the dimension n) constants A_0,C > 1 and c>0  such that  if A>A_0, then the number of Q_i with \n    N^*_u(Q_i)>max(N^*_u(Q)/exp(- c log A/ loglog A ), C)\n\n is smaller than A^n-1-c\n \n\nThe goal of this section is to provide an informal guide for those who would like to understand the proof of the Proposition <ref>. In order to understand the full details the reader may read pages 221-231 in <cit.> and pages 249-254 in <cit.>, but there are only two facts about harmonic functions, which are used in the proof.\nThe first fact is the monotonicity property of the frequency, which is a powerful tool.\nThe second fact is quantitative Cauchy uniqueness property.\n\n The monotonicity property of the frequency and some considerations from Euclidean geometry imply the following  quasi-additive property of the  doubling index.\n \n \n\n\n\nThere exist a small number c>0 and and a large number C>1, depending on the dimension n, such that the following holds for any harmonic function u in \u211d^n. Suppose that  n+1 points x_1,x_2, ..., x_n+1 in \u211d^n form an equilateral simplex S with side length r. \nAssume that \n    max_1\u2264 i \u2264 n+1 N_u(B(x_i,\u03c1)) \u2265 A,\n where A is any positive number and \u03c1\u2264 r/2.\nLet x be the center of S. \nThen \n    N_u(B(x,C r)) \u2265 A(1+c) - C.\n\n\n \n\nIn the statement above one can replace n+1 balls with centers at the vertices of the equilateral simplex by any other n+1 balls, whose centers form a non-degenerate simplex and the radii are bounded by the diameter of the simplex. But the constants c>0 and C>1 depend on how degenerate the simplex is. We refer to the formal statement of simplex lemma in <cit.>, where the constants depend on the ratio of the width of the simplex and its diameter.\n\n\n The second fact about harmonic functions, which is used in the proof of Proposition <ref>, is quantitative Cauchy uniqueness property.\n \n \n\n\n\nConsider a half-ball \n\n    B_+ = {(x,y)\u2208\u211d^n-1\u00d7\u211d: |x|^2+y^2< 1, y> 0 } .\n\n\nThere exist  \u03b1\u2208(0,1) and C>0 such that if h is harmonic in B_+, h\u2208 C^1(B_+) and satisfies the inequalities |h|\u2264 1, |\u2207 h|\u2264 1 in B_+ and |h|\u2264\u03b5, |\u2202_y h|\u2264\u03b5 on {(x,y)\u2208B_+, y=0}, \u03b5\u2264 1, then \n\n    |h(x)|\u2264 C\u03b5^\u03b1  when   x\u22081/3B_+.\n\n\n\n\n We refer to Appendix of <cit.> for elementary proof. Quantitative Cauchy uniqueness property is used to prove another quasi-additive property of the frequency.\n \n \n\n\n\n There exists a large integer  K>100 and C>1 such that the following holds. Let u be a harmonic function in \u211d^3. \nConsider a finite lattice of points \n    L_K:={ (i,j,0): i=- K, \u2026, K, j=-K, \u2026, K }.\n\nIf  N(B(x,1)) \u2265 A for each x\u2208 L_K and some number A>C, then \n    N(B(0,K))\u2265 2A.\n\n\n\n\nIn the statement of the hyperplane lemma \n one can replace the finite lattice of balls B(x,1), x \u2208 L_K  by any collection of balls B(p_x,r),x \u2208 L_K, with the centers p_x \u2208 B(x,1) and any radius r\u2264 1, and the statement will remain true.\n In the n-dimensional version of hyperplane lemma one should take (n-1)-dimensional lattice of balls.\n \n \n Hyperplane lemma and simplex lemma can be combined together to get the following useful fact about distribution of doubling indices.\n \n\n  Let u be a harmonic function in \u211d^n.   There exist numerical  (depending only on the dimension n) constants A_0 \u2208\u2115, C > 1 and c_1>0  such that  if we partition a cube Q in \u211d^n  into A_0^n equal subcubes Q_i, then the number of Q_i with \n    N^*_u(Q_i)>max(N^*_u(Q)/(1+c_1), C)\n\n is smaller than 1/2 A_0^n-1.\n\n\n\n In the proof Theorem 5.1 from <cit.> the following intuitive principle is used. The simplex lemma implies that \u201cbad\" Q_i with N^*_u(Q_i) > N^*_u(Q)/(1+c_1) should be close to some (n-1)-dimensional hyperplane, and then  one can find a finite \u201clattice\" of \u201cbad\" cubes  and arrive to contradiction with the hyperplane lemma. We refer to <cit.> for details.\n \n \n\n\nProposition <ref> follows from Theorem 5.1 from <cit.> by iterative subdivision of Q into smaller and smaller cubes. One can think that A=A_0^k,  and we subsequently chop cubes into 1/A_0 smaller subcubes and each time we apply Theorem 5.1 to get more information on the distribution of doubling indices.\nThe formal iterative argument is given on pages 249-254 in <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DONNELLY AND FEFFERMAN'S BOUND FOR THE DOUBLING INDEX\n\n\nThe aim of this section is to show how Proposition <ref> follows from the work of Donnelly and Fefferman on complex extensions of real-analytic functions, more precisely from <cit.>.

There exists a holomorphic function u^\u2102 defined in\n \n    \u03a9:={x+ iy \u2208\u2102^n: x\u220815B , y\u220815B}\n\n such that u^\u2102(x)= u(x) for all x\u220815B and \n \n    sup_\u03a9 |u^\u2102| \u2264 C sup_B |u|.\n \n\n\nBy considering a slightly smaller ball and rescaling, we may assume that B=B(0,1)\u2282\u211d^n and u is continuous on B. Then u has a Poisson representation in terms of its boundary values given by \n\n    u(x) = \u222b_\u2202 B P(x,\u03b6) u(\u03b6)dS(\u03b6),     where     P(x,\u03b6)=  c_n 1 - |x|^2 /|x-\u03b6|^n.\n\nThe holomorphic extension of the Poisson kernel is \n\n    P(x+iy,\u03b6)=  c_n 1 - \u2211_k (x_k +iy_k)^2 /(\u221a(\u2211_k (x_k +iy_k-\u03b6_k)^2))^n,\n\nwhere x=(x_1,...,x_n), y=(y_1,...,y_n) and \u03b6=(\u03b6_1,...,\u03b6_n). Indeed, since \u221a(z) is a well-defined holomorphic function for |1-z|<1, it is enough to check\n\n    | 1-\u2211_k  (x_k +iy_k-\u03b6_k)^2|<1.\n\nFor all x+iy \u2208\u03a9, we have \n\n    |\u2211_k (x_k+iy_k)^2|\u2264 2 (\u2211_k x_k^2 +y_k^2)\u22644/25,\n \nand, since \u03b6\u2208\u2202 B, \n\n    |1-\u2211_k (x_k +iy_k-\u03b6_k)^2| = | \u2211_k(x_k +i y_k)^2 + 2\u03b6_k(x_k +iy_k)| \n    \u2264| \u2211_k(x_k +i y_k)^2| +2 \u221a(\u2211_k \u03b6_k^2)\u00b7\u221a(\u2211_k (x_k+iy_k)^2)\u22644/25 + 4/5=1-1/25.\n \nTherefore, P(x+iy,\u03b6) is a well-defined holomorphic function of x+iy in  \u03a9 and \u03b6\u2208\u2202 B. Moreover, \n\n    |\u2211_k (x_k +iy_k-\u03b6_k)^2| \u22651/25.\n\nThus, the absolute value of the denominator in (<ref>) is uniformly bounded from below, and \n\n    sup_x+iy \u2208\u03a9|P(x+iy,\u03b6)|\u2264 C_n.\n\nHence, the Poisson representation gives a holomorphic extension of u onto \u03a9 \n\n    u^\u2102(x+iy) = \u222b_\u2202 B P(x+iy ,\u03b6) u(\u03b6)dS(\u03b6),\n\nsatisfying \n \n    sup_\u03a9 |u^\u2102| \u2264 C sup_B |u|.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLet k be a sufficiently large integer depending on n. Let u(x) be a harmonic function in |x|\u2264 5\u00b7 3^k, x\u2208\u211d^n, and satisfying \n\t\n    max_|x|\u2264 5\u00b7 2^k |u(x)|\u2264 |u(0)| exp (D),\n\n\tfor some D\u226b_n 1. Let Q_0:={(x_1,...,x_n)\u2208\u211d^n: |x_i|\u2264 1,  1\u2264 i\u2264 n } and suppose that R\u228212Q_0 is a sub-cube. Let \u03b5>0. Subdivide R into equal sub-cubes R_i of side length \u2272_n c/D for some sufficiently small c=c(n,\u03b5)>0. Then there exists some constant C=C(n,\u03b5)>1 such that \n\t\n    \ud835\udca9^*(R_i)\u2264 C,\n\n\tfor at least (1-\u03b5) portion of the R_i.\n\n\nThanks to Claim <ref>, we can extend u holomorphically onto |z|\u2264 3^k. Therefore, the function G(z)=(u^\u2102(z))^2 is holomorphic for |z|\u2264 3^k, non-negative and real on Q_0. Moreover, G satisfies   \n\t\n    max_|z|\u2264 2^k |G|\u2264 |G(0)| exp (2D).\n\nTherefore, we may apply Corollary  <ref> and Remark <ref> to see that \n\n    \u222b_\u0393 R_i|u|^2 d/\u222b_R_i|u|^2 d \u2264 C_1,\n\nfor at least (1-\u03b5) portion of the R_i. Hence, Claim <ref> finishes the proof of Lemma \u00a0<ref>. \n\n\nWe are finally ready to present the proof of Proposition <ref>.\n\n\n\t Let N=\ud835\udca9^*(Q) and partition Q into equal sub-cubes Q_j of side length \u224d_ncN for some c=c(n,\u03b5)>0 to be chosen later. We wish to cover the unit cube Q with at most C_n balls B_i=B(x_i,r) of small radius 0<r=r(n)\u226a_n 1 such that \n\t\n    sup_2^10k B_i|u|\u2264 u(x_i)exp(C N),\n\n\twhere k=k(n) is as in Lemma <ref>. We start with any covering of the unit cube by C_n balls B_i' of radius r/2. Put B_i=B(x_i,r), and let x_i be the point in \u2202 B_i such that sup_B_i'|u| = |u(x_i)|. For each B_i',  we have  \ud835\udca9(2^10k+2 B_i')\u2264 N (by the definition of the doubling index of the cube and assuming that r is sufficiently small). Therefore, the almost monotonicity of the doubling index, Lemma <ref>, implies  \n\t\n    sup_2^10k B_i |u|\u2264sup_2^10k+2 B_i'|u|\u2264sup_B_i'|u|exp(C k N)= |u(x_i)| exp(2k N).\n\n\t We may assume that k is sufficiently large. Consider a cube R_i with the following properties. The faces of R_i are parallel to the faces of Q, R_i is a union of a finite number of sub-cubes Q_j, and  \n\t \n    B_i\u2282 R_i \u2282 2^k B_i .\n \n\tSince the B_i cover Q, every cube Q_j is contained in at least one of the R_i.  We apply rescaled Lemma <ref> to the cube R_i partitioned into the Q_j which lie inside R_i. We conclude that, if c=c(n,\u03b5)>0 (the parameter in the side length of the Q_j) is sufficiently small, there exists C=C(n,\u03b5)>1 such that the following holds. For at least (1-\u03b5) portion of the Q_j in R_i, we have  \n\t\n    \ud835\udca9^*(Q_j) \u2264 C.\n\n\tFinally, considering all the C_n choices of R_i, we find that, for\tat least (1-C_n\u03b5) portion of all the Q_j, we have  \n\t\n    \ud835\udca9^*(Q_j) \u2264 C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiam\n\n\n"}
