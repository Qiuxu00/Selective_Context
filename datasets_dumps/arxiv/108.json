In most current experiments, the interactions between particles are short-range and well-modeled by a contact pseudopotential.  However, seminal experiments on dipolar systems formed by magnetic atoms\u00a0<cit.> and polar molecules <cit.> in optical lattices are starting to explore exciting physics beyond the short-range scenario. \n\nDue to the anisotropic and long-range character of the dipole-dipole potential, polar gases confined in optical lattices are  characterized not only by on-site interactions, but, crucially, also by anisotropic inter-site interactions. As a result, dipolar lattice gases of pinned particles \ncan be employed as quantum simulators for spin models, whereas itinerant particles realize different forms of the extended-Hubbard model\u00a0<cit.>. Compared to their non-dipolar counterparts, dipolar lattice gases present a much richer ground-state physics, including crystalline phases\u00a0<cit.> and  supersolids\u00a0<cit.>, or the Haldane-insulator phase\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nThe spatial decay of the inter-site interactions plays a crucial role in polar lattice gases. Due to the form of the dipolar interaction in free space, this decay is typically assumed as 1/r^3, with r the inter-site distance. \nHowever, the interaction decay may be significantly affected by the confinement transversal to the lattice axis\u00a0<cit.>. This confinement alters the on-site wave functions, introducing a modification of the inter-site interaction, which may potentially depart very significantly from the 1/r^3 dependence, and hence alter the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium physics of the polar lattice gas  <cit.>.\n\nIn this paper, we show that the modification of the interaction decay in the presence of a loose-enough transversal confinement results in a significant modification of the ground-state properties of hard-core dipolar bosons. We first consider the case of repulsive interactions, showing that the modified decay results in markedly shifted insulating phases, which translate into a \ndistorted particle distribution in the presence of an overall harmonic confinement. For attractive dipoles, we show that the modified decay may significantly ease the conditions for the realization of self-bound clusters. Moreover, it results in a much wider parameter region for the observation of liquefied self-bound droplets\u00a0<cit.> without the need of super-exchange processes.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThis manuscript is organized as follows. In Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we introduce the lattice model considered, and show how the transversal confinement modifies the inter-site interaction decay. In Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we study the effects of the modified interaction on the phase diagram of repulsive hard-core bosons, whereas  Sec.\u00a0<ref> focuses on the attractive case.  Finally, in Sec. <ref>, we summarize our conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MODIFIED INTERACTION DECAY\n\n\nWe consider dipolar hard-core bosons of mass m confined longitudinally by a 1D optical lattice, U_0sin^2(\u03c0 z/a) with a the lattice constant, and transversally by an isotropic harmonic potential 1/2m\u03c9_\u22a5^2(x^2+y^2), \u03c9_\u22a5 being the trap frequency\u00a0(see Fig. <ref>(a)). The dipole moments are assumed to be oriented by an external field on the xz plane forming an angle \u03b1 with the lattice axis z. Within the tight-binding approximation, the system is well described by the extended Hubbard model\u00a0(EHM):\n\n\n    \u0124=\u2211_i [\n    -t  (b\u0302^\u2020_i+1b\u0302_i\n    +H.c. )\n    +\u2211_j>0V_rn\u0302_in\u0302_i+j  -\u03bcn\u0302_i ],\n\n\nwhere t is the tunneling amplitude between nearest neighbors, b\u0302_i^\u2020 (b\u0302_i) is the creation (annihilation) operator at site i, n\u0302_i=b\u0302_i^\u2020b\u0302_i is the corresponding particle number operator, and \u03bc is the chemical potential. The hard-core constraint means that no double occupancy is allowed, i.e. (b\u0302_i^\u2020)^2=0. This restriction can be achieved by means of strong-enough on-site interactions (which may demand the use of Feshbach resonances). The inter-site interaction between dipoles separated by j sites is given by:\n\n\n    V_r = \u222b d^3r \u222b d^3r'  V(r\u20d7-r\u20d7')|\u03d5(r\u20d7)|^2|\u03d5(r\u20d7-jae\u20d7_z)|^2,\n\n\nwith V(r\u20d7) = C_dd/4\u03c0 r^3(1-3(xsin\u03b1+zcos\u03b1)^2/r^2) being the dipole-dipole interaction. The coupling constant C_dd is \u03bc_0\u03bc^2 for particles having a permanent magnetic dipole moment \u03bc (\u03bc_0 is the permeability of vacuum) and d^2/\u03b5_0 for particles having a permanent electric dipole moment d (\u03b5_0 is the vacuum dielectric constant). \n\nThe on-site wave function can be written as \u03d5(r\u20d7)=\u03c8_0(x,y)W(z), where W(z) is the Wannier function associated with the lowest-energy band, and \u03c8_0(x,y) = e^-(x^2+y^2)/2\u2113_\u22a5/\u221a(\u03c0)\u2113_\u22a5 is the ground-state wave function of the transversal confinement, with \u2113_\u22a5 = \u221a(\u0127/m\u03c9_\u22a5) the harmonic oscillator length. For deep-enough lattices, we may employ the harmonic approximation, W(z)\u2243e^-z^2/2\u2113/\u221a(\u221a(\u03c0)\u2113) with \u2113 = a/(\u03c0 s^1/4) the associated length of the trap, s=U_0/E_R the lattice depth, and E_R=\u03c0^2\u0127^2/2ma^2 the recoil energy. One can show that for \u2113_\u22a5 > \u2113\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n    V_j/E_R = 3B^3/2/2\u03c0^2(3cos^2\u03b1-1)(a_dd/a)f(\u221a(B)j),\n\nwhere a_dd = mC_dd/(12\u03c0\u0127^2) is the dipolar length, B=\u03c0^2/2\u03c7/1-\u03c7/2\u221a(2), \u03c7=\u0127\u03c9_\u22a5/E_R, and\n\n\n    f(\u03be) = 2\u03be -\u221a(2\u03c0)(1+\u03be^2)e^\u03be^2/2erfc(\u03be/\u221a(2)).\n\n\nBy using V=V_1, the interaction potential in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) can be written as V_j=VG_j(B), with G_j(B) = f(\u221a(B)j)/f(\u221a(B)). The resulting interaction decay has hence a universal dependence on the parameter B, which is a function of the confinement parameters only. To further characterize the potential in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), we introduce the parameter \u03b2_eff=-log G_2/log 2 that characterizes the next-to-NN interaction decay i.e. G_2 = 1/2^\u03b2_eff\u00a0<cit.>. For the bare dipole-dipole interaction, \u03b2_eff=3, however, by changing the transversal confinement it can be tuned within the interval 0<\u03b2_eff<3.2\u00a0<cit.>. \nWhen \u2113_\u22a5 < \u2113, \u03b2_eff>3, whereas the opposite is true if \u2113_\u22a5 > \u2113. For the rest of the manuscript, we focus \non the latter case.  In Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b) we plot the spatial dependence of the modified interaction decay for different values of \u03b2_eff. Although for sufficiently large distances the potential in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) recovers the usual dipole-dipole tail, i.e. G_j\u2192\u221e\u2192 1/j^3, the modification of the interaction to the neighboring sites is very significant, and has, as shown below, relevant consequences for the ground-state properties of the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 REPULSIVE POLAR LATTICE GAS\n\n\n\nWe focus first on the ground-state properties for the case of repulsive inter-site interactions, V>0. In absence of dipolar interaction, the standard Hubbard model with hard-core bosons may present only two phases, either a superfluid\u00a0(SF) phase or a band insulator, with filling factor n\u0305=N/L=1, with N the number of bosons and L the number of sites. Note that the latter is equivalent to the vacuum\u00a0(n\u0305=0) due to particle/hole symmetry. In the presence of inter-site dipolar interactions, and depending on the dipole strength V/t and the chemical potential \u03bc the system may present different insulating phases with commensurate fractional fillings\u00a0(devil's staircase)\u00a0<cit.>. \nParticularly relevant are the \nhalf-filled density-wave\u00a0(2DW)\u00a0(n\u0305=1/2), which for t=0 acquires the form |\u22ef     \u22ef\u27e9, and the one-third-filled\u00a0(3DW)\u00a0(n\u0305 =1/3) \n|\u22ef       \u22ef\u27e9\u00a0(or equivalently the phase with n\u0305=2/3). Other fractional fillings are possible but they require significantly larger V/t ratios. \n\nWe are interested in how the modified interaction decay alters the boundaries of the insulating phases. We employ density-matrix renormalization group\u00a0(DMRG) techniques to obtain the ground-state of a system of L=120 sites, assuming periodic boundary conditions. Superfluid\u00a0(insulating) phases are characterized by a polynomial\u00a0(exponential) decay of the single-particle\ncorrelation, \nC_SF(i,j)=\u27e8\u00e2_i^\u2020\u00e2_i+j\u27e9. To distinguish amongst the different insulating phases, we evaluate the structure factor \n\nM(k)=1/L\u2211_j=1^L-1e^-ikj\u27e8n\u0302_in\u0302_i+j\u27e9, \n\nwhere k\u2208[-\u03c0, \u03c0] is the quasi-momentum. For an insulating phase with filling n\u0305=1/m, M(k) presents peaks \nat k=\u00b12\u03c0/m. Due to particle-hole symmetry, the same is true for the phase with n\u0305=m-1/m. Note that particle-hole symmetry results in a mirror symmetry of the phase diagram on the \n(t/V,\u03bc/V) plane around the chemical potential (\u03bc/V)_0(B)=\u2211_j>0G_j(B). \nIn order to compare properly the results for different B values, we introduce the re-scaled chemical potential, \u03bc\u0303=\u03bc/(2\u2211_j>0G_j(B)), such that the phase diagram presents mirror symmetry around \u03bc\u0303/V=1/2. \nWith this shift, the borders of the band insulator, n\u0305=1, and the \nvacuum, n=0, are given by \u03bc\u0303/V=0,1. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Fig.\u00a0<ref>\u00a0(top), we depict the phase diagram for a \n1/r^3 decay\u00a0(blue), and for the modified dipolar interaction with \u03b2_eff=2\u00a0(red). The central lobe, which corresponds to the 2DW phase, is significantly smaller for \u03b2_eff=2. This must be compared to the results of Ref.\u00a0<cit.>, which focused on the case \u2113_\u22a5\u226a\u2113\u00a0(and hence \u03b2_eff\u2273 3), for which the modification of the 2DW lobe compared to that expected for the 1/j^3 dependence is very small. \n\n\nThe relative deviation from the results considering\nthe standard 1/j^3 dependence is even more relevant \nfor insulating phases at lower fillings. In Fig.\u00a0<ref>\u00a0(top) we observe as well the lobes with filling n\u0305=1/3 and n\u0305=1/4, and the particle/hole symmetric ones for n\u0305=2/3 and n\u0305=3/4. Note that these lobes, which are depicted in detail in the inset, are significantly modified. In particular, for \u03b2_eff=2, the critical V/t for the observation of the 3DW is strongly reduced from a critical V/t \u2243 47 to V/t\u2243 27. Figure\u00a0<ref>\u00a0(bottom) shows the critical (V/t)_cr for 2DW and 3DW, as a function of \u03b2_eff, normalized to the value expected for a 1/j^3 decay. Note that for 2DW\u00a0(3DW) (V/t)_cr increases\u00a0(decreases) by \napproximately a factor of 2 when reducing \u03b2_eff down to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lobes are also changed in their dependence with chemical potential. In addition to the above-mentioned (\u03bc/V)_0(B) shift, the width\u00a0(in chemical potential) of the 2DW\u00a0(3DW) lobe significantly shrinks\u00a0(widens) with decreasing \u03b2_eff. This is illustrated in Fig.\u00a0<ref>\u00a0(top), where \nwe consider t=0, for which the \nphase boundaries may be evaluated analytically. \n\nThe modification of the insulating lobes has significant consequences \nfor the spatial particle distribution in the \nthe presence of an overall harmonic confinement.\nThe confinement results in an additional term \u03a9\u2211_i(i-L/2)^2n\u0302_i in \nEq.\u00a0(<ref>). For a sufficiently weak confinement, local-density approximation \narguments apply, and the density profile presents the expected wedding-cake profile. Figure\u00a0<ref>\u00a0(bottom) shows the local mean occupation \u27e8 n_i\u27e9. In the plateaus, which characterize \nthe DW phases, we average over neighboring sites to flatten the DW oscillations in \u27e8 n_i\u27e9. In agreement with the phase diagram, the central 2DW plateau shrinks while the 3DW plateau widens when decreasing \u03b2_eff. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ATTRACTIVE POLAR LATTICE GAS\n\n\n\nWe analyze at this point the case of  V<0, focusing first on the simplest case of just two bosons, and then discussing the formation of self-bound lattice droplets.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Dimers\n\n\nThe wave function characterizing a state of two bosons can be separated as \u03a8(R, r) = e^iKR\u03a6_K(r), where R=(i_1+i_2)/2 is the center-of-mass, r=i_1-i_2 is the relative coordinate, and i_j=1,2 is the lattice site in which particle j is. The wave function \u03a6_K(r) depends on the center-of-mass quasi-momentum K\u2208[-\u03c0, \u03c0], and satisfies the Schr\u00f6dinger equation \u0124_K|\u03a6_K\u27e9 = E_K\u03a6_K, with \n\n\n    \u0124_K   =    -2tcos (Ka/2 )\u2211_r\u2265 1 (|K, r+1\u27e9\u27e8 K, r| + H.c.) \n       +    V\u2211_r\u2265 1G_j(B)|K,r\u27e9\u27e8 K, r|,\n\n\nwhere |K, r\u27e9 stands for the state with center-of-mass quasi-momentum K, and inter-particle separation r. Diagonalizing \u0124_K for different K \nin the Brillouin zone provides the energy spectrum,  \ndepicted in Fig.\u00a0<ref> for V/t=-4 and different values of \u03b2_eff. Compared to the case 1/r^3 for the same V/t, the modification of the dipolar tail results in additional bound eigenstates. \n\nThe two-body ground-state is given for all \u03b2_eff values by a bound pair  with K=0, and a spatial distribution peaked at nearest neighbors. However, the binding becomes stronger, i.e. pairing (and in general the formation of clusters, as discussed below) demands a smaller |V|/t when \u03b2_eff decreases. \n\nFurthermore, dimer mobility may be strongly modified by tuning the transversal confinement. \nNote that the curvature of the lowest branch at K=0, associated with the effective mass of the ground-state dimer, is significantly modified as a function of \u03b2_eff. \nThis is best illustrated with the case of strong V/t, for which the lowest bound-state branch corresponds to bound nearest-neighbor dimers, which \nmove via second-order hopping with amplitude \n\n    t_D=1/1-2^-\u03b2_efft^2/V.\n\nThis should be compared to the corresponding value t_D = 8t^2/7V for the case of 1/r^3 decay. Note that e.g. for \u03b2_eff=1, t_D = 2 t^2/V, and hence the dimer dynamics is approximately twice faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Self-bound lattice droplets\n\n\nThe formation of bound dimers in the two-body problem extends in the many-body case to the formation of self-bound lattice droplets formed by potentially many particles. These resemble those recently discussed in binary mixtures\u00a0<cit.> and cavities\u00a0<cit.>. Dipolar self-bound lattice droplets have been discussed in the context of out-of-equilibrium polar lattice gases after a quench of the confinement potential\u00a0<cit.>. Very recently, ground-state self-bound dipolar lattice droplets were studied in Ref.\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nAlthough self-bound lattice droplets present some interesting similarities to quantum droplets in binary and dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates\u00a0<cit.>, they differ from them \nin the physical mechanism as well as in the fact that lattice droplets are self-pinned, i.e. they remain for any practical purposes immobile, due to their large effective mass.\n\nIn Ref.\u00a0<cit.>, it was shown that droplets \ncan be either a self-bound Mott insulator\u00a0(with saturated unit filling) or in a liquefied state\u00a0(self-bound but with a filling lower than unity). It was argued that liquefaction arises due to the interplay between inter-site dipolar attraction and the super-exchange processes originating from short-range repulsion in soft-core Bose systems. \n\nIn the following, we show that self-bound droplets in hard-core gases (where super-exchange is absent) are generally in either a saturated or liquid regime, and that the boundaries between the saturated, liquid, and unbound\u00a0(gas) phases are \nstrongly dependent on \u03b2_eff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to analyze self-bound lattice droplets, we develop a variational approach similar to that used in Ref.\u00a0<cit.>. We assume that the impenetrable lattice gas is well described by a Tonks-Girardeau |\u03a8_TG\u27e9=\u03a0_k<k_Fb\u0302_k^\u2020|0\u27e9 ansatz with the density n=k_F/\u03c0 as a variational parameter, k_F being the Fermi momentum of the fermionized bosons. Evaluating  \u27e8\u03a8_TG|\u0124|\u03a8_TG\u27e9 yields the energy per particle\n\n    E[n]/tN = -2sin n\u03c0/n\u03c0+V/tn\u2211_r>0G_r[1-sin^2n\u03c0 r/\u03c0^2r^2].\n\nThe first and second terms are associated with the kinetic energy and the modified dipolar interaction, respectively.\nFollowing Ref.\u00a0<cit.>, we classify the quantum phases of the dipolar system according to the value of the density n_c at which the energy per particle is minimal. In the unbound\u00a0(gas) phase, the dipoles spread uniformly over all available sites. As a result, the gas phase is characterized by a vanishing density n_c=0. In contrast, in a liquid phase, where the droplets are self-bound and localized at zero pressure <cit.>, the energy per particle takes its minimal value at a finite density 0<n_c<1. Furthermore, the energy per particle at n_c is smaller than the bottom of the scattering band, i.e E[n_c]/N<-2t. Lastly, we define the saturated droplet regime as that in which the energy per particle becomes minimal at n_c=1. In such a phase, the droplet is incompressible and hole propagation within the droplet is inhibited due to the high energy cost of breaking a dipole bond <cit.>. In Fig. <ref>, we show, in a color scheme, the resulting phase diagram of impenetrable dipolar bosons as a function of the interaction strength |V|/t and \u03b2_eff. The saturated droplet regime is indicated in red, whereas the liquid and gaseous phases in white and blue, respectively. In stark contrast to the bare dipolar potential 1/r^3\u00a0<cit.>, the modified interaction gives rise to a wide liquefied region without removing the hard-core constraint.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned variational approach, we calculate the ground state of the dipolar system for different values of |V|/t using DMRG simulations with N=24 bosons in L=80 sites. In our DMRG simulations, we define the gas-to-liquid transition at the interaction strength |V_c|/t in which the energy per particle is equal to the bottom of the scattering band E/N = -2t. Meanwhile, we define the saturated droplet regime as that in which the central density of the ground state reaches unity, i.e. the density distribution acquires a flat-top profile. Note that the wings of the droplet are not necessarily saturated, although when |V|/t increases eventually the whole droplet enters the unit filling regime. Green circles and orange stars in Fig.\u00a0<ref> correspond to our DMRG results for the gas-to-liquid and liquid-to-saturated boundaries, respectively. A good agreement is found between the variational and numerical results. Note as well, that the gas-to-liquid transition is well-estimated by the threshold of dimer bound-state formation (dashed line in Fig.\u00a0<ref>), obtained from the two-body calculations discussed above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nA sufficiently loose transversal confinement  results in a significant \nmodification of the inter-site interaction between dipoles in a one-dimensional optical lattice, which departs from the usually assumed \n1/j^3 dependence. We have shown that this modification, which \nacquires a universal dependence on the confinement parameters, may significantly modify the ground-state properties of hard-core bosons. For repulsive dipoles, it leads to a marked shift of the boundaries of the insulating devil's staircase phases, that translates in a significantly modified particle distribution in the presence of an overall harmonic potential. For attractive dipoles, the modified interaction decay results in a lower critical dipolar strength for the formation of self-bound clusters, \nand to a much wider parameter region for the observation of liquefied droplets without the need of super-exchange processes. The discussed effects should play a relevant role in future lattice experiments on magnetic atoms or polar molecules.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) \u2013 Project-ID 274200144 \u2013 SFB 1227 DQ-mat within the project A04, and under Germany's Excellence Strategy \u2013 EXC-2123 Quantum-Frontiers \u2013 390837967.
