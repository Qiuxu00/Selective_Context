The weak value of a given\nobservable obtained via a weak measurement, although is in general a complex\nnumber, has been shown to carry information about the system at times between\npre and post-selction\u00a0<cit.>. Weak measurements  allow\nus to sequentially measure incompatible observables so as to gain useful\ninformation from the quantum system and learn about the initial state without\nfully collapsing the state\u00a0<cit.>.  This is in complete contrast\nto conventional projective measurements, wherein the system collapses into one\nof the eigenstates resulting in maximum state\ndisturbance\u00a0<cit.>.  This feature of weak measurements provides\nan elegant way to address several important issues in quantum theory including\nthe reality of the wave function<cit.>,\nobservation of a quantum Cheshire Cat in a matter-wave interferometer\nexperiment<cit.>, observing single photon trajectories in a\ntwo-slit interferometer<cit.>, and the Leggett-Garg\ninequality<cit.>. Weak measurements are also actively exploited\nin the field of quantum information processing covering a wide range of\napplications including quantum state and process\ntomography<cit.>, state protection against\ndecoherence<cit.>, quantum state\nmanipulation<cit.>, performing minimum disturbance\nmeasurements<cit.>, precision measurements and quantum\nmetrology<cit.>, sequential measurement of two non-commuting\nobservables<cit.> and tracking the precession of single nuclear\nspins using weak measurements<cit.>. \n\n\nSeveral techniques have focused on direct estimation of quantum states and\nprocesses including a method based on phase-shifting\ntechnique\u00a0<cit.> and  direct measurement of quantum\nstates without using extra auxiliary states or post-selection\nprocesses\u00a0<cit.>.  A selective QPT protocol based on quantum\n2-design states was used to perform DQPT\u00a0<cit.> and\nexperimentally demonstrated on different physical\nplatforms<cit.>.  Conventional QST\nand QPT methods require a full reconstruction of the density matrix and are\ncomputationally resource intensive.  On the other hand, weak measurement based\ntomography techniques have been used to perform state tomography and it was\nshown that for certain special cases they outperform projective\nmeasurements\u00a0<cit.>.  An efficient DQST scheme was proposed\nwhich directly measured arbitrary density matrix elements using only a single\nstrong or weak measurement\u00a0<cit.>.  Circuit-based weak\nmeasurement with post-selection has been reported on NMR ensemble quantum\ninformation processor\u00a0<cit.>. \n\n\nIn this work, we propose an experimentally efficient scheme\nto perform direct QST and QPT using weak measurements of\nPauli spin operators on an NMR ensemble quantum information\nprocessor. The scheme allows  us to compute \ndesired elements of the density matrix and is designed in such a way that\nit does not require any ancillary qubits and has reduced\ncomplexity as compared to recently proposed weak\nmeasurement-based DQST and \nDQPT methods\u00a0<cit.>.  Our scheme has three\nmajor advantages, namely, (i) it  does not require\nsequential weak measurements, (ii) it does not involve\nimplementation of complicated error-prone quantum gates such\nas a multi-qubit, multi-control phase gate and (iii) it does\nnot require projective measurements.  Furthermore, our\nproposed method is experimentally feasible as it requires a\nsingle experiment to determine multiple selective elements\nof the density/process matrix.  Our scheme is general and can be\napplied to any circuit-based implementation. We\nexperimentally implemented the scheme to characterize several\ntwo-qubit quantum states and single-qubit quantum processes\nwith high fidelity. Further, we fed the weak measurement\nexperimental results as input into a convex optimization\nalgorithm to reconstruct the underlying valid states and\nprocesses<cit.>.  We compared the experimentally\nobtained state and process fidelities with theoretical\npredictions and with numerical simulations and obtained a\ngood match within experimental uncertainties.\n\n \nThis paper is organized as follows: A brief review of weak\nmeasurements and the detailed schemes for DQST and DQPT are\npresented in Section\u00a0<ref>.  The details of the\nexperimental implementation of DQST and DQT via weak\nmeasurements are given in Section\u00a0<ref>.\nSection\u00a0<ref> describes how to use an NMR quantum\nprocessor to perform weak measurements of Pauli spin\noperators, while Sections\u00a0<ref> and <ref>\ncontain details of a weak measurement of the Pauli operator\n\u03c3_1z and the results of DQST and DQPT performed\nusing weak measurements, respectively.  Section\u00a0<ref>\ncontains a few concluding remarks.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 GENERAL SCHEME FOR DIRECT QST AND QPT VIA WEAK MEASUREMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the system and the measuring device initially\nprepared in a product state |\u03c8\u27e9| M \u27e9. The weak measurement\nof an observable A requires the evolution of the joint\nstate |\u03c8, M \u27e9 under an operator of the form,\nU_SM = e^-ig A\u2297B, where g is coupling\nstrength (| g |\u226a 1) between the system and the\nmeasuring device.  The operator B corresponding to the\nmeasuring device is chosen such that \u27e8 M |B| M \u27e9 =0.  In the weak measurement limit (|\ng |\u226a 1), the evolution operator can be approximated\nupto first order in g as, U^weak_SM = (I -ig\nA\u2297B ) and the evolution of the joint state\n(system+measuring device) can be worked out as follows\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n    |\u03c8, M \u27e9_ final    =      e^-ig A\u2297B|\u03c8, M \u27e9\n       \u2248     (I -ig A\u2297B ) |\u03c8, M \u27e9\n        =    |\u03c8, M \u27e9 - ig A|\u03c8\u27e9\u2297B| M \u27e9\n\nWe will see that the above equation can be used for QST and\nQPT by making appropriate measurements on the measuring\ndevice.\n\n\nGenerally quantum processes are\neither represented via the corresponding (i) \u03c7 matrix\n(also referred to as the process matrix) using a Kraus\noperator decomposition<cit.> or (ii)\nChoi-Jamiolkowski state using the channel-state duality\ntheorem\u00a0<cit.>.  For an N-qubit system, the\n\u03c7 matrix and the Choi-Jamiolkowski state corresponding\nto quantum channel \u039b are given by\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n    \u039b(\u03c1_in)    =   \u2211_i=0^4^N-1K_i\n    \u03c1_in K_i^\u2020 = \u2211_m,n=0^4^N-1\u03c7_mnE_m \u03c1\u0302_inE_n^\u2020\n    |\u03a6_\u039b\u27e9   =    (I \u2297\u039b\n    )|\u03a6\u27e9=1/2^N / 2\u2211_m=0^2^N-1| m\n    \u27e9\u2297\u039b| m \u27e9\n\nwhere \u03c7_mn in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) are elements of the \u03c7\nmatrix and |\u03a6_\u039b\u27e9 in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>)\nis the Choi-Jamiolkowski state;  { K_i }'s and\nthe {E_i }'s in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) are Kraus\noperators and fixed basis operators respectively, while the\nquantum state |\u03a6\u27e9 in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is a pure\nmaximally entangled state of 2N qubits |\u03a6\u27e9=2^-N\n/ 2\u2211_m=0^2^N-1|m\u27e9|m\u27e9. The density\nmatrix \u03c1_\u039b = |\u03a6_\u039b\u27e9\u27e8\u03a6_\u039b| corresponding to the\nChoi-Jamiolkowski state can be mapped to the \u03c7 matrix\nusing an appropriate unitary transformation U_\u03c7 as\n\u03c7 = U_\u03c7\u03c1_\u039b U^\u2020_\u03c7. The\nunitary transformation matrix U_\u03c7 depends only on\nthe fixed set of basis operators { E_i}\n(Eq.\u00a0(<ref>)) and does not depend on the quantum channel\nto be tomographed. To perform DQPT of a given quantum\nchannel \u039b in terms of the \u03c7 matrix, we need to\napply the unitary transformation U_\u03c7 on |\u03a6_\u039b\u27e9 and then follow the direct QST\nprotocol and estimate the desired elements \u03c7_mn.\n\n\n\nConsider the operators O^\u03d5_x = |\u03d5\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5|\u2297\u03c3_x and O^\u03d5_y = |\u03d5\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5|\u2297\u03c3_y where |\u03d5\u27e9 is a  pure\nsystem state \nand \u03c3_x(y) are single-qubit Pauli spin operators. \nThe expectation values of \nthe O^\u03d5_x and O^\u03d5_y operators in\nthe weakly evolved joint state (Eq.\u00a0(<ref>)) turn out to be:\n\n    \u27e8 O^\u03d5_x \u27e9    =     ig [ \u27e8\u03c8|\n    A^\u2020|\u03d5\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5|\u03c8\u27e9 - \u27e8\u03d5| A |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8|\u03d5\u27e9] \n    \u27e8 O^\u03d5_y \u27e9    =     -g [ \u27e8\u03c8|\n    A^\u2020|\u03d5\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5|\u03c8\u27e9 + \u27e8\u03d5| A |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8|\u03d5\u27e9]\n\nwhich can be simplified to:\n\n    \u27e8 O^\u03d5_y \u27e9 - i \u27e8 O^\u03d5_x\n    \u27e9/-2g = \n    \u27e8\u03d5| A |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8|\u03d5\u27e9\n\nStraightforward algebra leads to \n\n    \u27e8 O^\u03d5_y \u27e9 - i \u27e8 O^\u03d5_x\n    \u27e9/-2g = \u03c1_mn = \u27e8 m |\u03c1| n\n    \u27e9\n\nSimilarly,\n\n    \u27e8 O^\u03d5_y \u27e9 - i \u27e8 O^\u03d5_x\n    \u27e9/-2g =  \u03c7_mn = \u27e8 m |\u03c7| n\n    \u27e9\n\nUsing Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>) and \n(<ref>), one can perform direct\nQST and QPT by measuring \u27e8 O^\u03d5_x \u27e9 and\n\u27e8 O^\u03d5_y \u27e9 for an appropriate choice of\nA and |\u03d5\u27e9. \n\n\nIt is interesting to note that \n\n    \u27e8\u03d5| A |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8|\u03d5\u27e9=\u27e8 A\n    \u27e9_w^\u03d5\u03a0_\u03c8^\u03d5\n\nwhere \u27e8 A\n\u27e9_w^\u03d5 is the weak value associated with a\npost-selection of the system into the state \u03d5 and \u03a0_\u03c8^\u03d5 is the post-selection\nprobability\u00a0<cit.>\nWe do not use this connection is our work,\nhowever, it connects our work with other schemes involving\nweak values and post-selection.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 NMR IMPLEMENTATION OF WEAK MEASUREMENT SCHEME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 NMR weak measurements of Pauli spin operators\n \n\nWe used the three ^19F spins in the molecule trifluoroiodoethylene\ndissolved in acetone-D6 to realize three qubits, denoting F_1 and F_2 as the system qubits and F_3  as the meter qubit (Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c)).\nThe rotating frame NMR Hamiltonian for a system of \nthree spin-1/2 nuclei is given by\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n    \u210b=-\u2211_i=1^3\u03bd_i I_i z+\u2211_i, j=1, i>j^3 J_i j I_i z I_j z\n\nwhere \u03bd_i and I_iz are the chemical shift and the z-component of the\nspin angular momentum of the ith spin respectively, and J_ij is the scalar\ncoupling between the ith and jth spins.  Experimental parameters\ncharacterizing the given system can be found in the\nReference\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nWe set the initial state of the meter qubit to be | M\n\u27e9 = | 0 \u27e9_m, \nwith B = \u03c3_x  (Eq.\u00a0(<ref>)). In this\ncase, the weak interaction evolution operator U^weak_SM is of\nthe form:\n\n    U^weak_SM = I -ig P_k\u2297\u03c3_x\n\nwhere I is an 8 \u00d7 8 identity matrix and P_k = { I, \u03c3_x,\n\u03c3_y, \u03c3_z }^\u2297 2 are two-qubit Pauli spin operators. \nThe operator U^weak_SM given in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) can be decomposed as:\n\n    I -ig P_k\u2297\u03c3_x   =   I -ig (U_k\u03c3_iz U_k^\u2020) \u2297 (R_y(\u03c0/2) \u03c3_z R_y^\u2020(\u03c0/2)) \n       =   \ud835\udcb0_k (I -ig \u03c3_iz\u2297\u03c3_z) \ud835\udcb0_k^\u2020\n\nwhere \u03c3_iz is either \u03c3_1z = \u03c3_z \u2297 I or \u03c3_2z\n= I \u2297\u03c3_z and \ud835\udcb0_k = U_k \u2297 R_y(\u03c0/2);\nU_k is a two-qubit unitary operator acting on system qubits and is\nconstructed such that P_k = U_k\u03c3_iz U_k^\u2020. To further\nsimplify Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), consider the J-evolution operator U_ij^J(t):\n\n    U_i j^J(t)=e^-i 2 \u03c0 J_ij I_i z I_j z t\n\nIf the evolution time t is sufficiently small such that g = \u03c0 J_ij\nt/2\u226a 1, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) can be approximated as:\n\n    U_i j^J(t) \u2248 I - i g \u03c3_iz\u2297\u03c3_jz\n\nHence using Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>) and (<ref>):\n\n    U^weak_SM\u2248\ud835\udcb0_k U_ij^J(t) \n    \ud835\udcb0_k^\u2020\n\nwhere t = 2g/\u03c0 J_ij, i = 1,2 and j=3.\n\nHence the weak measurement of a desired Pauli operator P_k can be performed by\napplying the sequence of unitary operations given in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) on an\ninitial joint state of the three-qubit system followed by the measurement of\nO^\u03d5_x and O^\u03d5_y. The list of \ud835\udcb0s corresponding to all\nP_ks is given in Table\u00a0<ref>.\n\nFor the NMR implementation, the quantum circuit depicted in Fig.<ref>(a) is\ndivided into six parts, each consisting of a set of unitary operations.  Each of\nthe six parts are implemented using optimized pulse sequences generated through\nGRAPE, which are represented graphically as colored Gaussian shapes in\nFig.\u00a0<ref>(b).  For example, the first part of the circuit consists of a\nHadamard gate followed by a CNOT gate, and this composite operation is\nimplemented using a GRAPE pulse denoted by G_1 in Fig.<ref>(b).  The\napproximate length of the GRAPE optimized rf pulses corresponding to given\nquantum states (or processes) and Pauli operators is given in Table\u00a0<ref>.\nThe power level was set to 28.57\u00a0W in all the experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 NMR Measurement of O_x^\u03d5 and O_y^\u03d5\n\nFor simplicity, consider the post-selected state |\u03d5\u27e9 to be one\nof the computational basis vectors: {| 00\u27e9, | 01 \u27e9,\n| 10 \u27e9, | 11 \u27e9} which are required to\nperform DQST or DQPT (Eq.\u00a0(<ref>)). In this case, it turns out that\nthe observables O_x(y)^\u03d5 can \nbe directly measured by acquiring the NMR signal\nfrom F_3 (the meter qubit).  The NMR signal of F_3\nconsists of four spectral peaks (see thermal spectra in blue color in\nFig.\u00a0<ref>(a)) corresponding to four transitions \nassociated with density matrix elements (referred to as readout \nelements):\u00a0\u03c1_56, \u03c1_12, \u03c1_78 and\n\u03c1_34\u00a0<cit.>. \nThe first peak from \nthe left \nin Fig.<ref>(a) \ncorresponds to the post-selected state |\u03d5\u27e9 = | 10\n\u27e9 while \nthe second, third and fourth peaks correspond to \nthe post-selected states | 00 \u27e9, |\n11 \u27e9 and | 01 \u27e9, respectively. These peaks (from \nthe left) are also\nassociated with readout elements \u03c1_56, \u03c1_12, \u03c1_78 and\n\u03c1_34, respectively. \nThe line intensity of the absorption mode spectrum (x-magnetization) \nis proportional to the real part of \nthe corresponding readout element of the density matrix while the\ndispersion mode spectrum (y-magnetization) is proportional \nto the imaginary part of the corresponding readout\nelement: \n\n    \u27e8 O_x^\u03d5\u27e9\u221d Re(\u03c1_ij)    and  \u27e8 O_y^\u03d5\u27e9\u221d Im(\u03c1_ij)\n\nwhere \u03c1_ij is the readout element of the three-qubit density matrix on\nwhich the observables O_x(y)^\u03d5 are being measured. The complete list of\nobservables \u27e8 O_x(y)^\u03d5\u27e9 with corresponding spectral\ntransitions and readout elements are listed in Table\u00a0<ref>.\nNote that in the case of an arbitrary post-selected state |\u03d5\u27e9,\none has to decompose the observables O_x(y)^\u03d5 into Pauli basis\noperators as O_x(y)^\u03d5 = \u2211_i a_i^x(y)P_i, then measure \u27e8 P_i\n\u27e9 corresponding to non-zero coefficients a_i^x(y) and finally compute\n\u27e8 O_x(y)^\u03d5\u27e9 for the given |\u03d5\u27e9.  An\nefficient way of measuring the expectation value of any Pauli observable is\ndescribed in Reference\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Experimental weak measurement of \u03c3_1z \n\n\nAs an illustration, we experimentally obtained various relevant quantities (as\ndescribed in Section\u00a0<ref>) for the two-qubit Pauli operator\n\u03c3_z\u2297 I_2 \u00d7 2 = \u03c3_1z. The weak measurement of\n\u03c3_1z allows us to measure all the diagonal elements of the density\nmatrix in a single experiment.  We experimentally implemented the proposed\nscheme and measured \u27e8 O_x(y)^\u03d5\u27e9 and A_w^\u03d5\u03a0_\u03c8^\u03d5 with varying weak interaction strength g for the case of A\n= P_k = \u03c3_1z, with the initial state |\u03c8\u27e9 = | 00\n\u27e9 and |\u03d5\u27e9 being the computational basis vectors.  All\nthe NMR spectrums in Fig.<ref>(a) correspond to measurements on the F_3 qubit. The bottom spectrum in blue represents the thermal equilibrium\nspectrum obtained by applying a readout pulse on thermal state  followed by\ndetection on the F_3 qubit. As shown in Table.<ref>, the first peak\n(from the left) in the thermal spectrum corresponds to \u27e8 O_x(y)^10\u27e9, while the second, third and fourth  peaks correspond to \u27e8\nO_x(y)^00\u27e9, \u27e8 O_x(y)^11\u27e9 and \u27e8\nO_x(y)^01\u27e9, respectively. \n\nThe reference spectrum depicted in red is obtained by applying a readout pulse\non an experimentally prepared pseudo pure state (PPS) using the spatial\naveraging technique<cit.> followed by\ndetection on the F_3 qubit.  The value of the reference peak is set to be\n1. With respect to this reference, the observable \u27e8 O_x^\u03d5\u27e9\ncan be directly measured by computing spectral intensity by integrating the area\nunder the corresponding peak, while the observable \u27e8 O_y^\u03d5\u27e9 can be measured by first performing a 90^\u2218 phase shift and then\ncomputing the intensity. Note that the quantity \u27e8 O_y^\u03d5\u27e9\nis (-1) times the spectral intensity. \n\nFor example, the third spectrum (depicted in green) in Fig.<ref>(a)\ncorresponds to g = 0.1 The peak intensity with respect to reference spectrum\nturns out to be 0.1821 \u00b1 0.003 which gives \u27e8 O_y^00\u27e9 =\n-0.1821 \u00b1 0.003 while the experimental value of \u27e8 O_x^00\u27e9\n(intensity before 90^\u2218 phase shift) turns out to be 0.0272 \u00b1 0.0066.\nSimilarly, the other four spectra in Fig.<ref>(a) correspond to various\ng values.  One can see that from Fig.<ref>(a), the for all values of\ng the spectral intensity of the first, third and fourth peak corresponding to\nthe post-selected states | 10 \u27e9, | 11 \u27e9 and | 01\n\u27e9, respectively, is negligible as compared to the reference peak which\nimplies that the quantities \u27e8 O_x(y)^10\u27e9, \u27e8\nO_x(y)^11\u27e9 and \u27e8 O_x(y)^01\u27e9 are almost zero.\nThis is to be expected since theoretically \u27e8\u03d5|\u03c3_1z|\u03c1|\u03d5\u27e9 = 0 except for |\u03d5\u27e9 = | 00 \u27e9, whereas the spectral intensity of the second peak corresponding to \u27e8\nO_y^00\u27e9 is non-zero and increases with g. \n\nThe experimental values \u27e8 O_x(y)^00\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c3_1z\u27e9_w^00\u03a0_00^00 are compared with their theoretically\nexpected values in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b), for different values of g. Only the\nreal part of \u27e8\u03c3_1z\u27e9_w^00\u03a0_00^00, Re(\u27e8\u03c3_1z\u27e9_w^00\u03a0_00^00) = \u27e8\nO_y^00\u27e9/-2g is plotted as the imaginary part turns out to be\nalmost zero (as seen from \u27e8 O_x^00\u27e9 values).  The\nexperimental quantity \u27e8\u03c3_1z\u27e9_w^00\u03a0_00^00 was\ncalculated using Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), however it can also be computed by rescaling\nthe spectrum by the factor |1/2g| with respect to the\nreference spectrum. The expected value of \u27e8\u03c3_1z\u27e9_w^00\u03a0_00^00 is equal to 1, which is the density matrix element \u03c1_11 of\ninitial state |\u03c8\u27e9 = | 00 \u27e9. \n\nAs the value of g increases, the experimental and theoretical value of\n\u03c1_11 deviates more and more from 1, because the weak interaction\napproximation no longer holds for relatively large values of g. At g = 0.05,\nthe experimental value of \u03c1_11^ exp was (0.9198 \u00b1 0.0057) + i\n(0.0525 \u00b1 0.0399), while at g = 0.5 the value of \u03c1_11^ exp was\n(0.7971 \u00b1 0.0021) + i (0.0989 \u00b1 0.0439).  We also would like to point out\nhere that in real experiments an arbitrary small value of g may not work,\nsince the signal strength after the weak interaction may be too small to detect\nand may introduce large errors in the measurements.\n\nWe also implemented the weak measurement-based scheme for different initial\nstates.  The results shown in Fig.<ref> were obtained by experimental\nimplementing the weak measurement-based scheme for a fixed interaction strength\ng = 0.1 and for different initial states of the form |\u03c8\u27e9 =\ncos(n \u03c0/20)| 00 \u27e9 + sin(n \u03c0/20)| 10\n\u27e9.  The  NMR spectrum in blue color in Fig.<ref>(a), is the\nreference spectrum, while the other two spectra in red and green correspond to\nthe states n = 0 and n = 10, respectively, which were obtained by\nimplementing the weak measurement quantum circuit (Fig.<ref>) followed by a\n90^\u2218 phase shift. Note that since the value of g is fixed, the spectra\ncorresponding to all n are rescaled by the factor 1/2(0.1) = 5 with\nrespect to the reference spectrum, which directly yields Re( \u27e8\u03c3_1z\u27e9_w^\u03d5\u03a0_\u03c8^\u03d5 ) and Im(\u27e8\u03c3_1z\u27e9_w^\u03d5\u03a0_\u03c8^\u03d5 ) (the real and imaginary parts\nof corresponding density matrix, respectively).  For n = 0 (red spectrum), the\nobservables \u27e8 O_y^10\u27e9, \u27e8 O_y^00\u27e9, \u27e8\nO_y^11\u27e9 and \u27e8 O_y^01\u27e9 turned out to be -0.1370\n\u00b1 0.0008, -0.9137 \u00b1 0.0038, -0.0267 \u00b1 0.0010 and -0.1243 \u00b1\n0.0085, respectively.  For n = 10 (green spectrum) the observables turned out\nto be 0.8687 \u00b1 0.0054, 0.1255 \u00b1 0.0033, 0.0294 \u00b1 0.0003 and 0.0237\n\u00b1 0.0030, respectively. \nThe experimentally obtained\nRe\u27e8\u03c3_1z_w^\u03d5\u03a0_\u03c8^\u03d5\u27e9 \nis compared\nwith the theoretically \nexpected values \nin Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b), \nfor |\u03d5\u27e9 = | 00 \u27e9 and |\u03d5\u27e9 = | 10 \u27e9 and for various initial states.  \nThe experimental values are in very good \nagreement with the theoretical predictions in both\nFigs.<ref> and <ref>, which clearly shows the successful\nimplementation of the weak measurement of \u03c3_1z. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Experimental DQST and DQPT using weak measurements\n\n\nWe now proceed to experimentally demonstrate element-wise full reconstruction of\nthe density and process matrices of several states and quantum gates using the\nproposed weak measurement-based DQST and DQPT schemes.  To estimate a desired\nelement \u03c1_mn of the density matrix or \u03c7_mn of \nthe process matrix, one of\nthe possible choices of the post-selected state |\u03d5\u27e9, together\nwith the Pauli operator P_k, is depicted as (|\u03d5\u27e9, P_k) \nin the matrix:\n\n    [     (| 00 \u27e9, \u03c3_1z)     (| 01 \u27e9, \u03c3_2x)     (| 10 \u27e9, \u03c3_1x) (| 11 \u27e9, \u03c3_1x\u03c3_2x);             \u03c1_12^*     (| 01 \u27e9, \u03c3_1z) (| 10 \u27e9, \u03c3_1x\u03c3_2x)     (| 11 \u27e9, \u03c3_1x);             \u03c1_13^*             \u03c1_23^*    -(| 10 \u27e9, \u03c3_1z)     (| 11 \u27e9, \u03c3_2x);             \u03c1_14^*             \u03c1_24^*             \u03c1_34^*    -(| 11 \u27e9, \u03c3_1z);                    ]\n\nIn this case, the full QST of a two-qubit quantum state requires weak\nmeasurements of only four Pauli operators: {\u03c3_1z, \u03c3_1x,\n\u03c3_2x, \u03c3_1x\u03c3_2x}.  The weak measurement of\n\u03c3_1z allows us to directly estimate all the diagonal elements\nrepresenting the populations of the energy eigenstates, while the weak\nmeasurements of \u03c3_1x, \u03c3_2x and \u03c3_1x\u03c3_2x yield\ntwo off-diagonal elements, each representing a single- and a multiple-quantum\ncoherence.\n\nAs  an illustration, we experimentally performed DQST of the maximally entangled\nBell states: |\u03c8_1 \u27e9 = (| 00 \u27e9 + | 11\n\u27e9)/\u221a(2) and |\u03c8_2 \u27e9 = (| 01 \u27e9 + | 10\n\u27e9)/\u221a(2) as well as DQPT of two quantum gates:  the Hadamard gate H\nand a rotation gate R_x(\u03c0/2).  For both DQST and DQPT, the value of\ng is set to be 0.2. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe NMR readouts demonstrating the DQST of the Bell state |\u03c8_1 \u27e9\n= (| 00 \u27e9 + | 11 \u27e9)/\u221a(2) are shown in\nFig.\u00a0<ref>, where weak measurements of four Pauli operators were\ncarried out. The NMR readouts corresponding to the weak measurement of\n\u03c3_1z, \u03c3_2x, \u03c3_1x and \u03c3_1x\u03c3_2x are\ndepicted in red, green, purple and blue respectively, while the spectrum in\nblack represents the reference spectrum.  It can be clearly seen that the\nnon-zero spectral intensities of the NMR peaks corresponding to (| 00\n\u27e9, \u03c3_1z), (| 11 \u27e9, \u03c3_1z), (| 11 \u27e9,\n\u03c3_1x\u03c3_2x) yield the three density matrix elements \u03c1_11,\n\u03c1_44 and \u03c1_14 respectively, whereas other peak intensities\n(Eq.\u00a0(<ref>)) tend to zero as compared to the reference spectrum. The\nexperimentally obtained real and imaginary parts of the density matrix\ncorresponding to the Bell state |\u03c8_1 \u27e9 are given in\nEqs.\u00a0(<ref>)-(<ref>), respectively. All the elements were\nmeasured with considerably high accuracy and precision. \n\n\nIt is to be noted that the experimental density matrix is Hermitian by\nconstruction (the imaginary part of all diagonal elements can be ignored\nand set to zero) but may not satisfy positivity and trace conditions\nas all the independent elements {\u03c1_ij, i \u2264 j } are\ncomputed individually and independently. \nFor DQST of the Bell state\n|\u03c8_1 \u27e9, the trace turns out to be 1.3435 and \nthe eigenvalues are\n1.2836, 0.2825, -0.1553 and -0.0673, which do not\ncorrespond to a valid density matrix. However, the true\nquantum state satisfying all the properties of a valid density matrix can be\nrecovered from the experimental density matrix by recasting it as a constrained\nconvex optimization problem\u00a0<cit.>:\n     min_\u03c1^true_weak                   \u2016\u03c1^true_weak-\u03c1^dqst_weak\u2016_l_2\n\n   subject to              \u03c1^true_weak \u22650,\n                                    Tr(\u03c1^true_weak) =1. \n \n\nwhere \u03c1^ true_ weak is the variable density\nmatrix\ncorresponding to the true quantum state to be reconstructed, while \u03c1^\ndqst_ weak is the experimentally obtained density matrix using the weak\nmeasurement-based DQST scheme.

The valid density matrix\n\u03c1^ true_ weak representing the true quantum state was recovered\nfrom \u03c1^ dqst_ weak  and is given in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).

All the 2^n diagonal elements can be recovered using a weak\nmeasurement of the \u03c3_1z = \u03c3_z \u2297 I^\u2297 n-1 operator,\nwhereas all the 2^n-1(2^n-1) off-diagonal elements can be obtained via weak\nmeasurements of n-qubit Pauli operators of the form { I, \u03c3_x\n}^\u2297 n (excluding I^\u2297 n), each yielding 2^n-1\nelements.  For instance, the operator \u03c3_x^\u2297 n will measure the\noff-diagonal elements {\u03c1_ij, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2^n-1, j= 2^n+1-i\n}.  The reconstruction of the full density matrix requires weak\nmeasurements of 2^n Pauli operators which is in stark contrast to standard\ntomographic protocols which require the measurement of 4^n-1 operators. Hence,\neven for full reconstruction, the weak measurement-based tomography protocol\nturns out to be much more efficient than standard and selective tomography\nprotocols.  The quantum circuit given in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a) can be extended to\nn-qubits, with DQST requiring one extra qubit as the meter qubit and DQPT\nrequiring n extra ancillary qubits along the meter qubit.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn this work\nan efficient scheme was proposed\nand  a\ngeneralized quantum circuit to perform direct QST and QPT\nusing a weak measurement-based technique was\nconstructed and the protocol was successfully\ntested  on an NMR quantum processor.  We used\nthe scalar J coupling to control the strength of the\ninteraction between the system and the metre qubits and hence\nwere able to efficiently simulate the weak measurement\nprocess with high accuracy.  Our protocol allows us to\ndirectly obtain multiple selective elements of the density\nand the process matrix of an unknown quantum state and an\nunknown quantum process in a single experiment, which makes\nit  more attractive as compared to other direct\ntomography methods.  Furthermore we employed the convex\noptimization method to recover the underlying true quantum\nstates and processes from the experimental data sets obtained\nvia the  weak measurement-based scheme  which substantially\nimproved the experimental fidelities.\n\n\nUnlike other measurement-based DQST (or DQPT) methods which\nrequire projective measurements on the system qubits and\nmaximally disturb the state of the system, our protocol does\nnot involve any  measurements on the system qubits.  Our\nexperiments open up new research directions for various\ninteresting weak measurement experiments on quantum\nensembles which were earlier not possible.\n\n\nAll experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance-III 400\nMHz FT-NMR spectrometer at the NMR Research Facility at\nIISER Mohali. \nArvind acknowledges funding from \nthe Department of Science and Technology (DST),\nIndia, under Grant No DST/ICPS/QuST/Theme-1/2019/Q-68. \nK.D. acknowledges funding from \nthe Department of Science and Technology (DST),\nIndia, under Grant No DST/ICPS/QuST/Theme-2/2019/Q-74. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\nfxundefined [1]\n ifx#1\n\nfnum [1]\n #1firstoftwo\n secondoftwo\n \nfx [1]\n #1firstoftwo\n secondoftwo\n \n\n\n\n\n\nnoop [0]secondoftwo\n\nref[1]@startlink#1@href\nhref[1]#1@endlink\nanitize@url [0]`\n12`$12`&12`#12`1\u03022`_12`%12\nstartlink[1]\nendlink[0]\n\nrl [1]href #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@bib@innerbibempty\n\n[Yokota et\u00a0al.(2009)Yokota,\n  Yamamoto, Koashi, and Imoto]yokota-njp-2009\n  author author K.\u00a0Yokota, author T.\u00a0Yamamoto,\n  author M.\u00a0Koashi,  and author N.\u00a0Imoto, 10.1088/1367-2630/11/3/033011 journal journal\n  New J.
