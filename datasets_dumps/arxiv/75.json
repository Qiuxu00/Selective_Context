For that, we introduce coordinate systems used in the Earth's vicinity, the relevant coordinate transformations, and discuss the transformations between proper  and coordinate times. Then, by treating the source as an isolated, weakly aspherical gravitating body, we represent its external gravitational field using Cartesian symmetric trace-free (STF) mass multipole moments. The light propagation  equation is solvable along the trajectory of a light ray to all STF orders \u2113. We express the STF moments via spherical harmonic coefficients of various degree and order, C_\u2113 k, S_\u2113 k. Although we focus primarily on the quadrupole (\u2113=2), octupole (\u2113=3), and hexadecapole (\u2113=4) cases, our approach is valid to all orders. The result is the gravitational phase shift expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics. These results are new, useful, and important as increasingly accurate clocks are used for many practical and scientific applications, including space-based time and frequency transfers, relativistic geodesy, and navigation.

Turyshev^1, Viktor T. Toth^2\n    March 30, 2023\n===================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe accuracy of time and frequency measurements improved significantly in the recent past. Presently, atomic frequency standards play a vital part in a growing number of technological and scientific endeavors. Atomic clocks based on microwave transitions currently define the Syst\u00e8me Internationale (the International System of Units, or SI) second and are used extensively for network synchronization and satellite-based navigation systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). Performance of the onboard clocks on global navigational satellite system (GNSS) satellites is improving.  The frequency stability of the current generation of GPS clocks is now better than 10^-14 <cit.>.\n\nOptical frequency references based on Doppler-free spectroscopy of molecular iodine are seen as a promising candidate for a future GNSS optical clock <cit.>. Compact and ruggedized setups have been developed, showing frequency instabilities at the 10^-15 level for averaging times between 1\u00a0s and 10^4\u00a0s. Optical atomic clocks have demonstrated stability of 4.8\u00d7 10^-17/\u221a(\u03c4), for an averaging time \u03c4 (in seconds). The ability to resolve frequency shifts below 10^-18 over such short timescales will affect a wide range of applications for clocks in quantum sensing and fundamental physics <cit.>.\nAs a result, future generations of GNSS will benefit from optical technologies. Especially optical clocks could provide backup or completely replace the currently used microwave clocks, potentially improving GNSS position determination thanks to their greater frequency stability. Furthermore, optical clock technologies, in combination with\noptical intersatellite links, enable new GNSS architectures, e.g., by the synchronization of distant optical frequency references within the constellation using time and frequency transfer.\n\nAs a result, future time and frequency transfer links based on the new generations of clocks will require a general relativistic description of the light propagation in the gravitational field of the extended Earth.  For practical reasons,  the description of the Earth external gravity field is given in terms of spherical harmonics. Until recently, it was sufficient to include the contribution of the gravitational mass monopole represented by the well-known Shapiro time delay. However, with the increased accuracy of modern measurements, accounting for the Earth's quadrupole moment,  J_2,  became important <cit.>. This was accomplished by treating the Earth as a rotating axisymmetric body characterized only by zonal harmonics of even order, yielding the quadrupole phase shift <cit.>.\n\nIf greater accuracy is required, accounting for the quadrupole contribution is not sufficient <cit.>. It is necessary to account for additional spherical harmonics. For some applications, in addition to J_2, the tesseral harmonics of order \u2113=2 must also be considered, along with additional low-order zonal harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field. Accurate estimates of these quantities are available to high degree and order in the form of modern models of the Earth's gravitational field. For instance, the EGM2008 Earth gravitational model is complete to degree and order 2159 <cit.>. However, due to technical reasons, a description of gravitational phase shift in terms of spherical harmonics is not available. This represents an interesting challenge that must be addressed.\n\nMotivated by this challenge, in the present paper we develop a model for proper time to coordinate time transformations and the gravitational phase shift in terms of spherical harmonics that offer the advanced representation of the Earth gravitational field.  We focus on the formulation of a relativistic model for the gravitational phase delay, accurate to 1\u00d7 10^-16 in frequency stability and 1\u00a0picosecond (ps) in time resolution. We rely on a previously developed theory of relativistic proper reference frames for a system of extended gravitating bodies and the motion of light and test particles in the vicinity of an extended body <cit.>. We use methods and tools developed for the GRAIL, GRACE-FO and ACES missions <cit.> as well as the techniques that we recently developed for treating gravitational lensing phenomena by arbitrarily shaped weakly aspherical gravitating bodes <cit.>.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Sec.\u00a0<ref> we introduce coordinate systems, coordinate transformations between various coordinates used for GPS and discuss the transformations between proper time and coordinate time. In Sec.\u00a0<ref> we discuss light propagation in the vicinity of the extended Earth and derive a general relativistic solution for the phase of an EM wave. For that we represent the Earth's external gravitational field using as set of Cartesian symmetric trace-free (STF) mass multipole moments T^a_1...a_\u2113 of various orders \u2113. In Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we study the phase shift introduced by the lowest-order multipole moments, including quadrupole (\u2113=2), octupole (\u2113=3), and hexadecapole (\u2113=4).\nWe also express the obtained results in terms of the spherical harmonics of the appropriate degree and order, C_\u2113 k, S_\u2113 k.  We conclude with a set of recommendations and an outlook in Sec.\u00a0<ref>.\n\nFor convenience, we put some additional details in appendices: In Appendix\u00a0<ref> we discuss the correspondence between the STF mass moments, T^<ab>,  and spherical harmonics, {C_2k,S_2k}, and present a practical way to establish the correspondence between them. In Appendix\u00a0<ref>, we compute useful relations for deriving contributions from low STF mass moments, including quadrupole, octupole, and hexadecapole. Finally, in Appendix\u00a0<ref>, we derive gravitational phase shift for the same orders, but in the specific case of an axisymmetric gravitational field.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 COORDINATE SYSTEMS AND PROPER-TO-COORDINATE TIME TRANSFORMATIONS\n\n\n\nGPS relies on three standard coordinate systems: the GCRS, which is centered at the Earth's center of mass and is used to track orbits in the vicinity of the Earth; the Topocentric Coordinate Reference System (TCRS), which is used to provide the positions of objects on the surface of the Earth, such as DSN ground stations; and the Satellite Coordinate Reference System (SCRS), which is needed for proper-to-coordinate time transformations. Definition and properties of TCRS together with useful details on relativistic time-keeping in the solar system are given in <cit.>. The SCRS was discussed in <cit.> in the context of the GRAIL mission. Here we investigate a need for an update for the standard general relativistic models for spacetime coordinates and equations of motion <cit.>.\n\nWe begin our discussion by describing the Geocentric Coordinate Reference System (GCRS), the reference system in which the gravitational field of the Earth is presented using measured spherical harmonic coefficients.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Geocentric Coordinate Reference System\n\n\n\nIn the vicinity of the Earth, we utilize the standard non-rotating coordinate system known as the Geocentric Coordinate Reference System (GCRS). Centered at the Earth's center of mass, the GCRS is used to track orbits in the vicinity of the Earth <cit.>. It is also called the Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinate system <cit.>. We denote the coordinates in this reference frame as {x^m_ E}\u2261(x^0=ct, x\u20d7) and present the metric tensor g^ E_mn in the following form[The notational conventions employed in this paper are those used in <cit.>. Letters from the second half of the Latin alphabet, m, n,...=0...3 denote spacetime indices. Greek letters \u03b1, \u03b2,...=1...3 denote spatial indices. The metric \u03b3_mn is that of Minkowski spacetime with \u03b3_mn= diag(+1,-1,-1,-1) in the Cartesian representation. We employ the Einstein summation convention with indices being lowered or raised using \u03b3_mn. We use powers of G and negative powers of c as bookkeeping devices for order terms. Other notations are explained as they occur.]:\n\n\n    g^ E_00   =    1-2/c^2w_ E+2/c^4w^2_ E+O(c^-6),   \n    g^ E_0\u03b1= -\u03b3_\u03b1\u03bb4/c^3w^\u03bb_ E+O(c^-5),  \n    g^ E_\u03b1\u03b2= \u03b3_\u03b1\u03b2+\u03b3_\u03b1\u03b22/c^2 w_ E+O(c^-4),\n\nwhere the scalar gravitational potential w_ E is formed as a linear superposition of the gravitational potential U_ E of the isolated Earth and the tidal potential u^ tidal_ E produced by all the solar system bodies (excluding the Earth itself), evaluated at the origin of the GCRS:\n\n    w_ E(x\u20d7)   =   U_ E(x\u20d7)+ u^ tidal_ E(x\u20d7)+ O(c^-3).\n\n\nThe Earth's gravitational potential is well known and determined by the relativistic mass density inside the Earth, \u03c3(t,x\u20d7') (see discussion in <cit.>). With  G being the universal gravitational constant this potential has the form\n\n\n    U_ E(x\u20d7)   =   G\u222b\u03c3(t,x\u20d7')d^3x'/|x\u20d7-x\u20d7'|+ O(c^-4).\n\n\nOutside the Earth (r>R_\u2295), the planet's gravitational potential U_ E may be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics. In this case, at a particular location with spherical coordinates (r\u2261|x\u20d7|,\u03d5,\u03b8) (where \u03d5 is the longitude and \u03b8 is the colatitude, which is 0 at the pole and \u03c0/2 at the equator) the Earth's potential U_ E in (<ref>) is given as\n\n\n    U_ E(x\u20d7)   =   GM_\u2295/r{1+\u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e\u2211_k=0^+\u2113(R_\u2295/r)^\u2113 P_\u2113 k(cos\u03b8)(C_\u2113 kcos k\u03c8+S_\u2113 ksin k\u03c8)}=\n       =   GM_\u2295/r_{1-\u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e(R_\u2295/r_)^\u2113 J_\u2113 P_\u21130(cos\u03b8)+\u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e\u2211_k=1^+\u2113(R_\u2295/r)^\u2113 P_\u2113 k(cos\u03b8)(C_\u2113 kcos k\u03c8+S_\u2113 ksin k\u03c8)},\n\nwhere M_\u2295 and R_\u2295 are the Earth's mass and equatorial radius, respectively, while P_\u2113 k are the associated Legendre-polynomials <cit.>. The values C_\u2113 k and S_\u2113 k are the spherical harmonic coefficients that characterize contributions of the gravitational field of the Earth beyond the monopole potential. Of these, J_\u2113=-C_\u2113 0 are the zonal harmonic coefficients. Largest among these is J_2=1.082635854\u00d7 10^-3, with all other spherical harmonic coefficients at least a factor of \u223c10^3 times smaller <cit.> (see Table\u00a0<ref> for details).\n\n\n\nInsofar as the tidal potential u^ tidal_ E is concerned, for GPS observables it is sufficient to keep only its Newtonian contribution (primarily due to the Sun and the Moon) which can be given as usual:\n\n\n    u^ tidal_ E(x\u20d7)   =   \u2211_b\u2260 E(U_b(r\u20d7^_b E+x\u20d7)-U_b(r\u20d7^_b E) - x\u20d7\u00b7\u2207\u20d7 U_b (r\u20d7^_b E))\u2243\u2211_b\u2260 EGM_b/2r^3_b E(3(n\u20d7^_b E\u00b7x\u20d7)^2-x\u20d7^2)+\n     O(r^-4_b E,c^-2),\n\nwhere U_b is the Newtonian gravitational potential of body b, r\u20d7_b E is the vector connecting the center of mass of body b with that of the Earth, and \u2207\u20d7U_b denotes the gradient of the potential. We present only the largest term in the tidal potential, which is of O(r^-3_b E); however, using the explicit form of this potential on the left side of  Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), one can easily evaluate this expression to any order needed to solve a particular problem.\n\nFinally, the contribution of the Earth's rotation is captured by the vector harmonic  potential, w^\u03b1_ E, defined as:\n\n\n    w^\u03b1_ E(x\u20d7)\n       =   G\u222b\u03c3^\u03b1(t,x\u20d7')d^3x'/|x\u20d7-x\u20d7'|+ O(c^-2)=-GM_ E/2r^3[x\u20d7\u00d7S\u20d7_\u2295]^\u03b1+ O(r^-4, c^-2),\n\nwhere \u03c3^\u03b1(t,x\u20d7') is the relativistic current density of the matter distribution inside the rotating Earth. Also, in (<ref>) we explicitly account only for the largest rotational moment,  S\u20d7_\u2295, which is the Earth's spin moment (angular momentum per unit of mass),  S\u20d7_\u2295\u2243 9.8\u00d7 10^8\u00a0 m^2/s. Contributions of other vector harmonics due to the rotating Earth are negligible (however, if needed, they may be easily incorporated using the approach developed in this paper).\n\nThe metric tensor (<ref>) with the gravitational potentials (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) represents spacetime in the GCRS, which we choose to formulate the relativistic model for timing and frequency observables. Further technical details on the  formulation of the GCRS are in <cit.>.\n\nRefs.\u00a0<cit.>, show that the proper time, \u03c4, read by a clock in harmonic coordinates of the SCRS denoted here  by {y^m}={cy^0, y\u20d7}, and coordinates of GCRS {x^m}={ct, x\u20d7}, to sufficient accuracy, are  given by\n\n\n    d\u03c4/dt   =    1-c^-2[1/2v\u20d7^2+\n    U_ E+u^ tidal_ E]+ O(c^-4),\n\nwhere v\u20d7 is the velocity of the transmitter (or receiver) in GCRS and U_ E is the Newtonian gravitational potential of the Earth (<ref>), evaluated at that location. Contribution of the tidal potential, u^ tidal_ E, varies depending on the distance from the Earth; it reaches the value above \u223c 1.71\u00d7 10^-15 for geostationary orbits. The c^-4 terms in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) are of O(v^4/c^4)\u2243 10^-19 and are negligible for our purposes. For a complete post-Newtonian form of these transformations, including c^-4 terms, and their explicit derivation, consult Ref.\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nThe numerical applications made in here concern time and frequency transfer from between a GPS (designated here by `A') and LEO (designated here by `B') spacecraft orbiting the Earth at the altitudes h_ GPS = 20,200\u00a0km and h_ LEO = 200\u00a0km to a ground station located at `C'.  As mentioned earlier, we consider  experimental uncertainties 1 \u00d7 10^-16 for frequency transfer and  at the level of 1\u00a0ps for time transfer.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Topocentric Coordinate Reference System (TCRS): proper and coordinate times\n\n\n\nFirst, we consider a ground-based receiver located at GCRS coordinates\n{x^m_C}\u2261(cx^0_ C,x\u20d7_ C).\nThe proper time \u03c4_ C, kept by a clock located at the GCRS coordinate position R\u20d7_ C(t), and moving with the coordinate velocity v\u20d7_ C = dx\u20d7_ C/dt=[\u03c9^_ E\u00d7R\u20d7_ C], where \u03c9_ E is the angular rotational velocity of the Earth at C, is determined by\n\n\n    d\u03c4_ C/dt= 1-1/c^2[1/2v\u20d7_ C^2+U_ E(x\u20d7_ C)+ \u2211_b\u2260 EGM_b/2r^3_b E(3(n\u20d7_b E\u00b7x\u20d7_ C)^2-x\u20d7_ C^2)]+ O(x^3_ C,c^-4),\n\nwhere n\u20d7_b E is a unit spatial vector in the body-Earth direction, i.e., n\u20d7_b E=r\u20d7_b E/|r\u20d7_b E|, where r\u20d7_b E is the vector connecting body b with the Earth.\n\nThe first two terms in (<ref>) are due to the  geocentric velocity of a ground station and the Newtonian potential at its location.\nAssuming a uniform diurnal rotation of the Earth, so that 1/2v\u20d7_ C^2=1/2\u03c9_\u2295^2 R^2_ C(\u03b8)sin^2\u03b8, we evaluate the magnitudes of the largest contributions produced by these terms, evaluated at the Earth's equator R_ C(\u03c0/2)=R_\u2295:\n\n\n    c^-21/2v\u20d7_ C^2   =   1/2c^2\u03c9_\u2295^2 R^2_\u2295\u2272\n    1.20 \u00d7 10^-12,\n        \n    c^-2U_ E = 1/c^2GM_\u2295/R_\u2295\u2272\n    6.95 \u00d7 10^-10.\n\nThus, both of these terms are very large and must be kept in the model. In addition, as we will see below, one would have to account for several terms in the spherical harmonics expansion of the Earth gravity potential.\n\nThe last term within the square brackets in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is the sum of the Newtonian tides due to other bodies (mainly the Sun and the Moon) at the clock location x\u20d7_ C. These terms are small for the ground station, being of order\n\n\n    c^-2u^ tidal_ E\u2299   \u2243   GM_\u2299 R_\u2295^2/2  AU^3c^2(3(n\u20d7_\u2299 E\u00b7n\u20d7_ C)^2-1)\u2272\n    1.79 \u00d7 10^-17,\n    \n    \n    c^-2u^ tidal_ E   \u2243   Gm_ R_\u2295^2/2 r^3_ -1pt  Ec^2(3(n\u20d7_ -1pt  E\u00b7n\u20d7_ C)^2-1)\u2272\n    4.90 \u00d7 10^-17,\n\nwhere for the Moon we used its distance from the Earth at the perigee[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance_(astronomy)>] of r_ -1pt  E=356,500\u00a0km.\nThus, both largest tidal contributions are currently negligible as far as the  definition of the TCRS for GPS is concerned.\n\nTherefore, at the accuracy required for GPS, it is sufficient to keep only the first two terms in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) when defining the relationship between the proper time \u03c4_ C and the coordinate time TCG=t (Temps-coordonn\u00e9e g\u00e9ocentrique). In other words, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) yields the differential equation that relates the rate of the proper \u03c4_ C time, as measured by an receiver's clock on the surface of the Earth, so that 1/2v\u20d7_ C^2=1/2\u03c9_\u2295^2 R^2_ C(\u03b8)sin^2\u03b8, to the time in GCRS, t.\n\n    d\u03c4_ C/dt = 1 -1/c^2[\n    1/2v\u20d7_ C^2\n    + U_ E(x\u20d7_ C)]+ O(c^-4).\n\nAt the level of accuracy required for GPS, it is important to account in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) for the oblateness (nonsphericity) of the Earth's Newtonian potential, which is given in the form of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). In fact, when we model the Earth's gravity potential, we need to take into account quadrupole and higher moments, time-dependent terms due to tides, as well as the tidal displacement of the ground-based receiver. Substituting in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) potential U_ E from (<ref>), evaluated at the Earth's equator r=R_ C(\u03c0/2)=R_\u2295, we have:\n\n\n    d\u03c4_ C/dt   =   \n    1-1/c^2[1/2\u03c9_\u2295^2 R^2_\u2295+\n    GM_\u2295/R_\u2295(1-\u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e J_\u2113 P_\u21130(0)+\u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e\u2211_k=1^+\u2113P_\u2113 k(0)(C_\u2113 kcos k\u03d5+S_\u2113 ksin k\u03d5))\n    ].\n\n\nThe largest contribution to d\u03c4_ C/dt, of course, comes from the velocity and mass monopole terms, which are estimated to produce an effect of the order of c^-2(1/2\u03c9_\u2295^2 R^2_\u2295+G M_\u2295/R_\u2295)\u223c 6.97\u00d7 10^-10. The quadrupole term produces a contribution of the order of c^-2G M_\u2295 J_2/(2R_\u2295)\u223c 3.76\u00d7 10^-13.\nContributions of other zonal harmonics ranging from -c^-23G M_\u2295 J_4/(8R_\u2295)\u223c 4.22\u00d7 10^-16 (from J_4) to c^-25G M_\u2295 J_6/(16R_\u2295)\u223c 1.04\u00d7 10^-16 (from J_6) and to c^-235G M_\u2295 J_8/(128R_\u2295)\u223c 1.01\u00d7 10^-16 (from J_8).\n\nWe also need to include contributions from the leading \u2113=2 coefficients C_22 and S_22, which are of order c^-2(G M_\u2295 /R_\u2295)P_22(0)C_22cos 2\u03d5\u223c 3.28\u00d7 10^-15cos 2\u03d5 and c^-2(G M_\u2295 /R_\u2295)P_22(0)S_22sin 2\u03d5\u223c 1.89\u00d7 10^-15cos 2\u03d5. Some of the low-order tesseral harmonics, C_\u2113 k and S_\u2113 k, are also responsible for the terms of the order of \u223c10^-16, and thus, they should also  be included, up to at least \u2113=8.\nAlthough individual contributions of these and other terms are quite small, their cumulative effect may be noticeable even at the level of up to 1\u00d7 10^-15. (This is especially important for the ACES mission on the ISS, which will operate clocks accurate to 1\u00d7 10^-16 in low Earth's orbit with altitude of \u223c400 km.) However, the constant rate is typically absorbed for each clock during its  synchronization with the network of clocks, leaving only periodic terms, which are uncertain at the level of \u223c10^-17. Therefore, keeping only the leading terms, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) takes the form:\n\n\n    d\u03c4_ C/dt=\n    1-1/c^2[1/2\u03c9_\u2295^2 R^2_\u2295   +   GM_\u2295/R_\u2295(1+1/2J_2-3/8J_4+5/16J_6-35/128J_8+P_22(0)(C_22cos 2\u03d5+S_22sin 2\u03d5)+\n       +   \u2211_\u2113=3^8\u2211_k=1^+\u2113P_\u2113 k(0)(C_\u2113 kcos k\u03d5+S_\u2113 ksin k\u03d5))\n    ]+ O(5.83\u00d7 10^-17),\n\nwhere the error bound is set by the contribution from J_10 and some of the low-order tesseral harmonics. Keeping only the \u2113=2 terms, this expression can be truncated to\n\n\n    d\u03c4_ C/dt   =   \n    1-1/c^2[1/2\u03c9_\u2295^2 R^2_\u2295+\n    GM_\u2295/R_\u2295(1+1/2J_2+3(C_22cos 2\u03d5+S_22sin 2\u03d5))\n    ]+ O(2.28\u00d7 10^-15cos\u03d5),\n\nwhere the error bound is set by the contribution from C_31 coefficient (see Table\u00a0<ref>).\n\nIn the past, clock synchronization relied on a definition of Earth's geoid. In this case, for a clock situated on the surface of the Earth, the relativistic correction term appearing in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is given at the needed precision by\n\n\n    v\u20d7^2_ C/2 + U_ E(x\u20d7_ C)= W_0-\u222b_0^h_ C -7pt g dh,\n\nwhere W_0 = 6.2636856\u00d7 10^7 m^2/s^2 is the Earth's potential at the reference geoid while g denotes the Earth's acceleration (gravitational plus centrifugal), and where h_ C is the clock's altitude above the reference geoid. However, as we mention above, this definition of terrestrial time is problematic when considering accuracies below 10^-17 because of the uncertainties in the realization of the geoid at this level.\n\nIn practice, time measurements are based on averages of clock and frequency measurements on the Earth surface <cit.>. Therefore it was decided to dissociate the definition of TT from the geoid while maintaining continuity with the previous definition. For this purpose, the time coordinate called Terrestrial Time (TT) is defined. TT is related to TCG=t linearly by definition:\n\n    dt_ TT/dt=1-L_ G.\n\nIAU Resolution B1.9 (2000) turned L_G into a defining constant with its value fixed to L_ G=6.969290134\u00d7 10^-10.\n\nThis definition accounts for the secular term due to the Earth's potential when converting between TCG and the time measured by an idealized clock on the Earth geoid <cit.>. Using Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), we also have\n\n\n    d\u03c4_ C/dt_ TT=d\u03c4_ C/dtdt/dt_ TT=1+L_ G-1/c^2[1/2v\u20d7^2_ C\n    + U_ E(x\u20d7_ C)]+ O(c^-4).\n\nClearly, if the target clock synchronization is of the order of  \u223c 10^-15, the definition (<ref>) is rather clean with just a few terms given by (<ref>). This expression quickly becomes rather messy if a more precise synchronization is desired.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Satellite Coordinate Reference System (SCRS)\n\n\n\nWe can also determine the differential equation that relates the rate of the spacecraft proper \u03c4_ A time, as measured by an on-board clock in Earth orbit with GCRS coordinates {y^m_ A}={cy^0_ A, y\u20d7_ A}, to the time in GCRS, TCG=t. Substituting in (<ref>) potential U_ E from (<ref>) and largest term for the tidael potential u^ tidal_ E from (<ref>), we have:\n\n\n    d\u03c4_ A/dt=\n    1-1/c^2[1/2v\u20d7^2_ A   +   GM_ E/r_ A(1-\u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e(R_ E/r_ A)^\u2113 J_\u2113 P_\u21130(cos\u03b8) + \u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e\u2211_k=1^+\u2113(R_ E/r_ A)^\u2113 P_\u2113 k(cos\u03b8)(C_\u2113 kcos k\u03d5+S_\u2113 ksin k\u03d5))+\n       +   \u2211_b\u2260 EGM_b/2r^3_b E(3(n\u20d7_b E\u00b7y\u20d7_ A)^2-y\u20d7_ A^2)]+ O(y^3_ A,c^-4).\n\nWe will evaluate the magnitude of the terms in this equations for two different orbits - LEO with altitude 200 km and GPS with altitude 20,200 km. We will keep in mind the anticipated frequency stability of \u0394 f/f= 1\u00d7 10^-15. We will use these numbers to evaluate the terms in (<ref>).\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 LEO clock: proper-to-coordinate time transformation\n\n\nIn the case of the LEO orbit with altitude of h_A=200\u00a0km, the largest contribution to (d\u03c4_ A/dt)_ LEO, of course, comes from the velocity and mass monopole terms, which are estimated to produce an effect of the order of c^-2(1/2v\u20d7^2_ A+G M_ E/(R_\u2295 +h_ LEO)=c^-23G M_ E/2(R_\u2295 +h_ LEO)\u223c 1.01\u00d7 10^-9. Because of the larger contribution, this term is 1.45 times larger than for a receiver on the ground (see estimated presented above, just after Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).)\n\nFor the chosen LEO orbit, the quadrupole term produces contribution of the order of\n\n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^2/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^3J_2P_20(cos\u03b8)\u2272 6.86\u00d7 10^-13,\n\nwhich is large enough to be included in the model.\nContributions of other zonal harmonics are estimated as\n\n\n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^3/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^4J_3 P_30(cos\u03b8)\u2272 1.56\u00d7 10^-15, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^4/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^5J_4P_40(cos\u03b8)\u2272 9.65\u00d7 10^-16, \n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^5/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^6J_5 P_50(cos\u03b8)\u2272 1.21\u00d7 10^-16, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^6/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^7J_6P_40(cos\u03b8)\u2272 3.03\u00d7 10^-16,\n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^7/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^8J_7 P_70(cos\u03b8)\u2272 2.71\u00d7 10^-16, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^8/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^9J_8P_80(cos\u03b8)\u2272 1.51\u00d7 10^-16,\n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^9/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^10J_9 P_90(cos\u03b8)\u2272 8.04\u00d7 10^-17, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^10/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^11J_10P_10 0(cos\u03b8)\u2272 2.28\u00d7 10^-16.\n\nNote that to develop the estimates above we used approximated P_\u21130 by their largest value at \u03b8=0. In reality, these polynomials rarely take that value and thus P_\u21130 are much less than 1. On the other hand, although the contributions from J_7,J_8,J_9,J_10 are all on the order of 1 to 2 parts in 10^-16, their cumulative effect may exceed the threshold of 10^-16. Nevertheless, we recommend keeping only the contributions from J_2,J_3 and J_4.\n\nThe situation with tesseral harmonics is a bit more complicated as many of them produce contributions on the order of a few parts in 10^-16. The largest among these are those due to C_22 and S_22:\n\n\n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^2/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^3P_22(cos\u03b8){C_22cos 2\u03d5,\u00a0S_22sin 2\u03d5}   \u2272   {9.98\u00d7 10^-16cos 2\u03d5,  \u00a05.73\u00d7 10^-16sin 2\u03d5}.\n\n\nThe contributions from the terms of \u2113=3 are\n\n\n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^3/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^4P_31(cos\u03b8){C_31cos\u03d5, \u00a0\n    S_31sin\u03d5}   \u2272   {1.35\u00d7 10^-15cos\u03d5, \u00a0 1.65\u00d7 10^-16sin\u03d5}, \n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^3/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^4P_32(cos\u03b8){C_32cos 2\u03d5,\u00a0\n    S_32sin 2\u03d5}   \u2272   {1.90\u00d7 10^-16cos2 \u03d5, \u00a0 1.30\u00d7 10^-16sin 2\u03d5}, \n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^3/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^4P_33(cos\u03b8){C_33cos 3\u03d5,\u00a0S_33sin 3\u03d5}   \u2272   {6.10\u00d7 10^-17cos 3\u03d5, \u00a0 1.21\u00d7 10^-16sin 3\u03d5}.\n\n\nThe contributions from the terms of \u2113=4 are\n\n\n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^4/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^5P_41(cos\u03b8){C_41cos\u03d5,\u00a0S_41sin\u03d5}   \u2272   {3.03\u00d7 10^-16cos\u03d5, \u00a0 2.67\u00d7 10^-16sin\u03d5}, \n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^4/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^5P_42(cos\u03b8){C_42cos 2\u03d5, \u00a0S_42sin 2\u03d5}   \u2272   {4.66\u00d7 10^-17cos2 \u03d5, \u00a0 8.82\u00d7 10^-17sin 2\u03d5}, \n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^4/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^5P_43(cos\u03b8){C_43cos 3\u03d5,\u00a0 S_43sin 3\u03d5}   \u2272   {3.53\u00d7 10^-17cos 3\u03d5, \u00a0 7.16\u00d7 10^-18sin 3\u03d5}, \n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^4/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^5P_44(cos\u03b8){C_44cos 4\u03d5,\u00a0S_44sin 4\u03d5}   \u2272   {2.37\u00d7 10^-18cos 4\u03d5, \u00a0 3.88\u00d7 10^-18sin 4\u03d5}.\n\n\nAlthough their individual contributions are quite small, the cumulative effect of these terms may easily reach the level of \u03f5_ LEO0\u2248 1.33\u00d7 10^-15. The constant rate \u03f5_ LEO0 would likely be absorbed in other terms during clock synchronization. What is important is the variability in  the entire error term \u03f5_ LEO(t)=\u03f5_ LEO0+\u03b4\u03f5_ LEO(t), where the amplitude of the variable term \u03b4\u03f5_ LEO(t) is due to seasonal changes in the Earth hydrosphere, crust, etc. and is expected to be of the order of  \u03b4\u03f5_ LEO(t)\u223c 3\u00d7 10^-17, resulting in the ultimate uncertainty in d\u03c4_ A/dt at that level.\n\nThe last term within the square brackets in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is the sum of the Newtonian tides due to the Sun and the Moon at the location of a clock in an Earth orbit. For a chosen LEO orbit, these terms are small:\n\n\n    c^-2u^ tidal_ E\u2299   \u2243   GM_\u2299 (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^2/2  AU^3c^2(3(n\u20d7_\u2299 E\u00b7n\u20d7_ C)^2-1)\u2272\n    1.91 \u00d7 10^-17, \n    \n    c^-2u^ tidal_ E   \u2243   Gm_ (R_\u2295+h_ LEO)^2/2 r^3_ -1pt  Ec^2(3(n\u20d7_ -1pt  E\u00b7n\u20d7_ C)^2-1)\u2272\n    5.21 \u00d7 10^-17,\n\nand, thus, may be neglected.\n\nTherefore, for LEO in equation (<ref>) we must keep the following terms:\n\n\n    d\u03c4_ A/dt   =   \n    1-1/c^2[v\u20d7^2_ A/2+\n    GM_ E/r_ A(1-\u2211_\u2113=2^4(R_ E/r_ A)^\u2113 J_\u2113 P_\u21130(cos\u03b8)+\n    (R_ E/r_ A)^2 P_22(cos\u03b8)(C_22cos 2\u03d5+S_22sin 2\u03d5)+\n           53pt + (R_ E/r_ A)^3 P_31(cos\u03b8)(C_31cos\u03d5+S_31sin\u03d5)\n    )]+\n     O(3.03\u00d7 10^-16),\n\nwhere the size of the error term is set by J_6 and cumulative contribution of higher \u2113\u2265 3 gravitational harmonics.\n\nClearly, such a modeling accuracy is at the limit anticipated for the Deep Space Atomic Clocks (DSAC) with frequency stability at the level of 1\u00d7 10^-16 at 1 day (if DSAC is placed on a LEO). However, it is already insufficient for ESA's ACES mission on the International Space Station and DSAC, where clock accuracy is expected to be at the level of 1\u00d7 10^-16 at 1 day.  Furthermore, there are plans to fly an optical interferometer and highly-stable optical link as a part of the STE-QUEST mission <cit.> and also a Space Optical Clock (SOC) mission <cit.> with frequency stability below 1\u00d7 10^-17, for which a new and more detailed model may be required.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 GPS clock: proper-to-coordinate time transformation\n\n\nNow we consider GPS orbit with h_ GPS=22,200\u00a0km and estimate the sizes of all the terms entering (<ref>). Clearly, the largest contribution to (d\u03c4_ A/dt)_ GPS, of course, comes from the velocity and mass monopole terms, which are estimated to produce an effect of the order of\n\n\n    1/c^2(1/2v\u20d7^2_ GPS+G M_\u2295/R_\u2295+h_ GPS)=3G M_\u2295/2c^2(R_\u2295+h_ GPS)\u223c 2.50\u00d7 10^-10,\n\nor almost 4 times smaller than for LEO, but still providing a rather large contribution.\n\nThe quadrupole term produces contribution of the order of\n\n\n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^2/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^3J_2 P_20(cos\u03b8)   \u2272    1.04\u00d7 10^-14,\n\nwhich is significant. Contributions of tesseral harmonics with \u2113=2 are estimated as\n\n\n    G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^2/c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^3P_22(cos\u03b8){C_22cos 2\u03d5 ,\u00a0S_22sin 2\u03d5}   \u2272   {1.51\u00d7 10^-17cos 2\u03d5, \u00a0 8.69\u00d7 10^-18cos 2\u03d5},\n\nand are small to provide a measurable contribution.\nContributions of other zonal harmonics ranging from \u2272 5.85\u00d7 10^-18 (from J_3), to \u2272 9.08\u00d7 10^-19 (from J_4),\nto \u2272 2.79\u00d7 10^-20 (from J_5),\n to \u223c 1.72\u00d7 10^-20 (from J_6), which are clearly negligible and may be omitted.\n\nEvaluating the contribution due to Newtonian tides in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) for a GPS orbit, we find the following\n\n\n    c^-2u^ tidal_ E\u2299   \u2243   GM_\u2299 (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^2/2  AU^3c^2(3(n\u20d7_\u2299 E\u00b7n\u20d7_ C)^2-1)\u2272\n    3.11 \u00d7 10^-16,\n    \n    \n    c^-2u^ tidal_ E    \u2243   Gm_ (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^2/2 r^3_ -1pt  Ec^2(3(n\u20d7_ -1pt  E\u00b7n\u20d7_ C)^2-1)\u2272\n    8.50 \u00d7 10^-16,\n\nand, thus, these terms must be kept in any model that aims for to offer frequency stability of O(10^-16).\n\nTherefore, for the case of atomic clocks on GPS spacecraft in the (<ref>) we must keep only the quadrupole term as well as the two tidal terms:\n\n\n    d\u03c4_ A/dt   =   \n    1-1/c^2[v\u20d7^2_ A/2+\n    GM_\u2295/r_ A(1-J_2(R_ E/r_ A)^2\n    P_20(cos\u03b8))+\n    \u2211^ S, m_b\u2260 EGM_b/2r^3_b E(3(n\u20d7_b E\u00b7y\u20d7_ A)^2-y\u20d7_ A^2)]+ O(6.34\u00d7 10^-17),\n\nwhere the size of the error term is set by the magnitude of the next term in lunar tide, which is of the order of  (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)/r_ -1pt  E\u223c 0.075 times smaller compared to the first term of lunar tide <cit.>.  Also, we used a convenient notation for Legendre polynomial P_20(cos\u03b8)=(3z^2_ A-r^2_ A)/2r^2_ A.\n\nAs a result, the expression for proper to coordinate time transformation for LEO, (<ref>), and GPS, (<ref>), satellites explicitly includes the effects of the Earth's oblateness, J_2. The presence of this term in the equations of motion will lead to a perturbation of a Keplerian orbit. The effect of the quadrupole is large. Computing the perturbations to Keplerian orbital elements, we see that for the semi-major axis, r_ A=a, if the eccentricity is very small, the dominant contribution has a period twice the orbital period and has amplitude 3J_2 R^2_ Esin^2 i/(2a)\u2243 1665\u00a0m, assuming an orbital inclination of i=55^\u2218. The effect of J_2 is significant and should be modeled for satellite clocks in low Earth orbit.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Accounting for orbital perturbations due to Earth's oblateness J_2\n\n\nThe presence of the J_2 term in (<ref>) and (<ref>) may be accounted for within a perturbation theory. Perturbations of GPS orbits due to Earth's quadrupole mass distribution are a significant fraction of the change in semi-major axis associated with the corresponding orbit change. One needs to estimate the effect of Earth's quadrupole moment on\nthe orbital elements of a Keplerian orbit and thence on the change in frequency induced by an orbit change.\n\nAccounting for the perturbation in Keplerian orbital elements including the semi-major axis, a, eccentric anomaly, E= M+esin E (with M being the mean anomaly), eccentricity, e, orbital radius, r=a(1-ecos E), we can compute perturbations to each of the terms v_ A^2,  in GM_ E/r_ A and the quadrupole term in (<ref>) and (<ref>), namely those is. The corresponding calculations are lengthy, but straightforward and are well-known. Here we present only the final relevant result:\n\n\n    -v\u20d7^2_ A/2c^2   -   GM_\u2295/c^2r_ A(1-J_2[R_\u2295/r_ A]^23z^2_ A-r^2_ A/2r^2_ A)=\n       =   3GM_\u2295/2c^2a_0-2GM_\u2295/c^2a_0e_0cos E_0-\n    7GM_\u2295 R^2_\u2295 J_2/2c^2a^3_0(1-3/2sin^2 i_0)-\n    GM_\u2295 R^2_\u2295 J_2sin^2 i_0/c^2a^3_0cos2(\u03c9_0+u),\n\nwhere i_0 is the inclination, \u03c9 is the altitude of perigee and u is the true anomaly. Also, subscript ()_0 refers to an unperturbed quantity.\n\nThe first term, when combined with the reference potential at Earth's geoid, gives rise to the \u201cfactory frequency offset\u201d estimated to be 3GM_\u2295/2c^2a_0\u223c 2.50\u00d7 10^-10. The second term gives rise to the eccentricity effect. The third term is estimated to be\n\n\n    7G M_\u2295 R_\u2295^2 J_2/2c^2 (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^3(1-3/2sin^2 i_0)   \u223c    2.37\u00d7 10^-16,\n\nand at the limit of the anticpated accuracy.\nThis is for the nominal inclination of GPS orbits of i_0=55^\u2218 such that the factor (1 - 3/2sin^2 i_0)=-6.52\u00d7 10^-3. The near vanishing of this factor is pure coincidence in the GPS. The last term has an amplitude\n\n\n    GM_\u2295 R^2_\u2295 J_2sin^2 i_0/c^2a^3_0=6.98\u00d710^-15,\n\nwhich may be large enough to consider when calculating frequency shifts produced by orbit changes. Therefore, this contribution may have to be considered  in the determination of the\nsemi-major axis, but for now we neglect it.\n\nThe last periodic term in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is of a form similar to that which gives rise to the eccentricity correction, which is applied by GPS receivers. Considering only the last periodic term, the\nadditional time elapsed on the orbiting clock will be given by\n\n\n    \u0394 t_J_2=-\u222b_ pathdt[\n    GM_\u2295 R^2_\u2295 J_2sin^2 i_0/c^2a^3_0cos2(\u03c9_0+nt)],\n\nwhere to a sufficient approximation we have replaced the quantity u in the integrand by n=\u221a(GM_\u2295/a^3_0) is the approximate mean motion of GPS satellites. Integrating and dropping the constant of integration (assuming as usual that such constant time offsets are lumped with other contributions) gives the periodic relativistic effect on the elapsed time of a clock on a GPS spacecraft due to Earth's\nquadrupole moment:\n\n\n    \u0394 t_J_2=-\u221a(GM_\u2295/a^3_0)R^2_\u2295 J_2sin^2 i_0/2c^2sin2(\u03c9_0+nt).\n\nThe phase of this effect is zero when the satellite passes through Earth's equatorial plane going northwards. If not accounted for, this effect on a LEO clock time has the magnitude of \u0394 t_J_2 LEO = 1.95\u00d7 10^-10\u00a0s, giving rise to a peak-to-peak periodic navigational error in position of approximately 2c\u00d7\u0394 t_J_2 LEO = 11.67\u00a0cm. The same effect on GPS clock has the magnitude of \u0394 t_J_2 GPS = 2.40\u00d7 10^-11\u00a0s and is responsible for a peak-to-peak periodic navigational error in position of about 2c\u00d7\u0394 t_J_2 GPS = 1.44\u00a0cm. Therefore, these effects must be included in the model for high-accuracy orbit determination, especially for supporting for DSAC, ACES, STE-QUEST, and SOC missions in the near future.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Accounting for tidal perturbations due to Sun and the Moon\n\n\nAs we saw before, the tidal perturbations of the GPS orbit give rise of the sizable effects given by (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>). We observe that (n\u20d7_\u2299 E\u00b7n\u20d7_ C)=cos(\u03d5_\u2299 0+(n_\u2295 +n_ GPS)t), where n_\u2295 and n_ GPS are the orbital frequency of the Earth's sidereal motion and GPS spacecraft in orbit about Earth, correspondingly. Similarly, (n\u20d7_ -1pt  E\u00b7n\u20d7_ C)=cos(\u03d5_ -1pt 0+(n_ +n_ GPS)t), where n_ is the orbital frequency of the Moon around the Earth.\nWith these defintions, we evaluate (<ref>) as\n\n\n    c^-2u^ tidal_ E\u2299   \u2243   GM_\u2299 (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^2/4 c^2 AU^3(3cos[2\u03d5_\u2299 0+2(n_\u2295 +n_ GPS)t]+1).\n\nThe constant term here has the magnitude\n\n\n    GM_\u2299 (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^2/4 c^2 AU^3\u2243\n    7.79 \u00d7 10^-17,\n\nand may be neglected. Considering the periodic term in the expression (<ref>), the  additional time elapsed on the orbiting clock will be given by\n\n\n    \u0394 t^ tidal_\u2299   =   -\u222b_ pathdt(\n    3GM_\u2299 (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^2/4 c^2 AU^3cos[2\u03d5_\u2299 0+2(n_\u2295 +n_ GPS)t])=\n       =   -3GM_\u2299 (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^2/8 c^2 AU^3(n_\u2295 +n_ GPS)sin[\n    2\u03d5_\u2299 0+2(n_\u2295 +n_ GPS)t].\n\nIf not accounted for, this effect on a GPS clock time has the magnitude of \u0394 t^ tidal_\u2299 = 8.01\u00d7 10^-13\u00a0s, giving rise to a peak-to-peak periodic navigational error in position of approximately 2c\u00d7\u0394 t^ tidal_\u2299 = 0.48\u00a0mm, which is negligible.\n\nSimilarly, using (<ref>)  we evaluate the tidal contribution from the Moon:\n\n\n    c^-2u^ tidal_ E    \u2243   Gm_ (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^2/4c^2r^3_ -1pt  E(3cos[2\u03d5_ -1pt 0+2(n_ +n_ GPS)t]+1).\n\n\nThe constant term here has the magnitude\n\n\n    Gm_ (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^2/4c^2r^3_ -1pt  E\u2243\n    2.13 \u00d7 10^-16,\n\nand is at the anticipated frequency stability limit. Considering the periodic term in  expression (<ref>), the\nadditional time elapsed on the orbiting clock will be given by\n\n\n    \u0394 t^ tidal_   =   -\u222b_ pathdt(\n    3Gm_ (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^2/4c^2r^3_ -1pt  Ecos[2\u03d5_ -1pt 0+2(n_ +n_ GPS)t])=\n       =   -3Gm_ (R_\u2295+h_ GPS)^2/8c^2r^3_ -1pt  E(n_ +n_ GPS)sin[2\u03d5_ -1pt 0+2(n_ +n_ GPS)t].\n\nIf not accounted for, this effect on a GPS clock time has the magnitude of \u0394 t^ tidal_ = 2.14\u00d7 10^-12\u00a0s, giving rise to a peak-to-peak periodic navigational error in position of approximately 2c\u00d7\u0394 t^ tidal_= 1.29\u00a0mm, which is right at the limit of the anticipated GPS timing precision.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 GPS clock: proper-to-coordinate time transformation: recommended formulation\n\n\nAs a result of the analysis presented above, the recommended expression for the differential equation that relates the rate of the spacecraft proper \u03c4_ A time, as measured by an on-board clock on a  GPS  spacecraft  to the time in GCRS, TCG=t that was derived as  (<ref>), should have only the quadrupole term as well as the lunar tidal terms:\n\n\n    d\u03c4_ A/dt   =   \n    1-1/c^2[v\u20d7^2_ A/2+\n    GM_\u2295/r_ A(1-J_2(R_ E/r_ A)^2\n    P_20(cos\u03b8))+\n    Gm_/r^3_ -1pt  Er_ A^2 P_20(cos\u03b2_ -1pt  GPS(t))\n    ]+ O(7.78\u00d7 10^-17),\n\nwhere \u03b2_ -1pt  GPS(t)=\u2220 (n\u20d7_ -1pt  E,n\u20d7_ GPS)=\u03d5_ -1pt 0+(n_ +n_ GPS)t, and r_ A=|x\u20d7_ GPS|\u2243 R_\u2295+h_ GPS, the orbital radius of the GPS spacecraft. The size of the error term in (<ref>) is set by the magnitude of the constant term due to the solar tide (<ref>).\n\nNear the surface of the Earth, the expression beyond the monopole term is dominated by the quadrupole moment characterized by J_2. At higher orbits, however, as the effect of J_2 diminishes, contributions due to lunar tides become more significant. For spacecraft going beyond geostationary orbits, e.g., spacecraft in lunar transfer orbits carrying accurate clocks, eventually it becomes necessary to switch to a more accurate representation of the lunar gravitational field, such as the representation in <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 LIGHT PROPAGATION IN THE VICINITY OF THE EARTH \n\n\n\nKey to our understanding of the problem of EM wave propagation in the vicinity of a gravitating body is the realization that the body's gravitational field is usually presented in a body-centric reference frame. In contrast, signal propagation is best analyzed in a signal-centric reference frame.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Gravitational phase shift of an EM wave\n\n\n\nThe phase of an EM wave is a scalar function that is invariant under a set of general coordinate transformations. In the geometric optics approximation, the phase \u03c6 is found as a solution to the eikonal equation <cit.>,\n\n    g^mn\u2202_m\u03c6\u2202_n\u03c6=0,\n\nwhich is a direct consequence of Maxwell's equations. Its solution describes the wavefront of an EM wave propagating in curved spacetime. The solution's geometric properties are defined by the metric tensor g_mn, which is derived from Einstein's field equations. In the vicinity of the Earth, this tensor is given by Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>)\u2013(<ref>).\n\nTo solve Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), we introduce a covector of the electromagnetic wavefront in curved spacetime, K_m = \u2202_m\u03c6. We use \u03bb to denote an affine parameter along the trajectory of a light ray, which is orthogonal to the wavefront \u03c6. The vector K^m = dx^m/d\u03bb = g^mn\u2202_n\u03c6 is tangent to the light ray. Equation\u00a0(<ref>) states that K^m is null: g_mnK^mK^n = 0.\n\nTo find a solution of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), we expand the eikonal \u03c6 with respect to the gravitational constant G, assuming that the unperturbed solution is a plane wave. The expansion may be given as\n\n    \u03c6(t,x\u20d7) = \u03c6_0+\u222b k_m dx^m+\u03c6_G (t,x\u20d7)+ O(G^2),\n\nwhere \u03c6_0 is an integration constant and k_m = k(1, k\u20d7) is a constant (with respect to the Minkowski metric) null vector (i.e., \u03b3_mnk^mk^n=0) along the direction of propagation of the unperturbed EM plane wave. The wave direction is given by the vector k\u20d7\u2261 k^\u03f5, which is the unit vector along the ray's path, |k\u20d7|=1. Furthermore, k=\u03c9/c, where \u03c9 is the constant angular frequency of the unperturbed wave, and \u03c6_G is the perturbation of the eikonal of first order in G, which is yet to be determined. Also, as a consequence of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), the wave vector of an electromagnetic wave in curved spacetime, K^m(t,x\u20d7), admits a series expansion with respect to G in the form\n\n\n    K^m(t,x\u20d7)=dx^m/d\u03bb= g^mn\u2202_n\u03c6=k^m+k_G^m(t,x\u20d7)+ O(G^2),\n\nwhere k^m_G(t,x\u20d7)=\u03b3^mn\u2202_n\u03c6_G(t,x\u20d7) is the first order perturbation of the wave vector with respect to G.\n\nTo solve Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>) and (<ref>) for \u03c6_G in the GCRS, we first substitute (<ref>) into (<ref>).\nThen, defining h^mn=g^mn-\u03b3^mn and keeping only first order terms in G, we obtain an ordinary differential equation to determine \u03c6_G:\n\n    d\u03c6_G/d\u03bb= -1/2h^mnk_mk_n + O(G^2),\n\nwhere d\u03c6_G/d\u03bb= k_m\u2202^m\u03c6_G+ O(G^2).  (Note, that Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) alternatively can also be obtained by integrating the null geodesic equation <cit.>).\nWith g_mn given by (<ref>), the equation to determine the phase of the EM wave as it propagates in the vicinity of the Earth takes the following form:\n\n\n    d\u03c6_G/d\u03bb=\n    -k^2{2/c^2w_ E+2/c^2w^ tidal_ E+ 4/c^3(k_\u03f5 w^\u03f5_ E)+ O(G^2)}.\n\nThis equation describes the gravitational phase shift introduced by various contributions to the effective gravity field of the GCRS (<ref>) with the potentials (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>).  Below, we will integrate it along the light ray's trajectory.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Parameterizing the light ray's trajectory\n\n\n\nTo solve (<ref>), we need to present the geometry of the problem and introduce our basic notations. Following <cit.>, we represent the light ray's trajectory, correct to the Newtonian order, as\n\n\n    {x^m}\u2261(x^0=ct, \u00a0\u00a0x\u20d7(t)\u2261r\u20d7(t)=r\u20d7_ 0+k\u20d7 c(t-t_0))+ O(G),\n\nwhere k\u20d7 is a unit vector in the incident direction of the light ray's propagation path and r\u20d7_0 represents the point of emission that may be expressed as k\u20d7=(r\u20d7-r\u20d7_0)/|r\u20d7-r\u20d7_0|. Next, we define the impact parameter of the unperturbed trajectory of the light ray parameter b\u20d7 as\n\n\n    b\u20d7=[[k\u20d7\u00d7r\u20d7_0]\u00d7k\u20d7].\n\nNext, we introduce the parameter \u03c4=\u03c4(t) along the path of the light ray (see details in Appendix\u00a0B in <cit.>):\n\n\n    \u03c4   =   (k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)=(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7_0)+c(t-t_0),\n\nwhich may be positive or negative. The parameter \u03c4 allows us to rewrite (<ref>) as\n\n\n    r\u20d7(\u03c4)   =   b\u20d7+k\u20d7\u03c4+ O(G),\n         with     r(\u03c4) \u2261 |x\u20d7(\u03c4)|=\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+ O(G).\n\n\nUsing the result (<ref>) we determine that the following relations are valid to O (r_g):\n\n\n    r   =   \u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2),     \u00a0\u00a0  r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7) =\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2) +\u03c4.\n\nBased on these results, we present a useful relationship:\n\n\n    b^2=(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7))(r-(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)) + O(G).\n\n\nThis representation allows us to express the Newtonian part of the wave vector K^m presented by Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) as follows:\nk^m= dx^m/d\u03bb =k(1, k\u20d7)+ O(G), where the wave number k is immediately derived as k=d\u03c4/d\u03bb+ O(G) and |k\u20d7|=1. Keeping in mind that k^m is constant, we establish an important relationship:\n\n    d\u03bb= d\u03c4/k^0+ O(G),\n\nwhich we use to integrate (<ref>). This expression allows including contributions from all multipoles of the Earth's mass distribution, as given in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\n\nWith these definitions, we may now present the  solution to (<ref>) (see relevant discussion in <cit.>). The gravitational phase shift, \u03c6_G, that is acquired by the EM wave as it propagates along its geodesic path from the point of emission at \u03c4_0  to the point of reception at \u03c4 on the background of the gravitational field (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) has the form:\n\n\n    \u03c6_G(x\u20d7) =\n    -k\u222b^\u03c4_\u03c4_0{2/c^2(U_ E(\u03c4')+ u^ tidal_ E(\u03c4'))+ 4/c^3(k_\u03f5 w^\u03f5_ E(\u03c4'))\n    + O(G^2)\n    }d\u03c4'\n    \u2261\u03c6_G^ E(x\u20d7)+\u03c6_G^ tidal(x\u20d7)+\u03c6_G^ S(x\u20d7)+ O(G^2).\n\n\nWe may now integrate (<ref>) for each of the relativistic terms with the terms describing contributions from the Earth's gravitational potential, tidal gravity (primarily due to the Sun and the Moon), and Earth's rotation, correspondingly.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The STF representation of the  Earth's gravitational potential\n\n\n\nAlthough the form of the Earth gravitational potential (<ref>) is effective for many applications in geodesy, it is not technically convenient when light propagation in a gravitational field in concerned. No closed form expressions are known for the integral (<ref>) are known for a potential in the form (<ref>), expressed in terms of spherical harmonics; indeed, no useful semi-analytical approximations exist in the general case either. Thus, alternative representations of U(x\u20d7) are needed. In <cit.>, we considered the case of axisymmetric bodies. In <cit.>, we considered a generic potential, expanding U(x\u20d7) in terms of STF mass-moment tensors. Below, we discuss the the STF mass moment representation, which allows us to fully benefit from the spherical harmonics representation in the most general case. (In Appendix\u00a0<ref>, we discuss the less general axisymmetric case, using it as a limiting case to verify our results.)\n\nConsidering a generic case, it was discussed in <cit.> that the scalar gravitational potential (<ref>) may equivalently be given in terms of Cartesian spatial trace-free (STF) tensor moments in the following form:\n\n\n    U   =   GM{1/r+\u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e(-1)^\u2113/\u2113!

The dipole moment T^a is absent from this expansion (<ref>), by virtue of the fact that the origin of the coordinates is assumed to coincide with the body's barycenter.\n\nUsing the identity <cit.>,\n\n\n    \u2202^\u2113/\u2202 x^<a_1...\u2202 x^a_\u2113>(1/r)   =    (-1)^\u2113(2\u2113-1)!!n\u0302_<a_1...a_\u2113>/r^\u2113+1,\n\nthe potential (<ref>) may be given in the following form:\n\n\n    U(r\u20d7)   =    GM\u2211_\u2113\u2265 0(2\u2113-1)!!/\u2113 !

In fact, this expression may be used to establish the correspondence between T^<a_1...a_\u2113> and C_\u2113 k and S_\u2113 k from (<ref>) (see Appending\u00a0<ref> for details on how to establish this correspondence).\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Expressing the gravitational phase shift via STF mass moments\n\n\nUsing the representations (<ref>), (<ref>) or (<ref>), it is convenient to present  the U_ E-dependent term that yields \u03c6_G^ E(x\u20d7) in the total gravitational phase shift in (<ref>) as\n\n\n    2U/c^2   =   \n    r_g{1/r+ \u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e(-1)^\u2113/\u2113!

As such, this form is valid for any deviation from spherical symmetry in the gravitational field.\n\nWe may then generalize expression \u2207\u20d7=\u2207_b+k\u20d7 d/d\u03c4 + O(r_g) and write\n\n\n    \u2202^\u2113/\u2202 x^<a_1...\u2202 x^a_\u2113>   \u2261   \u2207\u20d7^<a_1....\u2207\u20d7^a_\u2113>=\u2211_p=0^\u2113\u2113!/p!(\u2113-p)!k_<a_1...k_a_p\u2202_a_p+1... \u2202_a_\u2113>\u2202^p/\u2202\u03c4^p+ O(r_g),\n\nwhere a new shorthand notation \u2202_a\u2261\u2202/\u2202b\u20d7^a has been used and \u03c4 is defined by (<ref>).\n\n Using this representation (<ref>), we can compute the relevant integral (with r=\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2) and r_0=\u221a(b^2+\u03c4_0^2), as discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>):\n \n\n    \u222b^\u03c4_\u03c4_0\u2202^\u2113/\u2202 x^<a_1...\u2202 x^a_\u2113>(1/r) d\u03c4'   =   \u2211_p=0^\u2113\u2113!/p!(\u2113-p)!k_<a_1...k_a_p\u2202_a_p+1... \u2202_a_\u2113>{\u2202^p/\u2202\u03c4^pln(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4/b)\n    }|^\u03c4_\u03c4_0 =\n           -140pt =\n     \u2202_<a_1... \u2202_a_\u2113>ln\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4_0+\n      \u2211_p=1^\u2113\u2113!/p!(\u2113-p)!k_<a_1...k_a_p\u2202_a_p+1... \u2202_a_\u2113>{\u2202^p-1/\u2202\u03c4^p-11/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)-\u2202^p-1/\u2202\u03c4_0^p-11/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4_0^2)}.\n\n\nAs a result, the gravitational eikonal phase shift \u03c6^ E_G from (<ref>) takes the form[Result (<ref>) was independently derived in  <cit.> where one can also find the phase contribution due to vector spherical harmonics.

As (<ref>) suggests, the total gravitational phase shift induced by all the multipoles \u2113\u22652 is a sum of the individual shifts \u03c6_\u2113 inducted by multipoles at each particular order \u2113, where \u03c6_\u2113 have the form\n\n\n    \u03c6_\u2113(r\u20d7, r\u20d7_0)\n        =      -kr_g (-1)^\u2113/\u2113! T ^<a_1...a_\u2113> I_a_1... a_\u2113(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0).\n\nIn what follows we will demonstrate how to compute individual terms in this sum.\n\nFirst, we recognize that the GCRS is defined by the unit basis vectors e\u20d7_x (the prime meridian) and e\u20d7_z\u2261s\u20d7 (the Earth's rotation axis), yielding the following set of base vectors:\n\n\n    e\u20d7_x,     e\u20d7_y=[e\u20d7_z\u00d7e\u20d7_x],     e\u20d7_z\u2261s\u20d7.\n\nNext, the propagation direction of the EM wave is defined by k\u20d7 and the relationship between the EM wave's trajectory and the Earth is given by the vector impact parameter b\u20d7 (introduced by (<ref>)):\n\n\n    k\u20d7=r\u20d7-r\u20d7_0/|r\u20d7-r\u20d7_0|,    b\u20d7=[[k\u20d7\u00d7r\u20d7_0]\u00d7k\u20d7]\u2261 b m\u20d7    \u21d2    m\u20d7=[[k\u20d7\u00d7r\u20d7_0]\u00d7k\u20d7]/|[[k\u20d7\u00d7r\u20d7_0]\u00d7k\u20d7]|.\n\nThus, once the GCRS positions of the emitter, r\u20d7_0, and receiver, r\u20d7,  are known,  everything else is computable.\n\nTo simplify the computations, we introduce a coordinate system associated with the propagating ray of light. Reading off figure\u00a0<ref>, with knowledge of k\u20d7, we obtain the unit vectors defining a coordinate system associated with the direction of transmission:\n\n    e\u20d7'_x    = [e\u20d7_z\u00d7e\u20d7'_z]/|[e\u20d7_z\u00d7e\u20d7'_z]|,\n        e\u20d7'_y= [e\u20d7'_z\u00d7e\u20d7'_x],\n         e\u20d7'_z \u2261k\u20d7.\n\n\nTogether, the vectors k\u20d7 and b\u20d7 allow us to define a rotated coordinate system, where the z-axis is aligned with the direction of propagation of the EM wave given by vector k\u20d7, while the xy-plane is perpendicular to it (see Fig.\u00a0<ref>). In this coordinate system, the vectors k\u20d7', b\u20d7',\nare given as below\n\n\n    k\u20d7'   =   (0,0,1),\n        b\u20d7'=b(cos\u03d5_\u03be,sin\u03d5_\u03be,0)=b m\u20d7',\n\nwhere b=|b\u20d7| from (<ref>) and\nthe orientation angle of the impact parameter, \u03d5_\u03be, is given by\n\n\n    cos\u03d5_\u03be  = (m\u20d7\u00b7e\u20d7'_x),     sin\u03d5_\u03be    = (m\u20d7\u00b7e\u20d7'_y).\n\n\n\n\nThe two coordinate systems are related by a rotation where R_a^b is the rotation matrix, given as\n\n\n    R(\u03b8,\u03c8)=R_3(\u03c8)R_1(\u03b8)=\n    [  cos\u03c8  sin\u03c8     0; -sin\u03c8  cos\u03c8     0;     0     0     1 ][     1     0     0;     0  cos\u03b8  sin\u03b8;     0 -sin\u03b8  cos\u03b8 ]\n    = R_a^b,\n\nwhere R_z(\u03c8) is a right-handed rotation by \u03c8 around the z-axis (e\u20d7_z-axis), R_1(\u03b8)  is a right-handed rotation by \u03b8 about the x-axis (e\u20d7'_x-axis) of a Cartesian coordinate frame; see Fig.\u00a0<ref>. The angles \u03b8 and \u03c8 are determined from the following equations:\n\n\n    cos\u03b8  = (e\u20d7'_z\u00b7e\u20d7_z),     sin\u03b8   = (e\u20d7'_y\u00b7e\u20d7_z),     cos\u03c8  = (e\u20d7'_x\u00b7e\u20d7_x),    sin\u03c8  = (e\u20d7'_x\u00b7e\u20d7_y).\n\n\nWith the introduction of these rotation matrices (<ref>), the geometry of the problem is fully defined. Technically, it is easier to compute the components of the projection operator  in  (<ref>) in the primed coordinate system that is aligned with  the light ray, yielding I'_a_1... a_\u2113. Two representations of this operator, in the GCRS, I_a_1... a_\u2113, and its counterpart in the light ray coordinates, I'_a_1... a_\u2113, are related by a simple rotation with the rotation matrix  R_a^b from (<ref>):\n\n\n    I_<b_1...b_\u2113>= I'_<a_1...a_\u2113>R^a_1_b_1... R^a_\u2113_b_\u2113,\n\nwhere I_a_1... a_\u2113 is expressed in terms of k\u20d7 and m\u20d7 defined in GCRS by (<ref>) and I'_a_1... a_\u2113 depends on k\u20d7' and m\u20d7' defined in the light ray coordinate system that was introduced by (<ref>).\n\nExpression (<ref>) allows us to write the term with tensorial inner product  in (<ref>) as\n\n\n    T ^<a_1...a_\u2113> I_a_1... a_\u2113=\n     T^<a_1...a_\u2113> R^b_1_a_1... R^b_\u2113_a_\u2113  I'_b_1... b_\u2113\u2261 T '^<a_1...a_\u2113> I'_a_1... a_\u2113,\n\nwhere T'^<a_l...a_\u2113> are the components of the STF mass moment tensor projected on the light ray trajectory\n\n\n    T'^<a_1...a_\u2113>= T^<b_1...b_\u2113> R^a_1_b_1... R^a_\u2113_b_\u2113.\n\n\nTypically, the STF tensor mass moments T^<a_1...a_\u2113> are expressed in terms of the spherical harmonic coefficients that, in turn, are expressed using the Cartesian ECEF coordinates of the GCRS. Expression (<ref>) allows us to compute the components of I_a_1... a_\u2113 in the rotated coordinate system that is aligned with the direction of propagation.\n\nThrough this rotation procedure with matrix (<ref>) and angles (<ref>), we are able to express the STF mass moments with respect to a cylindrical coordinate system in which the z-axis coincides with the direction of signal propagation. Moreover, as a non-degenerate linear relationship exists between STF tensor components and spherical harmonic coefficients (see Appendix\u00a0<ref>) for details), this procedure also allows us to directly compute spherical harmonic coefficients with respect to this new coordinate system in a three-step process:\n[1)]\n\n  * Convert spherical harmonics to the STF representation;\n\n  * Rotate the STF tensor using (<ref>),\n\n  * Invert the equation relating STF tensor components and spherical harmonics and solve for the latter.\n\nThis procedure is powerful and straightforward, also computationally inexpensive, allowing us to express the multipole mass moments of the gravitating body in a coordinate reference frame of arbitrary orientation, including the orientation defined by the direction of signal transmission.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PHASE SHIFT INTRODUCED BY THE LOWEST ORDER MULTIPOLE MOMENTS\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate the practical utility of our results, we now compute several low-order terms in (<ref>), for \u2113=2,3,4. In Appendix\u00a0<ref>, we compute the corresponding derivatives with respect to the vector impact parameter, which are present in (<ref>).  Below, we present the results for the eikonal phase shift for the quadrupole (\u2113=2), octupole (\u2113=3) and hexadecapole (\u2113=4) STF multipole moments.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Quadrupole moment\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The structure of the quadrupole phase shift\n\n\nIn the \u2113=2 quadrupole case, applying (<ref>) leads to the following expression for the gravitational eikonal phase shift  \u03c6_2(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0) induced by the quadrupole STF mass moment,  T^<ab>:\n\n\n    \u03c6_2(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)\n       =   -1/2 kr_g\n     T^<ab> I_ab(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0),\n\nwhere I_ab(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0) is the \u2113=2 light ray trajectory projection operator given by (<ref>), that is,\n\n\n    I_ab(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)   =   -\n    {(2m_am_b+k_ak_b)\n    1/r(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7))\n    +\n    (k_ak_b-m_am_b)\n    (k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^3+\n    (k_am_b+k_bm_a)\n    b/r^3}|^r_r_0,\n\nwhere we used the derivatives (<ref>) and (<ref>) and k\u20d7 and m\u20d7 are defined by (<ref>). After some rearrangement,  expression (<ref>) may be presented  is the following equivalent form:\n\n\n    I_ab(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)   =   {(2m_am_b+k_ak_b)(\n    1/r(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7))-(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/2r^3)\n    +\n    (k_am_b+k_bm_a)\n    b/r^3+\n    3/2k_ak_b\n    (k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^3}|^r_r_0.\n\nThe convenience of the form (<ref>) is due to the fact that in the light ray's coordinate system that we use, k\u20d7 is a unit vector in the e'_z-axis direction, whereas m\u20d7 is a unit vector in the perpendicular e'_xe'_y-plane. This simplifies various inner products in (<ref>) which, relying on (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) with parameterization (<ref>) take the form:\n\n\n    T^<ab>(2m_am_b+k_ak_b)\n    = T'^<ab>(2m'_am'_b+k'_ak'_b)\n       =   ( T'_11- T'_22)cos2\u03d5_\u03be+2 T'_12sin2\u03d5_\u03be,\n\nwhere k\u20d7' and m\u20d7' are from (<ref>) and we specifically emphasized the use of (<ref>), a reminder to the reader that this scalar-valued tensor product is not dependent on the choice of coordinate system in which it is calculated, allowing us to express the product in this simple form, using the values of the STF tensor and the projection operator in the rotated light-ray coordinate system. Similarly,\n\n\n    T^<ab>(k_am_b+k_bm_a)   =   2 T'_13cos\u03d5_\u03be+2 T'_23sin\u03d5_\u03be,\n     T^<ab>\n    k_ak_b   =    T'_33,\n\n where we relied on the trace-free nature of T^<ab>, valid in any representation, hence  T'_11+ T'_22+ T'_33=0.\n\nAs a result, using these expressions (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) and representing m\u20d7 using from (<ref>), expression (<ref>)\ntakes the form\n\n\n    \u03c6_2(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)\n       =   1/2kr_g\n    {{( T'_11- T'_22)cos2\u03d5_\u03be+\n     2 T'_12sin2\u03d5_\u03be}(\n     1/r(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7))-(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/2r^3)\n    +\n           14pt+ \n    2{ T'_13 cos\u03d5_\u03be+\n     T'_23 sin\u03d5_\u03be}b/r^3+3 T'_33(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/2r^3}|^r_r_0.\n\nThus, as the light travels from a transmitter to a receiver, it samples the gravitational filed along its path.

We work this out explicitly for \u2113=2 in Appendix\u00a0<ref>, yielding the matrix components of T^<ab> in the GCRS reference frame in the form (<ref>):\n\n\n    T_11   =   (-1/3C_20+2C_22)R^2,      T_12=2S_22R^2, \n     T_22   =   (-1/3C_20-2C_22)R^2,      T_13=C_21R^2,\n     T_33   =   2/3 C_20 R^2,               \u00a0\u00a0 T_23=S_21R^2,\n\nor, using the relations between T^<ab> and C_2k, S_2k from (<ref>), we may express T'^<ab> as\n\n\n    R^-2 T'_11   =    -1/3  C_20+2(C_22cos2\u03c8-S_22sin2\u03c8),\n    \n    R^-2 T'_22   =   1/3(3sin^2\u03b8-1)  C_20-sin2\u03b8(C_21sin\u03c8+S_21cos\u03c8)+2cos^2\u03b8(S_22sin2\u03c8-C_22cos2\u03c8),\n    \n    R^-2 T'_33   =   1/3(3cos^2\u03b8-1)C_20+sin2\u03b8(C_21sin\u03c8+S_21cos\u03c8)+2sin^2\u03b8(S_22sin2\u03c8-C_22cos2\u03c8),\n    \n    R^-2 T'_12   =    -\n    sin\u03b8(C_21cos\u03c8-S_21sin\u03c8)+2cos\u03b8(S_22cos2\u03c8+C_22sin2\u03c8),\n    \n    R^-2 T'_13   =   cos\u03b8(C_21cos\u03c8-S_21sin\u03c8)+2sin\u03b8(S_22cos2\u03c8+C_22sin2\u03c8),\n    \n    R^-2 T'_23   =    -\n    1/2sin2\u03b8 \n    C_20+cos2\u03b8(C_21sin\u03c8+S_21cos\u03c8)-sin2\u03b8(C_22cos2\u03c8-S_22sin2\u03c8),\n\nwhere angles \u03b8 and \u03c8 are fixed for each transmitter-receiver configuration and are given by (<ref>).\n\nWe define the rotated spherical harmonic coefficients {C'_2k,S'_2k} by substituting primed in place of unprimed terms in (<ref>) and then solving the resulting system of equations. For \u2113=2, this results in the following relations between {C'_2k,S'_2k} and T'^<ab>:\n\n\n    C'_20 =  3/2 R^-2 T'_33,\n         C'_21   =    R^-2 T'_13,\n         C'_22 = 1/4 R^-2( T'_11- T'_22),\n        \n    S'_21 = R^-2 T'_23,\n         \n    S'_22 = 1/2 R^-2 T'_12.\n\n\nDue to the tensorial nature of (<ref>), both expressions (<ref>) and (<ref>) demonstrate the form invariance of the gravitational phase (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>). The structure of the expression for the gravitational phase is the same in any new rotated coordinates, thus for any direction of signal propagation. Furthermore, the relationship between the STF tensor mass moments and  spherical harmonics, T^<ab>\u21d4{C_2k,S_2k}, given by (<ref>), is also the same in any new coordinates, T'^<ab>\u21d4{C'_2k,S'_2k}. This form invariance of the phase and relevant relations between the moments and harmonics exist at any STF order \u2113.  This property may be used to establish expressions for the spherical harmonics C'_\u2113 k,S'_\u2113 k at any order \u2113 and will be demonstrated below for \u2113=2,3,4.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Quadrupole phase in terms of spherical harmonics\n\n\nResults (<ref>) and (<ref>) allow us to express (<ref>)\n in terms of the rotated spherical harmonic coefficients C'_2k,S'_2k.

Some of the relevant expressions for the STF tensors and its relations to harmonic coefficients C_\u2113 k, S_\u2113 k in (<ref>) for orders \u2113=3,4 are given in <cit.>.  These results may be extended to arbitrary orders \u2113.\n\nExpressions (<ref>) relate the values of the spherical harmonics coefficients that are sampled by the propagating EM wave, C'_\u2113 k, S'_\u2113 k, to  those that are typically reported in in the standard GCRS coordinates, C_\u2113 k, S_\u2113 k. For that we performed the rotation of the standard harmonics onto the direction of the light propagation given by k\u20d7.\n\nWe note that the change of spherical harmonics under a linear transformation of coordinates has been studied in the past, with a rich history (see, e.g., <cit.>). In our case, the transformation rules that correspond to rotating the north pole axis to coincide with k\u20d7 were accomplished with relative ease as an additional benefit of the use of the STF tensor formalism, which we invoked primarily in order to integrate the eikonal equation. The process, as we shall see below, is easily generalized to higher order harmonics.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The case of an axisymmetric body\n\n\nWe know that, in the case of an axisymmetric gravitating body, all of the spherical harmonic coefficients accept for C_20 vanish, namely C_21=C_22=S_21=S_22=0. In this case, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), with the help of (<ref>), takes the familiar form:\n\n\n    \u03c6_2(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)\n       =   1/2kr_gC_20R^2_\u2295{-sin^2\u03b8cos2\u03d5_\u03be1/r(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7))+\n    \n           55pt+ (cos^2\u03b8-\n    sin^2\u03b8sin^2\u03d5_\u03be)\n    (k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^3-\n    sin2\u03b8sin\u03d5_\u03beb/r^3}|^r_r_0.\n\nAlternatively, using J_2=-C_20 and relying on the definitions of the unit vectors b\u20d7, k\u20d7 and m\u20d7, we present (<ref>) as\n\n\n    \u03c6^ E_2(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)\n    = -1/2kr_gJ_2R_\u2295^2 {(2(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2+(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2-1)\n    1/r(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7))+\n    ((s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2-(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2)(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^3+\n    2(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7) (s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7) b/r^3}|^r_r_0.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Octupole moment\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The structure of the octupole phase shift\n\n\nSetting \u2113=3 in (<ref>) and (<ref>), we use the result for the two types of derivatives (<ref>) and (<ref>). We derive the eikonal phase shift, \u03c6_3(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0), introduced by the octupole STF mass moment, T^<abc>, which may be given as\n\n\n    \u03c6_3(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)\n       =   1/6 kr_g\n     T^<abc> I_abc(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0),\n\nwhere I_abc(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0) is  light ray trajectory projection operator of the order of \u2113=3 that is given as\n\n\n    I_abc(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)   =   {(4m_am_bm_c+3k_ak_bm_c) 1/b(2/r(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7) )-(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^3)+\n       +   3(3k_ak_bm_c-m_am_bm_c)b(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^5+\n    3(3k_am_bm_c-k_ak_bk_c)b^2/r^5+\n    5k_ak_bk_c/r^3}|^r_r_0.\n\nSimilarly to (<ref>), we re-arrange  (<ref>) to separate individual projection operators\n\n\n    I_abc(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)   =    2{(4m_am_bm_c+3k_ak_bm_c) {1/b(1/r(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7) )-(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/2r^3)-\n    3/8b(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^5}+\n       +   9/2(k_am_bm_c+1/2k_ak_bk_c)\n    b^2/r^5+45/8k_ak_bm_c b(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^5+\n    5/2k_ak_bk_c1/r^3(1-3/2b^2/r^2)\n    }|^r_r_0,\n\nwhere, again, k\u20d7, m\u20d7 are given by (<ref>). Note that there is no need to explicitly STF this quantity as it will be acting on the STF tensor T^<abc> in (<ref>).\n\nAgain, the form (<ref>) is convenient because it simplifies various inner products in (<ref>) when expressed in the light ray's coordinate system:\n\n\n    T^<abc>(4m_am_bm_c+3k_ak_bm_c)   =   ( T'_111-3 T'_122)cos3\u03d5_\u03be+(3 T'_112- T'_222)sin3\u03d5_\u03be,\n    \n     T^<abc>(k_am_bm_c+1/2k_ak_bk_c)   =   1/2( T'_113- T'_223)cos2\u03d5_\u03be+ T'_123sin2\u03d5_\u03be,\n    \n     T^<abc>k_ak_bm_c   =    T'_133cos\u03d5_\u03be+ T'_233sin\u03d5_\u03be,\n    \n     T^<abc> k_ak_bk_c   =    T'_333.\n\n\n As a result, the octupole gravitational phase shift corresponding to \u2113=3 from (<ref>) takes the following  form:\n\n\n    \u03c6_3(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)\n       =   1/3 kr_g\n    {{( T'_111-3 T'_122)cos3\u03d5_\u03be+(3 T'_112- T'_222)sin3\u03d5_\u03be}{1/b(1/r(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7) )-(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/2r^3)-3/8 b(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^5}+\n       +   9/4{( T'_113- T'_223)cos2\u03d5_\u03be+2 T'_123sin2\u03d5_\u03be}b^2/r^5+\n    45/8{ T'_133cos\u03d5_\u03be+ T'_233sin\u03d5_\u03be}b(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^5\n    +\n       +   5/2 T'_3331/r^3(\n    1-3/2b^2/r^2)\n    }|^r_r_0.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Rotating the octupole mass moment\n\n\nThe next step is to express T'^<abc> present in (<ref>) in terms of the spherical harmonics coefficients. For that, we  implement the rotation of T^<abc> in accordance with (<ref>):\n\n\n    T'^<abc>   =    T^<ijk>  R^a_i  R^b_j  R^c_k,\n\n where T^<ijk> are the components of the Cartesian representation of the octupole mass tensor in the GCRS.  These components are known and are related to the  spherical harmonics C_3k,S_3k. In Appendix\u00a0<ref>, we established the relationship between STF moments and spherical harmonics for \u2113=2. The same approach may be used for \u2113=3 to establish the  the correspondence between T^<abc> from (<ref>) and the spherical harmonics from (<ref>)  and (<ref>). The result given by\n\n\n    T_111   =   (3/5C_31-6C_33)R^3,       T_112=(1/5S_31-6S_33)R^3,\n           T_113=(-1/5C_30+2C_32)R^3,\n    \n     T_122   =   (1/5C_31+6C_33)R^3,       T_222=(3/5S_31+6S_33)R^3,\n           T_223=(-1/5C_30-2C_32)R^3,\n    \n     T_123   =   2S_32R^3,        T_133=-4/5C_31R^3,         T_233=-4/5S_31R^3,         T_333=2/5C_30R^3.\n\nIt is easy to check that the rank-3 STF tensor T^<abc> has seven independent components; the values of the remaining 20 components are determined by its symmetries and vanishing trace. The system of equations (<ref>) is redundant, with only seven independent equations relating the components of T^<abc> to the seven spherical harmonic coefficients in the case \u2113=3.\n\nWe can now implement the rotation (<ref>) that in accordance with (<ref>) and obtain the following components of the STF mass moments  T'^<abc> expressed via spherical harmonics of GCRS system:\n\n\n    R^-3 T'_111   =   3/5(C_31cos\u03c8 -

The significance of these terms and their contributions to the phase shift is application-dependent. As a general observation, we note that the contributions of all but the quadrupole zonal harmonic C_20=-J_2 are small, with typical magnitudes of kc  O(10^-14\u00a0 s) or less. Therefore, for many applications accounting only for J_2 and C_22, S_22 may be sufficient, ignoring most of the tesseral, sectoral, and higher-order terms.\n\n\n\nEvaluating the phase delay using a ground-based transmitter for a variety of scenarios yielded the results shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. As expected, the largest contribution is due to the quadrupole moment, but it remains small, never exceeding \u223c 0.01\u00a0ps in magnitude. The contributions of the octupole and hexadecapole moments are much less, measured in hundredths of femtoseconds. For consistency, the cases depicted in Fig.\u00a0<ref> all involve ground-based transmitters. To assess the delay between two distant stations in space, the phase delays shown in the top row of images of Fig.\u00a0<ref> must be multiplied by two, to account for the incoming and outgoing leg of a transmission grazing the Earth's surface (similar to the situation discussed in <cit.>). For signal paths with a larger impact parameter, the phase delay decreases, so the curves in the top row of Fig.\u00a0<ref> represent upper limits for such transmissions.\n\nWe may wonder why even the quadrupole contribution remains small, perhaps surprisingly small, in all the cases considered. When we look at Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>), (<ref>) and (<ref>), there are three competing factors at work, which are best understood if we recall that ultimately, all variable terms in these expressions, including the impact parameter b defined in (<ref>), are functions of the vector quantities r\u20d7_0 and r\u20d7, and that moreover, these expressions, developed by integrating the eikonal equation, are themselves differences of values evaluated at r\u20d7 and r\u20d7_0.\n\nTo wit, when b is small, it implies a near vertical transmission. In these cases, terms with b in the numerator become insignificant, whereas k\u20d7\u00b7n\u20d7\u2243 1. Looking at, e.g., (<ref>), we can see how as a result, all terms vanish, or nearly vanish from the result. Conversely, a large b implies transmission in the horizontal direction. Again looking at (<ref>), this implies that k\u20d7\u00b7n\u20d7\u226a 1. Of the remaining terms, the coefficient 1 in the first term of (<ref>) does not depend on r\u20d7 so it is canceled when we compute the difference between r\u20d7 and r\u20d7_0. What remains, the namely the C'_21 and S'_21 terms, are small to begin with as these are the terms that include no contribution from the largest spherical harmonic coefficient C_20.\nAs a result of this interplay between the value of b, the value of k\u20d7\u00b7n\u20d7, and the differencing between r\u20d7 and r\u20d7_0, the magnitude of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) remains small. Similar behavior is exhibited by the octupole and hexadecapole expressions (<ref>) and (<ref>).\n\nWhile these contributions are much too small to affect time synchronization with present-generation clocks, they will likely become significant in the near future, as clocks of even greater accuracy are deployed. Furthermore, while these phase shifts are insignificant for time synchronization, they represent a substantial contribution for phase-coherent transmissions and as such, they will have to be accounted for in any implementations or experiments that use phase coherent infrared or shorter wavelength signals. This includes experiments that rely on optical interferometry with signal paths in the gravitational field of the Earth.\n\nAlthough the formalism that we introduced on these pages is aimed primarily at estimating the gravitational phase delay in the vicinity of the Earth, the methods are generic and can be readily applied to other gravitating bodies. We looked, in particular, at the quadrupole contribution to the Shapiro delay for a signal grazing the Sun. We found that if such a signal travels in the solar equatorial plane, the maximum phase delay due to the solar quadrupole moment (which is very small, J_2\u2243 -2.3\u00d7 10^-7 only) is less than 1.1\u00a0ps. The Sun has no measured octupole moment (it is \u201cnorth-south symmetric\u201d in addition to axisymmetry) and its hexadecapole moment contributes even less, at the sub-femtosecond level.\n\nFinally, we looked at Jupiter, anticipating the possibility that future orbiters at Jupiter or one of its moons will utilize precision signals grazing the Jovian surface. Jupiter is not only massive but has substantial oblateness (J_2=-1.474\u00d7 10^-2) and although it, too, is \u201cnorth-south symmetric\u201d, its hexadecapole moment remains substantial as well. Indeed, we find that for a transmission grazing Jupiter's surface in its equatorial plane, the cumulative phase delay due to the planet's quadrupole moment can reach 70\u00a0ps, and even the hexadecapole moment can contribute more than 2\u00a0ps.\n\nComing back to the Earth, we also assessed the magnitudes of contributions due to spin and solar and lunar tides. For realistic signal paths within the vicinity of the Earth, these contributions remain very small: tidal contributions are of O(0.01\u00a0 ps), whereas the spin contribution is less than 0.1\u00a0femptoseconds (fs). Comparatively, tidal contributions are approximately of the same magnitude as the contribution of the Earth's quadrupole moment, whereas the spin contribution is on the level of the octupole or hexadecapole moments.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Relativistic gravitational phase shift\n\n\n\nBased on the analysis in the earlier sections, we can now write the post-Minkowskian expresison for the phase of an EM wave that propagates in the vicinity of the extended and rotating gravitating body, such as the Earth. In the body's proper reference frame (a formulation that accounts for the presence of the external gravity field produced by the external bodies of the N-body system <cit.>), collecting all the appropriate contributions  coming from the Earth's mass distribution \u03c6^ E_G, Earth's rotation \u03c6^ S_G, and external gravity \u03c6^ tidal_G, the total phase Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) has the form:\n\n\n    \u03c6(t,x\u20d7) = \u03c6_0+\u222b k_m dx^m+\u03c6^ E_G(t,x\u20d7)+\u03c6^ S_G(t,x\u20d7)+\u03c6^ tidal_G(t,x\u20d7)+ O(G^2).\n\n\nWe now have the ability to evaluate this expression at previously unavailable levels of accuracy using expressions for the quadrupole term, \u03c6^ E_2, from (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>), for the octupole term \u03c6_3, from (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>),  for the hexadecapole term, \u03c6_4, from (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>), and expressions (<ref>) and (<ref>) for the tidal, \u03c6^ tidal_G, and rotational, \u03c6^ S_G, terms, correspondingly.  This level of accuracy, however, may be excessive in practical cases. For instance, if a time transfer accuracy of 10^-12\u00a0s, is acceptable, for some GPS applications, the result can be given as\n\n\n    \u03c6(t,x\u20d7)    =   \u03c6_0+k{c(t-t_0)-k\u20d7\u00b7 (x\u20d7-x\u20d7_0)-r_gln[r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r_0+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7_0)]+\n       +   1/2r_g(R_\u2295/b)^2\n    {cos2\u03d5_\u03be[C_20sin^2\u03b8\n    +2(1+cos^2\u03b8)(S_22sin2\u03c8-C_22cos2\u03c8)]-\n           42pt- \n    4sin2\u03d5_\u03be[\n    cos\u03b8(S_22cos2\u03c8+C_22sin2\u03c8)]}(k\u20d7\u00b7(n\u20d7-n\u20d7_0))}+\n    kc  O(\u226a 0.01\u00a0 ps).\n\nAs discussed in Sec\u00a0<ref>, the  angles \u03b8, \u03c8 and \u03d5_\u03be are uniquely defined  in terms of the GCRS positions of the transmitter, r\u20d7_0, and the receiver, r\u20d7. The order terms are due to the omitted quadrupole and higher-order multipole contributions.  We included the dominant quadrupole contribution but we note that it, too, is very small, O(0.01\u00a0 ps), so if only picosecond accuracy is required, the quadrupole term can also be dropped.\n\nEq.\u00a0(<ref>) extends the well-known expression for relativistic delay. In addition to the classic Shapiro gravitational time delay due to a mass monopole (represented by the logarithmic term), it also includes contributions due to quadrupole moment of the extended Earth, C_20=-J_2 and C_22,S_22 spherical harmonics (see Table\u00a0<ref>). Additional terms may be included from the preceding derivation if greater accuracy is required.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n\n\nSatellites in low-Earth orbit are affected by a broad spectrum of perturbations due to the Earth's gravity field. The largest of these perturbations are produced by the Earth's oblateness, J_2.  Beyond the oblateness, there exist much smaller undulations of higher order in the gravity field. These variations produce lesser, but certainly observable effects on low-Earth orbiters <cit.>. The same gravity perturbations affect clocks and light propagation in the Earth's vicinity. However, most of the models capture only relativistic corrections due to the Earth's monopole potential, such as the Shapiro phase delay term \u2013 the largest among the relevant gravitational effects. Beyond that, only the contribution of the Earth's oblateness, characterized by J_2=-C_20, was accounted for (e.g. <cit.>). No models capturing the contributions of other multipole moments present in the Earth's gravity potential were available.\n\nIn this paper, we addressed this challenge with the aim to obtain results in terms of the spherical harmonics. We studied the transformation between proper and coordinate time and the propagation of an EM wave in the vicinity of a gravitating body with a gravitational potential that deviates from a perfect monopole, such as the Earth. We found that at the present level of accuracy, more and more terms from the Earth's gravitational potential must be included in the model formulations. In fact, the lower the orbit of a satellite, more terms are needed.  Also, for high orbits, tidal gravity from the moon (and soon, that of the Sun) becomes significant and needs to be accounted for.\n\nTo study the light propagation in the vicinity fo the Earth, we represented the gravitational potential in terms of the symmetric trace-free (STF) Cartesian tensor mass multipole moments. The multipole expansion is one of the most useful tools of physics, but its use in general relativity is difficult because of the nonlinearity of the theory and the tensorial character of the gravitational interaction <cit.>.\nSTF tensors offer a mathematically equivalent representation of the multipole mass moments of a gravitating body, but with significant practical advantages over spherical harmonics. First, the tensorial nature of the STF representation makes it possible to express relationships in a coordinate system independent fashion, leading to a remarkable form invariance that is preserved even in coordinate representations that are rotated relative to each other. Second, the relationship between the spherical harmonic coefficients and the STF tensor components expressed in a Cartesian coordinate system is linear and nondegenerate, which means it is always invertible. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, utilizing the STF tensor representation of the mass multipole moments allowed us to integrate the eikonal equation to all STF orders \u2113.\n\nWith the solution of the eikonal equation at hand, we demonstrated a straightforward procedure to obtain the Cartesian STF components from spherical harmonic coefficients. We explicitly carried out this procedure in the cases of the quadrupole, octupole, and hexadecapole (\u2113=2,3,4) cases. In all these cases, the form invariance of the result made it possible to express the corresponding phase shift in a remarkably simple, elegant form in terms of rotated spherical harmonic coefficients. The mechanics of the rotation, in turn, can be carried out by first obtaining STF tensor components in the original coordinate system, performing the rotation next, and finally by solving a linear system of equations that has the same form in the unrotated and rotated coordinate frames. Clearly, the same approach may be used to extend our results to any order \u2113. The resulting equations are compact even for higher values of \u2113, and are directly actionable.\n\nNote that in this paper we dealt only with the STF mass moments that are used to represent the scalar external gravitational potential (<ref>) and the relevant scalar spherical harmonics. The same approach may be used to consider the contributions from the vector potential due to body's rotation (<ref>), and the relevant STF current moments and vector spherical harmonics.  As our objective was to consider measurements in the Earth's vicinity, any contribution from the Earth's vector potential is currently negligible, but may be addressed with the same tools presented here.\n\nThe numerical magnitudes of these corrections are small. Considering present-generation clocks, only the quadrupole term offers a significant contribution and only insofar as proper time to coordinate time conversions are concerned. However, the gravitational phase delay due to the quadrupole and higher order terms may become relevant with next generation clocks. These terms can also be very significant for phase coherent signaling at infrared or shorter wavelengths. We also applied our formalism for signals traversing in the vicinity of the Sun and, especially, Jupiter, and found more significant contributions, which may in the foreseeable future become relevant for deep space precision navigation and observations in the solar system.\n\nThe results presented here are new. They offer a comprehensive model for the gravitational phase shift of a EM wave as it propagates in the gravitational  field of the extended Earth.  As the performance of new generation of precision clocks increases, such results may have a wide range of practical applications, including clock synchronization, frequency transfer and interferometry. They may also lead to new uses including relativistic geodesy <cit.>.  These and other possibilities are currently being investigated. Results, when available, will be reported elsewhere.\n\n\n\nWe thank Yoaz E. Bar-Sever and William I.

For that we use (<ref>) and write\n\n\n    U^[2](r\u20d7)    =   G/r^3(P_20C_20 + P_21(C_21cos\u03c8 + S_21sin\u03c8) + P_22(C_22cos 2\u03c8 + S_22sin 2\u03c8)).\n\nUsing a spherical coordinate system (x = r sin\u03b8cos\u03c8, y = r sin\u03b8sin\u03c8, z = r cos\u03b8), we have\nr^2P_20 = (2z^2 -x^2 -y^2)/2,\nr^2P_21cos\u03c8 = 3xz,\nr^2P_21sin\u03c8 = 3yz,\nr^2P_22cos 2\u03c8 = 3(x^2 - y^2),\nr^2P_22sin 2\u03c8 = 6xy. Substituting these expressions in (<ref>), we get\n\n    U^[2](r\u20d7)    =   GM/r^5(C_201/2(2z^2 - x^2- y^2) + 3C_21 xz+ 3S_21yz + 3C_22(x^2-y^2)+6S_22 xy).\n\n\nFrom (<ref>), we have the same quantity expressed via the components of the STF quadrupole moment T_<ab>:\n\n\n    U^[2](r\u20d7)   =   GM 3 T^<ab>/2r^5x^ax^b=\n    GM 3/2r^5( T_11x^2+2 T_12xy+2 T_13xz+2 T_23yz+ T_22y^2+ T_33z^2).\n\n\nEquating the terms with the same powers of x,y,z  between the from of the potential in terms of spherical harmonics present in (<ref>) and that expressed via the STF mass quadrupole in (<ref>) yields the following relations:\n\n\n    T_11   =   (-1/3C_20+2C_22)R^2,      T_12=2S_22R^2, \n     T_22   =   (-1/3C_20-2C_22)R^2,      T_13=C_21R^2,\n     T_33   =   2/3 C_20 R^2,               \u00a0\u00a0 T_23=S_21R^2.\n\n\nFollowing the same approach, we can establish the corresponding relationships between STF multipole moments at any order \u2113 and the appropriate  spherical harmonics coefficients, see (<ref>), (<ref>), and the relevant discussion in <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 USEFUL RELATIONS FOR SOME STF ORDERS\n\n\n\nWe derive several low order terms in (<ref>). First, we recognize that with k\u20d7 being constant, the two-dimensional vector b\u20d7 and the one-dimensional quantity \u03c4, from (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>), may be treated as two independent variables, yielding dx^a=db^a+k^ad\u03c4 and also \u2202/\u2202 x^a=\u2202/\u2202 b^a+k^a \u2202/\u2202\u03c4, where differentiation with respect to b\u20d7 is carried out in two dimensions only, which is indicated by the hatted notation. Then, to compute the needed partial derivatives in (<ref>), with respect to the vector of the impact parameter, \u2202\u0302_a\u2261\u2202/\u2202 b^a\u2261(\u2202/\u2202 b^x,\u2202/\u2202 b^y,0) in our chosen Cartesian coordinate system, we may formally write\n\n\n    \u2202 x^a/\u2202 x^b= \u03b4^a_b= {\u2202\u0302_b+k_b \u2202/\u2202\u03c4}{b^a+k^a \u03c4 + O(r_g)}=\u2202\u0302_b b^a+k^a k_b+ O(r_g).\n\nBy re-arranging the terms in this identity, we obtain the following useful  expression (see also <cit.>):\n\n\n    \u2202\u0302_b b^a   =   \u03b4^a_b -k^a k_b.\n\nThis result essentially is the projection operator onto the plane perpendicular to k\u20d7, namely P^ab=\u03b4^ab-k^ak^b; this plane, given either GCRS (<ref>) or light ray (<ref>) parameterizations, is the plane of the impact parameter b\u20d7 and where b^a is the  a-th component of the vector impact parameter.\n\nTo evaluate (<ref>), we need to compute the following sets of derivatives:\n\n\n    \u2202_<a_1... \u2202_a_\u2113>ln k(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)\n     \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2211_p=1^\u2113\u2113!/p!(\u2113-p)!k_<a_1...k_a_p\u2202_a_p+1... \u2202_a_\u2113>{\u2202^p-1/\u2202\u03c4^p-11/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)}.\n\n\nThe first type of the  derivatives needed to compute the terms with \u2113=1,2,3,4 are\n\n\n    \u2202\u0302_a ln k(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)   =   1/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4b_a/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2),\n    \n    \u2202\u0302^2_abln k(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)   =   1/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c41/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2){P_ab-1/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)(1/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4+1/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2))b_ab_b},\n    \n    \u2202\u0302^3_abcln k(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)   =    -P_abb_c+P_acb_b+P_bcb_a/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)(b^2+\u03c4^2)/(1/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4+1/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2))+\n           -50pt + b_ab_bb_c/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)(b^2+\u03c4^2)^3/2{2/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)^2+3/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+3/b^2+\u03c4^2},\n    \n    \u2202\u0302^4_abcdln k(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)   =    -(P_abP_cd+P_acP_bd+P_adP_bc)/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)(b^2+\u03c4^2)/(1/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4+1/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2))+\n           -100pt + (P_abb_cb_d+P_acb_bb_d+P_bcb_ab_d+P_adb_bb_c+P_bdb_ab_c+P_cdb_ab_b)\u00d7\n           -50pt \u00d7 1/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)(b^2+\u03c4^2)^3/2{2/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)^2+3/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+3/b^2+\u03c4^2}-\n           -100pt - b_ab_bb_cb_d/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)(b^2+\u03c4^2)^2{6/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)^3+12/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)^2\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\n           20pt + 15/(\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\u03c4)(b^2+\u03c4^2)+\n    15/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^3/2}.\n\n\nWe also need the following derivatives for \u2113=2,3,4:\n-12pt\n\n    \u2211_p=1^2 2!/p!(2-p)!k_<a_1...k_a_p\u2202\u0302_a_p+1... \u2202\u0302_a_2>\u2202^p-1/\u2202\u03c4^p-11/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)   =   \n    -2k_ab_b+\u03c4 k_ak_b/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^3/2,\n     \n    \u2211_p=1^3 3!/p!(3-p)!k_<a_1...k_a_p\u2202\u0302_a_p+1... \u2202\u0302_a_3>\u2202^p-1/\u2202\u03c4^p-11/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)   =   \n           -170pt = \n    3k_a(3b_bb_c/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^5/2-P_bc/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^3/2)+9k_ak_bb_c  \u03c4/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^5/2+k_ak_bk_c(3\u03c4^2/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^5/2-1/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^3/2),\n     \n    \u2211_p=1^4 4!/p!(4-p)!k_<a_1...k_a_p\u2202\u0302_a_p+1... \u2202\u0302_a_4>\u2202^p-1/\u2202\u03c4^p-11/\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)   =   \n           -200pt = \n    4k_a(3/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^5/2(P_dcb_b+P_bdb_c+P_bcb_d)-15b_bb_cb_d/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^7/2)+18k_ak_b  \u03c4(P_cd/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^5/2 -5b_cb_d/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^7/2)+\n    \n           -170pt + \n    4k_ak_bk_c(3b_d/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^5/2-15\u03c4^2  b_d/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^7/2)+\n    k_ak_bk_ck_d(9\u03c4/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^5/2-15\u03c4^3/(b^2+\u03c4^2)^7/2).\n\nClearly, the same expressions may be used to describe the terms that depend on \u03c4_0.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 GRAVITATIONAL PHASE DELAY FOR AN AXISYMMETRIC BODY\n\n\n\nIn the case of an axisymmetric body (i.e., the Sun), its external gravitational potential is reduced to the k=0 zonal harmonics, where we keep on the the terms of J_\u2113=-C_\u2113 0 with all other terms in the expression for the potential  (<ref>) vanish, i.e., C_\u2113 k=S_\u2113 k=0. As a result, the   gravitational potential of an axisymmetric body may be expressed in terms of the usual dimensionless multipole moments J_\u2113 (see discussion in <cit.>):\n\n\n    U(x\u20d7)   =   GM/r{1-\u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e J_\u2113(R/r)^\u2113 P_\u2113(k\u20d7_3\u00b7x\u20d7/r)}+\n     O(c^-4),\n\nwhere k\u20d7_3 denotes the unit vector along the x^3-axis, P_\u2113 are the Legendre polynomials. Furthermore, in the case of an axisymmetric and rotating body with \u201cnorth-south symmetry\u201d, the expression (<ref>) contains only the even moments or \u2113=2,4,6,8...  <cit.>. Below, we will not impose the \u201cnorth-south symmetry\u201d restriction and will keep the terms of all the orders \u2113.\n\nFollowing <cit.>, we take into account the identity\n\n\n    \u2202^\u2113/\u2202 z^\u2113(1/r)   =   (-1)^\u2113\u2113!/r^1+\u2113 P_\u2113(k\u20d7_3\u00b7x\u20d7/r),      z=x^3,\n\nand present  U as the following expansion in a series of derivatives of 1/r:\n\n\n    U(x\u20d7)   =   GM{1/r-\u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e(-1)^\u2113/\u2113! J_\u2113  R^\u2113\u2202^\u2113/\u2202 z^\u2113(1/r)}+\n     O(c^-4).\n\nAs we shall see below, this form is much more convenient  for the computation of integrals involving  U.\n\nHere we develop an expression for the eikonal phase in the case of an axisymmetric body, with its potential given by (<ref>).\nIn this case, the decomposition of the post-Newtonian potential takes the from\n\n\n    2U/c^2   =   \n    r_g{1/r-\u2211_\u2113=2^\u221e(-1)^\u2113/\u2113! J_\u2113  R^\u2113\u2202^\u2113/\u2202 s^\u2113(1/r)}+ O(r_g^2).\n\n\nFollowing the approach demonstrated in <cit.> (see Appendix therein), we compute the leading term of this expansion. For that, we define the vector s\u20d7 to be a unit vector in the direction of the axis of rotation. Remembering that r=\u221a(b^2+\u03c4^2)+ O(r_g) from (<ref>), we evaluate directional derivatives \u2202/\u2202 s along  s\u20d7= k\u20d7_3, which have the form\n\n\n    \u2202/\u2202 s=(s\u20d7\u00b7\u2207\u20d7)=(s\u20d7\u00b7\u2202/\u2202r\u20d7).\n\nThis relation allows us to compute the relevant partial derivatives for the leading terms in (<ref>):\n\n\n    \u2202/\u2202 s 1/r   =   -(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^3,     \u2202^2/\u2202 s^2 1/r=3(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)^2/r^5-1/r^3,\n        \u2202^3/\u2202 s^3 1/r=-3(5(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)^3/r^7-3(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^5),\n    \n    \u2202^4/\u2202 s^4 1/r   =   3(35(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)^4/r^9-30(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)^2/r^7+3/r^5).\n\n\nUsing these expressions in (<ref>) and defining r_g=2G M_\u2295/c^2, we have\n\n\n    2U_ E(b\u20d7,\u03c4)/c^2   =   \n    r_g {1/r-{J_2R^2_\u22951/2(3(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)^2/r^5-1/r^3)+\n    J_3R^3_\u22951/2(5(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)^3/r^7-3(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^5)+\n       +   \n    J_4R^4_\u22951/8(35(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)^4/r^9-30(s\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)^2/r^7+3/r^5)+\n    \u2211_\u2113=5^\u221e(-1)^\u2113/\u2113!

We substitute (<ref>) into expression (<ref>) and integrate it. As a result, we have the following expression for the gravitational phase shift induced by the lowest order gravitational multipoles, i.e., \u2113=0, 2,3,4:\n\n\n    \u03c6_G^ E(r\u20d7,r\u20d7_0)    =   \n    -k\u222b^\u03c4_\u03c4_02/c^2U_ E(\u03c4')d\u03c4' = -\n    kr_g {ln[r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r_0+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7_0)]+\n           -50pt + 1/2J_2R_\u2295^2 {(2(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2+(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2-1)\n    (1/r(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7))-1/b^2)+\n    ((s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2-(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2)(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^3+\n    2(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7) (s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)b/r^3}|^r_r_0-\n           -50pt - 1/3J_3R_\u2295^3 {\n    (s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)(4(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2+3(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2-3)\n    (1/b^3-1/br(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7))+1/2b(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^3)+\n    \n           -10pt + 3/2(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)\n    ((s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2-3(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2)b(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^5+\n    3/2(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)((s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2-3(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2)b^2/r^5+1/2(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)(3-5(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2)1/r^3}|^r_r_0\n    -\n           -50pt - 1/4J_4R_\u2295^4 {(8(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2((s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2+(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2-1)+((s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2-1)\n    ^2)(1/b^4-1/b^2r(r+(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7))+1/2b^2(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^3)+\n    \n           -10pt + (3(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2\n    ((s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2+(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2-1)+(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2\n    (3-4(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2))(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^5+\n           -10pt + 5/2(((s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2-(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2)^2-4(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2)b^2(k\u20d7\u00b7r\u20d7)/r^7+\n           -10pt + \n    10(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)((s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2-(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)^2)b^3/r^7+2(s\u20d7\u00b7m\u20d7)(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)(3-7(s\u20d7\u00b7k\u20d7)^2)b/r^5}|^r_r_0\n    + O(J_5)  }.\n\n\nNote that a similar result for the quadrupole J_2 term  was obtained in <cit.>. Expression (<ref>) extends all the previous computations to the higher order terms including J_4. In fact, this result is new. It generalizes a similar result obtained in <cit.> (see Appendix therein) that was derived  for all orders of the zonal harmonics, \u2113, in the case when the transmitter and receiver are a very larger distance from the gravitating body, b\u226a r.\n\n"}
