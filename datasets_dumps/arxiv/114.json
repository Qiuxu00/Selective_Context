We show that this model is a GUT and unifies the three SM gauge couplings and also the additional U(1)_3-4 coupling at a GUT scale of \u2248 5 \u00d7 10^16 GeV and explains the experimentally observed deviation of the muon g-2. We also fit the quark flavor changing processes consistent with the latest experimental data and look at the effect of the new particles on the W boson mass without obviously conflicting with the observed masses of particles, CKM matrix elements, neutrino mixing angles, their mass differences, and the lepton-flavor violating bounds. This model predicts sparticle masses less than 25 TeV, with a gluino mass \u2248 2.3 - 3 TeV consistent with constraints, and one of the neutralinos as the LSP with a mass of \u2248 480 - 580 GeV, which is a potential dark matter candidate. The model is string theory motivated and predicts the VL quarks, leptons, a massive Z' and two Dirac neutrinos at the TeV scale and the branching ratios of \u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3, \u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03b3 and \u03c4\u27f6 3\u03bc with BR(\u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3) within reach of future experiments.

However, one of the discrepancies between the Standard Model and the experimental measurement that has been known for a long time is the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The discrepancy between the SM prediction and the measured value is <cit.> :\n        \n            \u0394 a_\u03bc = a_\u03bc^exp - a_\u03bc^SM = 251(59) \u00d7 10^-11\n        \n        In addition to that, the b \u27f6 s l^+l^- transitions related to tests of lepton flavor non-universality in the observables R(K) and R(K^*)<cit.>, semi-leptonic branching ratios <cit.> and angular distributions <cit.> also showed deviations from the SM predictions. However, recent LHCb measurements <cit.> suggest that there is no lepton non-universality.\n        \n        It has been shown that an extension of the SM involving VL leptons that couple only with the muons can explain the discrepancy of the muon g - 2 <cit.>.\n         It has also been shown that both the muon g - 2 and the b \u27f6 s l^+l^- transitions related to tests of lepton flavor non-universality can be solved by introducing VL leptons, VL quarks and an additional massive Z' boson corresponding to the spontaneously broken U(1)_\u03bc - \u03c4<cit.>.  However, in light of the recent evidence for the absence of lepton flavor non-universality, it is most appropriate to fit all of the Wilson coefficients, resulting from beyond the Standard Model physics, C_9, C_10, C_9' and C_10' of the effective Hamiltonian <cit.>:\n        \n            \u210b_eff = -4G_F/\u221a(2)V_tbV_ts^*e^2/16 \u03c0^2\u2211_j = 9,10(C_j \ud835\udcaa_j + C'_j\ud835\udcaa'_j) + h.c.\n        \n        where\n        \n            \ud835\udcaa_9 = (s\u03b3_\u03bc P_L b)(\u03bc\u03b3^\u03bc\u03bc),  \ud835\udcaa'_9 = (s\u03b3_\u03bc P_R b)(\u03bc\u03b3^\u03bc\u03bc)\n        \n        and\n        \n            \ud835\udcaa_10 = (s\u03b3_\u03bc P_L b)(\u03bc\u03b3^\u03bc\u03b3_5 \u03bc),  \ud835\udcaa'_10 = (s\u03b3_\u03bc P_R b)(\u03bc\u03b3^\u03bc\u03b3_5 \u03bc)\n        \n        to zero. This is what will be realized in our analysis, where we fit all the four Wilson coefficients within a value of \u00b1 0.1.\n        \n        In addition, it was shown in <cit.> that an additional 4th family which is VL with respect to the SM but chiral with respect to the new spontaneously broken U(1)_3-4 symmetry solves the muon g - 2 anomaly without directly conflicting with experimental data. The analysis performed there, however, is restricted to the second and third  families and is non-supersymmetric. However, since string theory gives a supersymmetric theory,  in this paper, we generalize to include supersymmetry and present a complete analysis involving the three SM families and a VL-chiral family throughout. Finally, experimental evidence shows a deviation of the W boson mass from its value predicted by the SM <cit.>. It was shown in <cit.> that the W boson mass can be fit by considering VL leptons and an additional U(1) gauge group. In our analysis, we extend the model of <cit.> and also study the effect of the new vector-like chiral leptons of our model on the W boson mass.\n        \n        In our model, the third SM family, the left-handed VL family and their SUSY counterparts have charges +1 and -1 respectively under the new U(1)_3-4 gauge group and all other fermions and their sparticles are neutral. This model is motivated by heterotic string orbifold constructions <cit.> which give the full MSSM spectrum, states which are VL under the SM gauge group and chiral under new U(1)' gauge symmetries. In addition, there are many SM singlet scalars that break the additional gauge symmetries and give mass to the new vector bosons and the VL particles. In many previous constructions, the additional particles gained mass at the string scale; however, in this model, we consider the case when at least one of the families of the VL particles is light enough (\u223c 1 TeV), hence making it possible to observe them in future experiments. We consider the Lagrangian involving this additional VL family and the corresponding sparticles, but the higher mass modes predicted by string theory are assumed to be integrated out.\n        \n        It will be seen that the model simultaneously fits the observed quark and lepton masses of the three SM families, the Higgs mass, the strong and U(1)_em gauge couplings, the CKM matrix elements, and neutrino mass differences and mixing angles. It also fits the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the deviation of the W boson mass from its SM value without violating the data from quark flavor changing processes (i.e. Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) decay bounds) and the cosmological upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses, i.e. \u2211_i = 1^3m_\u03bd_i < 0.12 eV. The new VL leptons, VL quarks, Dirac neutrinos as well as the Z' boson all have mass\n         at the TeV scale. The model being supersymmetric predicts all the sparticle masses less than 25 TeV and also gives a \u2248 480 - 580 GeV neutralino, which is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) of the model and has the potential to be a dark matter candidate.\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \u00a7 MODEL\n        \n        The model under consideration is the MSSM with three right-handed neutrinos, one additional generation of left-handed and right-handed chiral fields, and their supersymmetric counterparts \u2013 which correspond to the VL particles. Further, we also have an additional U(1)_3-4 under which the third SM family and the left-handed chiral part of the fourth additional generation are charged. This U(1)_3-4 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by the nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the scalar components of the superfields \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0305. All the relevant scalar, fermionic fields of the model and their quantum numbers are given in terms of the superfields in the Table 1 below.\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        The superpotential relevant for our analysis is:\n        \n            \ud835\udcb2   = - u_iy^u_ijq_jH_u - d_iy^d_ijq_jH_d - e_iy^e_ijl_jH_d - \u03bd_iy^\u03bd_ijl_jH_u \n                - \u03bb_LRUU Q H_u -  \u03bb_LRDD Q H_d - \u03bb_LREE L H_d - \u03bb_LRNN L H_u \n                - \u03bb_RLUQ U H_d -  \u03bb_RLDQ D H_u - \u03bb_RLEL E H_u - \u03bb_RLNL N H_d \n                - \u03a6\u0305( \u03bb_3Q q^3 Q + \u03bb_UU U + \u03bb_DD D + \u03bb_3L l^3 L + \u03bb_EE E + \u03bb_NN N )\n               - \u03a6 (\u03bb_Q Q Q + \u03bb_3Uu^3 U + \u03bb_3Dd^3 D + \u03bb_L L L + \u03bb_3Ee^3 E + \u03bb_3N\u03bd^3 N) \n               - \u03bb_2Q_aQ q^a - \u03bb_2L_aL l^a - \u03bb_2U_au^a U - \u03bb_2D_ad^a D\n                - \u03bb_2E_ae^a E - \u03bb_2N_a\u03bd^a N - \u03bc H_u H_d - \u03bc_\u03a6\u03a6\u0305\u03a6\n        \n        where i,j = 1,2,3 and the Yukawa matrices y^u_ij, y^d_ij, y^e_ij and y^\u03bd_ij are block diagonal due to the constraint of the Lagrangian being invariant under the U(1)_3-4 gauge symmetry. Almost all of the Yukawa parameters are taken to be real. The Yukawa couplings y^d_12, y^d_21, y^d_22, y^u_33 = y^d_33 = y^e_33 (in the GUT sense) and \u03bb_3Q, \u03bb_3U and \u03bb_3D are taken to be complex to get the complex parameters in the CKM matrix. The 2\u22951 flavor structure of the SM families can, in principle, originate from a D_4 flavor symmetry <cit.>, however this is beyond the scope of the present paper.  The quantities {\u03bb_2Q_a, \u03bb_2L_a, \u03bb_2U_a, \u03bb_2D_a, \u03bb_2E_a, \u03bb_2N_a} are effective \u03bc-like parameters with mass dimension 1. We will present a detailed analysis of the flavor physics of all the three SM families. \n        \n        \n        We consider the generic soft SUSY breaking Lagrangian:\n        \n            \u2112_soft = -1/6h^ijk\u03d5_i \u03d5_j \u03d5_k - 1/2b^ij\u03d5_i \u03d5_j - 1/2 (m^2)^i_j \u03d5^*j\u03d5_i - 1/2M_a \u03bb_a \u03bb_a\n        \n        where the scalar fields \u03d5_i are the sparticle fields, the Higgs and new scalar fields of our model and the \u03bb_a are the four gaugino fields. The RG flow of the soft SUSY breaking sparticle and gaugino mass parameters have also been analyzed. We also consider Majorana neutrino mass terms in the superpotential, given by the addition of:\n        \n            \ud835\udcb2_maj = 1/2 M_L N N + 1/2 M_R^ab\u03bd\u0305^a \u03bd\u0305^b + M_R N\u0305\u03bd\u0305^3 .\n        \n        This then gives the Lagrangian terms for the fermions (in Dirac notation)\n        \n            \u2112_maj = -1/2M_L N_L^\ud835\udc9e N_L -1/2 M_R^ab( \u03bd\u0305_L^a)^\ud835\udc9e\u03bd\u0305_L^b - (M_R N\u0305_L^\ud835\udc9e\u03bd\u0305_L^3+h.c.) + h.c.\n        \n        We take the Majorana mass terms M_L, M_R, M_R^ab to be much larger than the VEVs  v_\u03a6, v_\u03a6\u0305 >  v_H_u, v_H_d. Hence, we can integrate out the heavy states. The details of this calculation are presented in [sec:7.1]Appendix \u00a0<ref>sec:7.1. After integrating out the heavy states, we get an effective Lagrangian given by:\n         \n            \u2112^eff   =  (l^d_L)^C (y^\u03bd_d e)^T H_u (M_R^-1)_e a y^\u03bd_db l^b_LH_u  +  1/M_R\u03bb_LRN  (y^\u03bd_33) (l^3_L)^C H_u  L_L H_u  \n                - L\u0305_L^C(  \u03bb_2L_a l_L^a + \u03bb_3 L\u03a6\u0305l^3_L + \u03bb_L \u03a6 L_L   ) +   1/M_L\u03bb_RLN\u03bb_RLNL\u0305_L^C H_d  L\u0305_L H_d  + h.c.\n        \n        This effective Lagrangian is considered for RG flow and for the physics below the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass scale.\n        \n        At the weak scale,  the scalar fields obtain vacuum expectation values and the above effective Lagrangian becomes:\n        \n            \u2112^eff   =  (l^d_L)^C\u00a0(y^\u03bd_d e)^T (M_R^-1)_e a y^\u03bd_db\u00a0l^b_L\u00a0v_H_u^2  +  1/M_R\u03bb_LRN  y^\u03bd_33\u00a0(l^3_L)^C\u00a0L_L \u00a0v_H_u^2   \n                - (N\u0305^'_L)^C(  \u03bb_2L_a\u03bd_L^a + \u03bb_3 L v_\u03a6\u0305\u03bd^3_L + \u03bb_L v_\u03a6\u00a0N^'_L ) - E\u0305^'_R (  \u03bb_2L_a e_L^a + \u03bb_3 L v_\u03a6\u0305 e^3_L + \u03bb_L v_\u03a6 E^'_L   ) \n               + 1/M_L\u03bb_RLN\u03bb_RLNL\u0305_L^CL\u0305_L \u00a0v_H_d^2 + h.c.\n        \n        There are only 5 light neutrino states at the weak scale. Of these, one linear combination of {\u03bd_L^1, \u00a0\u03bd_L^2, \u00a0\u03bd_L^3, \u00a0N^'_L} obtains mass at the heavier scale {\u223c v_\u03a6, v_\u03a6\u0305}.  This is a Dirac mass term and includes two Weyl spinors. The other 3 linear combinations only obtain mass at the scale of order v_H_u^2/M_R, etc.\n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Quark and charged lepton masses\n        \n        We can write the 5 \u00d7 5 Dirac mass matrices as:\n        \n            e_R \u2133^e e_L = (e_Ri\u00a0E_R \u00a0E'_R) [ v_H_dy^e_11 v_H_dy^e_12           0           0      \u03bb_2E_1; v_H_dy^e_21 v_H_dy^e_22           0           0      \u03bb_2E_2;           0           0 v_H_dy^e_33           0     v_\u03a6\u03bb_3E;           0           0           0  v_H_d\u03bb_LRE     v_\u03a6\u0305\u03bb_E;      \u03bb_2L_1      \u03bb_2L_2    v_\u03a6\u0305\u03bb_3L      v_\u03a6\u03bb_L  v_H_u\u03bb_RLE ][ e_Li; E'_L;  E_L ]\n        \n            u_R \u2133^u u_L = (u_RiU_R U'_R) [ v_H_uy^u_11 v_H_uy^u_12           0           0      \u03bb_2U_1; v_H_uy^u_21 v_H_uy^u_22           0           0      \u03bb_2U_2;           0           0 v_H_uy^u_33           0     v_\u03a6\u03bb_3U;           0           0           0  v_H_u\u03bb_LRU     v_\u03a6\u0305\u03bb_U;      \u03bb_2Q_1      \u03bb_2Q_2    v_\u03a6\u0305\u03bb_3Q      v_\u03a6\u03bb_Q  v_H_d\u03bb_RLU ][ u_Li; U'_L;  U_L ]\n        \n            d_R \u2133^d d_L = (d_RiD_R D'_R) [ v_H_dy^d_11 v_H_dy^d_12           0           0      \u03bb_2D_1; v_H_dy^d_21 v_H_dy^d_22           0           0      \u03bb_2D_2;           0           0 v_H_dy^d_33           0     v_\u03a6\u03bb_3D;           0           0           0  v_H_d\u03bb_LRD     v_\u03a6\u0305\u03bb_D;      \u03bb_2Q_1      \u03bb_2Q_2    v_\u03a6\u0305\u03bb_3Q      v_\u03a6\u03bb_Q  v_H_u\u03bb_RLD ][ d_Li; D'_L;  D_L ]\n        \n        where we have assumed the scalar VEVs to be real.

The weak scale CKM matrix for the two fit points can be found in [sec:7.6]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.6 and [sec:7.9]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.9.\n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Neutrino mixing angles and mass differences\n        \n        From the effective Lagrangian at the weak scale mentioned earlier, the mass matrix for the light neutrinos is given by:\n        \n            ( [  \u03bd_L^1 C  \u03bd_L^2 C  \u03bd_L^3 C  N_L^' C N\u0305_L^' C ]) ( [  ( y^\u03bd T (M_R^ab)^-1 y^\u03bd )_11 v_u^2  ( y^\u03bd T (M_R^ab)^-1 y^\u03bd )_12 v_u^2                                   0                                   0                              \u03bb_2L_1; ( y^\u03bd T (M_R^ab)^-1 y^\u03bd )_21  v_u^2  ( y^\u03bd T (M_R^ab)^-1 y^\u03bd )_22 v_u^2                                   0                                   0                              \u03bb_2L_2;                                   0                                   0                                   0               \u03bb_LRN y^\u03bd_33v_u^2/M_R                          \u03bb_3 L v_\u03a6\u0305;                                   0                                   0               \u03bb_LRN y^\u03bd_33v_u^2/M_R                                   0                             \u03bb_L v_\u03a6;                              \u03bb_2L_1                              \u03bb_2L_2                          \u03bb_3 L v_\u03a6\u0305                             \u03bb_L v_\u03a6                   \u03bb_RLN^2 v_d^2/M_L ])\n               ( [  \u03bd_L^1;  \u03bd_L^2;  \u03bd_L^3;  N_L^'; N\u0305_L^' ])\n        \n        The set of parameters for the two fit points has been given in [sec:7.5.2]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.5.2 and [sec:7.8.2]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.8.2. \n        \n        The neutrino mass matrix M_\u03bd can be diagonalized as follows:\n        \n            U_\u03bd^T M_\u03bd U_\u03bd = diag(m_\u03bd_1,m_\u03bd_3,m_\u03bd_3,m_\u03bd_4,m_\u03bd_5)\n        \n        From this, one can obtain the extended PMNS matrix given by:\n        \n            U_PMNS = (U_L^e)^\u2020 P_5\u0305 U_\u03bd\n        \n        As can be clearly seen from the above definition, the extended PMNS matrix is not unitary. The 3 \u00d7 3 submatrix of this extended PMNS matrix is the standard PMNS matrix. This is the same as saying that, the PMNS matrix is the matrix that diagonalizes the neutrino mass matrix when it is represented in the  basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal. The three mixing angles (sin^2\u03b8_12, sin^2\u03b8_23, sin^2\u03b8_13) can then be extracted from the PMNS matrix. The light neutrino masses are given by m_i = \u221a(m_v_i^* m_v_i) (i = 1,2,3) and we get 2 neutrinos with mass of order 1 TeV. From the masses of the three light neutrinos we can get the three mass differences \u0394 m^2_12, \u0394 m^2_23 and \u0394 m^2_13. We also get the CP violating phase \u03b4_CP and Jarlskog invariant defined by: \n        \n            J = Imag(U_PMNS^23 U_PMNS^13* U_PMNS^12 U_PMNS^22*)\n        \n        which is consistent with the 3\u03c3 confidence interval for \u03b4_CP found in <cit.>.\n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 RG flow of the U(1)_3-4  coupling g'\n        \n        We consider two loop RG equations for the gauge couplings and 1 loop RG equations for the Yukawa parameters and for the soft SUSY breaking dimensionful parameters - the sparticle mass parameters, gaugino mass paramaters and the parameter h^ijk. \n        \n        We have an additional constraint on the value of the g' coupling due to the presence of a Landau pole at high energies. The RGE of the coupling g' to 1-loop is given by:\n        \n            dg'/d ln\u03bc = g'^3/16\u03c0^2 (\u2211_i Q^'(i) - 3C(G))\n        \n        Here C(G) = 0 in our case, since G = U(1)_3-4\u2261 U(1)^'.  Q^'(i) is the U(1)^' charge. The sum is over all the supermultiplets which are charged under the U(1)_3-4 group. Hence, we get:\n        \n            dg'/d ln\u03bc = 34 g'^3/16\u03c0^2\n        \n        This implies:\n        \n            \u039b_g' = \u03bc_Z' exp(8\u03c0^2/34 g'(\u03bc_Z')^2)\n        \n        where \u039b_g' is the scale of the Landau pole. The plot for the scale of the Landau pole as a function of g'( \u223c 1 TeV) is given in Figure 1 above.\n        \n        For our case, we consider our model to hold true roughly up to M_GUT\u2248 5 \u00d7 10^16 GeV and consider \u03bc(Z') \u223c TeV scale, within reach of future experiments at the HL-LHC. This already gives a constraint g'(\u03bc_Z') < 0.271 for the U(1)_3-4 coupling in our model. It should be noted that this is an estimate obtained only from the 1 loop RG equations and not considering the 2 loop effects or the 1 loop threshold corrections, which is what we will be considering for a more detailed analysis.\n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Couplings of quarks and charged leptons with Z'\n        \n        The Lagrangian for the coupling of the quarks and charged leptons with the new Z' boson is given by:\n        \n            \u2112_Z' = g'Z'_\u03bc(f^a_L [g^f_L]_abf^b_L + f^a_R [g^f_R]_abf^b_R)\n        \n        where f = u,d,e and\n        \n            g^f_L = (U^f_L)^\u2020 g_L U^f_L,  g^f_R = (U^f_R)^\u2020 g_R U^f_R\n        \n        with the U(1)_3-4 charge matrices given by:\n        \n            g_L = g_R = diag(0,0,1,-1,0)\n        \n        In a completely analogous manner, the Z' gaugino similarly couples to the quarks, charged leptons and their sparticles. Since the structure of the Lagrangian is not different for them, we won't bother writing it down explicitly. It is worth noting that the Z' coupling is not symmetric in the 4 and the 4\u0305 families because of the difference in the U(1)_3-4 charges in the 4 and 4\u0305 families and the difference in the way the f_R and f_L are represented. The flavor-changing currents between the SM 1 and 2 families and the SM 2 and 3 families mediated by the Z' boson are small, leading to suppressed branching ratios for lepton flavor violating processes. This will be explicitly seen in the results of our model's analysis.\n        \n        \n        \n        \u00a7 OBSERVABLES\n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Masses of the particles\n        \n        We fit the SM quark and charged lepton masses by diagonalizing the 5 \u00d7 5 Dirac mass matrices mentioned in the previous section. The light SM neutrino masses are obtained as mentioned in the previous section. We get that U_\u03bd^T M_\u03bd U_\u03bd is approximately diagonal (with the non-diagonal entries being \u2272 0.01 times the diagonal ones) and the PMNS matrix being approximately unitary.\n        \n        The tree level W and Z boson masses are given by:\n        \n            M_W = 1/2vg_SU(2),  M_Z = 1/2v \u221a(g_SU(2)^2 + g_U(1)^2)\n        \n        where v is the Higgs VEV, g_SU(2) = g_2 and g_U(1) = \u221a(3/5)\u00a0 g_1. However, there are contributions of the new vector-like chiral leptons to the W boson mass, which cause the value of the W boson to deviate from the SM value. W boson mass corrections have been discussed in <cit.>. In our case, we consider the correction to W boson mass due to vector-like chiral leptons given by <cit.>:\n        \n            \u03b4 M_W^2/M_W^2|_SM\u2248\u03b1_e cos^2(\u03b8_W)/cos^2(\u03b8_W) - sin^2(\u03b8_W) T\n        \n        where the oblique parameter T is approximately given by:\n        \n            T \u22481/16 \u03c0 sin^2(\u03b8_W) cos^2(\u03b8_W)2(m_L^-^2 - m_L^0^2)^2/3 M_Z^2 M^2_L\n        \n        with M^2_L = \u03bb_L^2 v_\u03a6^2 + \u03bb_2L_1^2 + \u03bb_2L_2^2. The two fit points of our model predict a significant deviation of the W boson mass from its SM value. \n        \n        \n        The Higgs mass is given by:\n        \n            m^2_h^0 = 1/2(m^2_A^0 + m^2_Z - \u221a((m^2_A^0-m_Z^2)^2 + 4m^2_Zm^2_A^0sin^2(2\u03b2))) + \u0394(m^2_h^0)\n        \n        where \u0394(m^2_h^0) consists of the radiative corrections to the tree level Higgs mass. The precise expressions are given in detail in the [sec:7.2]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.2. \n        \n        The Z^' boson mass in our model is given by:\n        \n            M_Z^' = g^'\u221a(2(v_\u03a6^2 + v_\u03a6\u0305^2))\n        \n        Its value for the two fit points can be found in Table 4.\n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Masses of the sparticles\n        \n        We work in the Generalized Mirage Mediation (GMM) model <cit.> and set the boundary conditions for the sparticle and gaugino masses, and the trilinear soft coupling to be:\n        \n            M_a = M_s(l_a \u03b1 + b_a g_a^2)\n        \n            A_ijk = M_s(-a_ijk\u03b1 + \u03b3_i + \u03b3_j + \u03b3_k)\n        \n            m^2_i = M_s^2(c_i \u03b1^2 + 4\u03b1\u03be_i - \u03b3_i)\n        \n        where M_s = m_3/2/16\u03c0^2 (m_3/2 is the gravitino mass), b_a are the gauge \u03b2 function coefficients for the gauge group a and g_a are the corresponding gauge couplings and \u03be_i = \u2211_j,k a_ijky_ijk^2/4 - \u2211_a l_a g_a^2 C^a_2(f_i) with C^a_2(f_i) being the quadratic Casimir for the a'th gauge group corresponding to the representation to which the sfermion f_i belongs. The anomalous dimension \u03b3_i and \u03b3_i = 8\u03c0^2\u2202\u03b3_i/\u2202 log\u03bc is given by:\n        \n            \u03b3_i = 2\u2211_a g_a^2 C^a_2(f_i) - \u2211_y_i |y_i|^2\n        \n            \u03b3_i = 2\u2211_a g_a^4 b_a C^a_2(f_i) - \u2211_y_i |y_i|^2 b_y_i\n        \n        We consider a universal parameter a_ijk = a_0 and a universal c_i = c_m for all the sparticles except for m^2_H_u and m^2_H_d for which we consider the coefficients c_H_u and c_H_d. Hence the input parameters for these soft SUSY breaking sector include M_s, l_a, \u03b1, a_0, c_m, c_H_u and c_H_d. The values for these input parameters at the GUT scale are mentioned in [sec:7.5.3]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.5.3 and [sec:7.8.3]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.8.3.\n        The sparticle masses predicted by the model are all less than 25 TeV. The gluino mass is \u223c\u00a0 2.3 - 3 TeV and satisfies the bound > 1.9 TeV. The VL particle and the Z' masses are all of the \u223c TeV scale within reach of future experiments. The neutralino and chargino masses are found by diagonalizing the 7 \u00d7 7 and 2 \u00d7 2 matrices given in the [sec:7.3]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.3.\n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Lepton Non-Universality\n        \n        Our model gives rise to Lepton Non-Universality in the operators \ud835\udcaa_i = 9,10 and \ud835\udcaa'_i = 9,10.

The relevant Wilson coefficients have been calculated by using the g matrices in [sec:7.7]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.7 and [sec:7.10]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.10 for the two fit points I and II respectively. Recent results <cit.> suggest that the rare B decay anomalies found earlier are not present and hence in this scenario, we must fit the Wilson coefficients to C^\u03bc_9, C^\u03bc_10, C^'^\u03bc_9 and C^'^\u03bc_10 to approximately zero. This is realized in our model where we fit them to 0.0 \u00b1 0.1.\n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Electric dipole moment of the muon\n        \n        Following <cit.>, the muon electric dipole moment is given by:\n        \n            d_\u03bc = d^h_\u03bc + d^Z_\u03bc + d^W_\u03bc\n        \n        where\n        \n            d^h_\u03bc = - \u221a(4\u03c0\u03b1_e)/16\u03c0^2 M_Higgs^2\u2211_i = 2,4,5 Im(\u03bb_i2\u03bb_2i) m_i g_h(r_i)\n        \n        where r_i = m_i^2/M_Higgs^2 and \u03bb_ij are the Yukawa couplings between the charged leptons f_i and f_j.

Since we are working in the large tan\u03b2 regime, there might be sizeable contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon from the Higgs. Moreover, there are SUSY contributions to the muon g - 2 as well and the Z' contribution can be sizeable due to the off-diagonal muon-Z' couplings to the VL leptons which contribute significantly to the muon g - 2 loop.\n        \n        The leading order contribution to the muon g - 2 is then given by:\n        \n            \u0394 a_\u03bc = \u0394 a_\u03bc^Z' + \u0394 a_\u03bc^Higgs + \u0394 a_\u03bc^SUSY\n        \n        where the leading order contribution to the muon g - 2 arising from the Z' coupling to leptons is given by (for example <cit.>):\n        \n            \u0394 a_\u03bc^Z' = - g^'^2m_\u03bc^2/8 \u03c0^2 M_Z'^2\u2211_a[(|[g^e_L]_2a|^2 + |[g^e_R]_2a|^2)F(x_a) + Re([g^e_L]_2a[g^e*_R]_2a) m_a/m_\u03bcG(x_a)]\n        \n        where x_a = (m_a/M_Z')^2 and\n        \n            F(x) = (5x^4 - 14x^3 + 39x^2 - 38x - 18x^2ln(x) + 8)/(12 (1 - x)^4)\n        \n            G(x) = (x^3 + 3x - 6xln(x) - 4)/(2 (1 - x)^3)\n        \n        and the Higgs contribution is given by <cit.>:\n        \n            \u0394 a_\u03bc^Higgs\u2248 21+tan^2\u03b2/16\u03c0^2m_\u03bc m_\u03bc^LE/v^2\n        \n        where\n        \n            m_\u03bc^LE = \u03bb_2L_2\u03bb_2E_2\u03bb_RLE/m_E_1m_E_2 v_H_u\n        \n        and the SUSY contributions to the muon g - 2 are as given in <cit.>. In our analysis, we have found fit points with \u03bb_2E_2 = 0 and hence, this gives a vanishing value of \u0394 a_\u03bc^Higgs. The \u0394 a_\u03bc^SUSY in our model are also smaller than the \u0394 a_\u03bc^Z' and the muon g - 2 is hence dominated by \u0394 a_\u03bc^Z'. It is worth mentioning that one might also solve the muon g - 2 anomaly by making \u03bb_2E_2\u223c\u03bb_2L_2 but keeping \u03bb_RLE small enough (of the order of 10^-6). In such scenarios, the muon g - 2 is dominated by \u0394 a_\u03bc^Higgs and the contribution of \u0394 a_\u03bc^Z' is much smaller in these cases.\n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Lepton Flavor violating processes\n        \n        The new Z' coupling induces the Lepton flavor violating decays \u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3, \u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03b3 and \u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc. Apart, from this, there are also dominant SUSY contributions to BR(\u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3) and BR(\u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03b3).

The analysis has been performed by considering the two-loop RG equations for the gauge couplings and their one-loop threshold corrections and one-loop RG equations for the Yukawa parameters and the soft SUSY breaking parameters by analytically deriving the RG equations for this supersymmetric \"VL-chiral\" model from the most general expressions in <cit.>. We start with the 1-loop RG flow of the gauge couplings and find the value of the unified coupling \u03b1_unif at \u2248 5 \u00d7 10^16 GeV and then choose the mirage mediation boundary condition parameters and some initial guess for the Yukawa parameters and RG flow these parameters down to the weak scale via 2-loop RG equations for the gauge couplings and 1-loop RG equations for all the other parameters. The coupled differential RG equations are solved using . We also require precise\n        gauge coupling unification with \u03f5_3 = 0.\n        \n        With the weak scale results at hand, the value of \u03b1_GUT at the GUT scale and the GMM model parameters are then varied to get weak scale gauge couplings that are approximately close to the experimental values. Then the GUT scale Yukawa parameters are varied to fit the low energy observables approximately.\n        \n        Following that, a \u03c7^2 function is constructed with the GUT scale parameters taken to be those found out from the previous analysis, which are known to give approximately good results at the weak scale. Then  is used to minimize the \u03c7^2 function and due to limited computing power, the code was terminated when the results were seen to saturate to particular values. The resulting input array then gives the set of GUT scale parameters of the theory. For the neutrino sector analysis, since we have integrated out the massive states at a mass scale of \u2248 10^12 GeV, from this point to the weak scale, we RG flow the Weinberg operator along with the other parameters by using the expressions analogous to the one in <cit.> from which we extract the neutrino mixing angles and mass differences and include them in the \u03c7^2 minimization procedure. It should be noted that all the couplings associated with the neutrino fields (which are integrated out), have been set to zero while RG flowing the other parameters from the Majorana mass scale to the weak scale. For example, the yukawa couplings y^\u03bd, \u03bb_LRN, \u03bb_RLN, \u03bb_N and \u03bb_3N are all set to zero. Hence the coupled differential RG equations are solved twice with appropriate initial conditions, once as we go down from the GUT scale to the Majorana scale and then again as we go down from the Majorana scale to the weak scale. It is also worth mentioning that the neutrino sector observables (mass differences and mixing angles) can be entirely controlled by changing the neutrino sector parameters: especially the parameters in the matrix y^\u03bd_ij, \u03bb_LRN and the mass parameters that go into the Majorana Lagrangian. Moreover, since these above-mentioned Yukawa parameters are not exceedingly large, changing them by reasonable amounts (roughly by 1 %, say) does not affect the RG flow of the other Yukawa parameters much and hence keeps the other low energy observables unchanged. Hence, we expect that the neutrino sector low energy observables can be easily controlled by varying only these parameters and they are sufficient to explain the low energy neutrino sector observables without affecting the other observables significantly.\n        \n        We find two fit points that fit the low energy observables and reasonably different BR(\u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3). Hence, we simultaneously fit the CKM matrix, masses of the charged leptons and quarks at the weak scale, neutrino mixing angles, their mass differences, the strong and U(1)_em gauge couplings, and the Higgs mass. We solve for the muon g - 2 and also see that the W boson mass deviates from its SM value, without violating the experimental bounds of the electric dipole moments, the LFV processes \u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3, \u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03b3, \u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc, the quark flavor changing processes B_s \u27f6\u03bc^+ \u03bc^-, K_L \u27f6\u03bc^+ \u03bc^-, B_s \u27f7B\u0305_s and the upper bound of 0.12 eV for \u2211_i=1^3 m_\u03bd_i obtained from cosmological observations.\n        \n        The input parameters that are being varied in our \u03c7^2 analysis can be found in [sec:7.5]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.5 and [sec:7.8]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.8, and the observables that are being fitted can be found in Table 2 and Table 3. Since there are more input parameters than there are observables to fit, the possibility of another point in parameter space which can fit the low energy observables with different predictions is not excluded.\n        \n        \n        \n        \u00a7 RESULTS\n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Low energy observables\n        \n        \n        All the gauge couplings and the Yukawa parameters satisfy g < 1.5 and \u03b1_y = Y^2/4\u03c0\u2272 0.7 from the weak scale up to the GUT scale and hence the theory is perturbative up to the GUT scale. At the GUT scale, we have also imposed y_t = y_b = y_\u03c4 consistent with grand unification at the GUT scale.[y_\u03bd_\u03c4 would also be equal in SO(10).] An interesting observation which can be made from the values of these couplings at the weak scale (See [sec:7.5]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.5 and [sec:7.8]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.8) is that although the values of these couplings have a different magnitude, the phases associated with these three parameters are the same, even at the weak scale.\n        \n        We have found two points in the parameter space which give very good fits for the CKM matrix, quark, lepton, Higgs mass, neutrino mass differences, mixing angles and the strong and U(1)_em gauge couplings. From the results of the mass squared differences, we can also see that the model favors normal ordering over inverted ordering for neutrino masses. The quark and lepton masses of the three SM families have been fit by following the precise values of the running mass parameters obtained at the M_Z scale as in <cit.>. The total number of input parameters in the model is 63 and the total number of fitted low-energy observables is 46.  It might be possible to reduce the number of input parameters with some\n        symmetry relations.   This is however outside the scope of the present paper.\n        \n        The Wilson coefficients relevant for lepton non-universality in B decays are fit to \u2248 0 consistent with <cit.>. It is worth mentioning that the Wilson coefficients are sensitive to the coupling \u03bb_3Q in a way that changing this parameter slightly, doesn't affect the CKM matrices or weak scale masses much, however, it leads to a change in the value of C^\u03bc_9 that might deviate significantly from the  value we are interested in. The reality of the Wilson coefficients can also be controlled reasonably by the real and imaginary parts of the Yukawa parameter \u03bb_3Q which determines the coupling of the 3rd SM family quark doublet and the 4\u0305 quark doublet. The fit points also explain the muon g - 2 anomaly and satisfy the experimental bounds of the LFV and quark flavor changing processes, and give the BR(\u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3) within reach of future experiments. Note that the fit point predictions for BR(\u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3) range from \ud835\udcaa(10^-15) to \ud835\udcaa(10^-13) and one of these predictions is very close to the present experimental bound on BR(\u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3). It is worth mentioning that BR(\u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3) can be varied easily by changing the sparticle masses, i.e. by changing m_3/2 and c_m parameters within the GMM model.\n        \n        The loop contributions to the muon g - 2 from Z, W, and Higgs are very close to their SM values while the Z^' exchange with VL leptons in the loop completely accounts for the anomaly. These good fits can be obtained by considering a point in the parameter space with \u03bb_3E = \u03bb_3L = \u03bb_3N = 0 that is, by turning off the interactions between the SM 3rd family leptons with the 4\u0305 leptons at the GUT scale. At the weak scale as well, these parameters have values of 0 for the two fit points as can be clearly seen from the weak scale Yukawa matrices given in [sec:7.5]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.5 and [sec:7.8]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.8. However, it is worth noting that the BR(\u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03b3) and BR(\u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc) are sensitive to these couplings and changing them to 10^-6, say leads to an enhancement of BR(\u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03b3) and BR(\u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc) probably within reach of future experiments.\n        \n        Points in the parameter space with slight perturbations of the input parameters considered will all flow towards the GUT scale parameters for which we have performed the analysis after \u03c7^2 minimization. The Higgs mass is fine-tuned by varying the GMM parameters c_H_u and c_H_d at the GUT scale and leading order radiative corrections from the top, stop loops, and loops of the VL particles to the Higgs mass have been considered. It is natural to expect the requirement of some fine-tuning for the Higgs mass since the sparticle and gaugino masses are all of the order of 1 - 30 TeV which is necessary if we want to satisfy the gluino mass bound and BR(\u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3) within the Generalized Mirage Mediation model. As a passing note, it is also worth mentioning that scaling v_\u03a6, v_\u03a6\u0305 and the effective \u03bc-like dimension 1 parameters by the same factor keeps the CKM matrix and the SM quark and lepton masses almost unchanged. Also, \u03bb_2N_1 and \u03bb_2N_2 do not appear in our analysis and are hence unconstrained.\n        \n        The model also predicts masses of the VL leptons and quarks satisfying the experimental bounds and within reach of future experiments. The additional Z' gauge boson and also the two Dirac neutrinos have a TeV scale mass. All the computed and experimental values of all the low energy observables (fitted and unfitted) have been presented in the Table 2,  Table 3 and Table 4  below. The model also gives sin^2(\u03b8_W) = 0.23716 (for fit point I) and sin^2(\u03b8_W) = 0.23740 (for fit point II) which are around 2.7% different from the experimental value of 0.23121. It is worth mentioning that the Leading Logarithmic Threshold (LLT) approximation used in calculating the threshold corrections for \u03b1_1 and \u03b1_2, which were then used to calculate sin^2(\u03b8_W), is not consistent since the SU(2)_L \u00d7 U(1)_Y symmetry is broken at a scale comparable to the scale at which we have integrated out the masses. Due to this symmetry breaking, we think of our model as the effective theory above the M_Z scale and the SU(3)_C \u00d7 U(1)_em as the effective theory below the M_Z scale which allows us to consistently fit the gauge couplings \u03b1_3 and \u03b1_em and gives us a small theoretical uncertainty \u223c 2.7 % in the calculation of sin^2(\u03b8_W). \n        The Z boson mass is obtained from its tree level expression and is within 1 - 3% of the experimental value. The Higgs mass has been fine tuned within the 1\u03c3 bound of the experimental value. \n        \n        Under RG flow, the m^2_\u03a6 and m^2_\u03a6\u0305 parameters are run down to negative values at the weak scale. However, even in that case, the parameters m^2_\u03a6 + |\u03bc_\u03a6|^2 and m^2_\u03a6\u0305 + |\u03bc_\u03a6|^2 that appear in the classical potential for the new scalar fields are positive and satisfy the condition of (b_\u03a6\u03bc_\u03a6)^2 > (m^2_\u03a6 + \u03bc_\u03a6^2)(m^2_\u03a6\u0305 + \u03bc_\u03a6^2) for U(1)^' symmetry breaking. The respective values of m^2_\u03a6 and m^2_\u03a6\u0305 at the weak scale are given by -211.47 TeV^2 and -98.745 TeV^2 for the fit point I and -549.88 TeV^2 and -336.16 TeV^2 for the fit point II respectively.\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        We see that the two fit points fit the known experimental low energy data pretty nicely with  \u03c7^2 values of 23.02 and 21.54 if one considers the W boson mass measurement of <cit.> and \u03c7^2 values of 43.91 and 41.32 for the recent W boson mass measurements <cit.>. Thus we are not able to fit the new W mass measurement. They also solve the muon g - 2 with all Wilson coefficients consistent with recent experimental data. Moreover, as can be seen in Table 4 below, the new VL quarks and leptons predicted by the model all have masses at the TeV scale consistent with the experimental bounds in <cit.> and <cit.>. The new Z' gauge boson and the two Dirac neutrinos also have a mass of \u2248 1 TeV and hence all these particles are within reach of future experiments. The model also predicts a value of sin(\u03b4_CP) = -0.622 and the Jarlskog invariant J = -0.0276 for the fit point I and sin(\u03b4_CP) = -0.681 and the Jarlskog invariant J = -0.0277 for the fit point II, consistent with the 3\u03c3 confidence interval of \u03b4_CP\u2208 [-3.41, -0.03] found in <cit.>. \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 SUSY mass spectrum\n        \n        Our model predicts all the SUSY particles to have masses less than 25 TeV. The sparticle mass parameters for all quarks and leptons have been presented in the [sec:7.5.3]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.5.3 and [sec:7.8.3]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.8.3. We consider the Generalized Mirage Mediation (GMM) model and choose a universal c_m for all the sparticle mass parameters except the c_H_u and c_H_d Higgs parameters. With this choice, the RG flow of these mass parameters can be analyzed for the squarks and sleptons and it can be seen how they vary as the energy scale is reduced. \n        \n        Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the RG flows (for fit points I and II respectively) of the sparticle mass parameters m_squarks and m_sleptons from the GUT scale (which is \u2248 5 \u00d7 10^16 GeV) to the weak scale M_Z. We have plotted the sparticle mass parameters for the 3rd, 4, and 4\u0305 families. Despite the messy appearance, they tell us that on average, the squark mass parameters grow much faster as compared to the slepton mass parameters, and hence, on average, the values of the squark mass parameters are more than that of the slepton mass parameters at the weak scale M_Z. This is similar to what happens in the MSSM. We can see that the soft SUSY breaking mass parameters are all less than 24 TeV and, since the VL quark and lepton masses are less than 5 TeV, the scalar sparticle masses of all the squarks and sleptons are less than 25 TeV.\n        \n        We have also plotted the RG flow of the gaugino mass parameters M_a in Figure 4 and Figure 5 for fit points I and II respectively. The plots show an important difference between the MSSM and our supersymmetric model: Along with the gaugino mass parameters for the U(1) and SU(2) gauge groups, we see that the gluino mass parameter also decreases as we RG flow to the weak scale. This is however expected because unlike the MSSM, the strong SU(3) coupling increases with energy as can be seen in Figure 6 in the Appendix.[Note, we have demanded precise gauge coupling unification in our analysis.]  The new Z' gaugino corresponding to the additional U(1)^' is the LSP of the model. From the plots, we see that the gaugino mass parameters (especially M_1, M_2 and M^') sharply fall from > 4 TeV to less than 1 TeV as we RG flow from the GUT scale to the weak scale. The fall is the sharpest for the gaugino mass parameter M^'. The model also predicts a gluino mass m_gluino = 2.3749 TeV for the fit point I and m_gluino = 3.0332 TeV for the fit point II, both of which are consistent with the constraint m_gluino\u2273 1.9 TeV.\n        \n        The chargino and neutralino masses, calculated by diagonalizing the neutralino mass matrices given in the [sec:7.3]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.3, are summarized in Table 5. We see that the two fit points give a light neutralino mass ranging from \u2248 480 - 580 GeV. From the SUSY mass spectrum, i.e., the sparticle mass parameters and the chargino, neutralino masses, we get that this neutralino is indeed the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) which makes it possible for this neutralino to be the dark matter candidate.\n        \n        \n        \u00a7 CONCLUSION\n        \n        In this paper, we have studied the Standard Model extended by including supersymmetry and a complete family of vector-like fermions, including right-handed neutrinos which are vector-like with respect to the Standard Model gauge group. In addition to that, we have introduced a new U(1)_3-4\u2261 U(1)^' gauge group under which the third SM family of quarks and leptons has a U(1)_3-4 charge of 1 while the left chiral part of the 4th family has a charge of -1. This model is also free of gauge anomalies. In this paper, we have considered a complete supersymmetric analysis of the 4^th vector-like chiral family along with the 3 SM families.\n        \n        Our supersymmetric model unifies the four gauge couplings at M_GUT\u2248 5 \u00d7 10^16 GeV. We have also shown that our model can explain the anomalies in g - 2 without conflicting with other low-energy experimental data. The model also predicts the new VL quarks, leptons, 2 Dirac neutrinos and the Z^' gauge boson to have a mass at the TeV scale and also predicts the branching ratios of \u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3, \u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03b3 and \u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc with \u03bc\u27f6 e \u03b3 within the reach of future experiments, but with BR(\u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03b3) and BR(\u03c4\u27f6\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc) highly suppressed.\n        \n        \n        \n        The model predicts a mass spectrum of the supersymmetric particles with all sparticle masses < 25 TeV and also gives a light neutralino \u2248 480 GeV for the fit point I and \u2248 578 GeV for the fit points II, which is a potential dark matter candidate. Hence, we can see that indeed the \"vector-like chiral\" model of <cit.> can be made into a supersymmetric grand-unified model which not only solves the muon anomalies but also explains the deviation of other low energy data from the values predicted by the Standard Model. Moreover, the model predictions and the explained anomalies are not sensitive to the neutrino sector parameters and reasonable changes to these parameters do not change the model predictions and the low energy observables of the other sectors significantly. Hence, we do not rule out the possibility that our model predictions and results might also be obtained by a different fit point with reasonably different neutrino sector Yukawa and mass parameters.\n        \n        \n        \n        \u00a7 APPENDIX\n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Gauge coupling unification\n        \n        Our model unifies the 4 gauge couplings of the SU(3)_C \u00d7 SU(2)_L \u00d7 U(1)_Y \u00d7 U(1)_3-4 at a GUT scale of M_G \u2248 5 \u00d7 10^16 GeV. The plot for the two-loop RG flow of the 4 gauge couplings is shown in the Figure 6.\n        \n        At the GUT scale M_G, we have:\n        \n            \u03b1_G = \u03b1_1(M_G) = \u03b1_2(M_G),  \u03f5_3 = \u03b1_3(M_G) - \u03b1_G/\u03b1_G\n        \n        where the parameter \u03f5_3 in our model is zero, consistent with the expectation when SU(5) gauge group is broken down to SM gauge group via a Wilson line in an extra dimension. The model achieves unification of all the 4 gauge couplings at M_G and additionally solves the low energy anomalies. Since the RG flow analysis is at the two-loop level, we also consider one-loop threshold corrections to get the gauge couplings actually observed at low energies:\n        \n            1/\u03b1_i(M_Z)_MS = 1 - \u03b1_i(M_Z)_DR\u0394\u03b1_i/\u03b1_i(M_Z)_DR + C_2(G_i)/12\u03c0\n        \n        where C_2(G_i) = N for SU(N) and = 0 for U(1). \u0394\u03b1_i is the threshold correction to the \u03b1_i(M_Z)_DR that depends on the sparticle and VL particle masses at the weak scale primarily. With the 2 loop RG equations and 1 loop threshold corrections taken into account, it gives the value of g' at the weak scale to be 0.2673 for fit point I and 0.2680 for fit point II. This is consistent with the bound of g^' < 0.271 found from the 1 loop RG equations.\n        \n        It is also worth noting that, in contrary to the SM and the MSSM, the g_3 coupling of SU(3)_C in this model is not asymptotically free and instead increases with energy, much like the other three gauge couplings.\n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 Integrating out the heavy neutrino states\n        \n        From the Lagrangian of our model, we can integrate out the heavy states.

In this regime, we get |\u03bc|^2 at the tree level as:\n        \n            |\u03bc|^2 = 1/2(-2m^2_H_u - m_Z^2 + 2/tan^2\u03b2(m^2_H_d - m^2_H_u))\n        \n        However, in our analysis, we consider radiative corrections to the Z boson mass, which reduces the \u03bc further to approximately give:\n        \n            |\u03bc|^2 \u2248 -m^2_H_u - m_Z^2/2 - \u03a3_u^u\n        \n        where \u03a3^u_u corresponds to the radiative corrections and its exact expression is given in the Appendix of <cit.>. We also consider the contribution of the VL squarks along with those mentioned in <cit.>.\n        Including the large radiative corrections from top quark, top squark <cit.> and VL particle masses <cit.>, the Higgs mass is given by:\n        \n            m^2_h^0 = 1/2(m^2_A^0 + m^2_Z - \u221a((m^2_A^0-m_Z^2)^2 + 4m^2_Zm^2_A^0sin^2(2\u03b2))) + \u0394_t(m^2_h^0) + \u0394_VL(m^2_h^0)\n        \n        where\n        \n            \u0394_t(m^2_h^0) = 3/4\u03c0^2cos^2\u03b1 |y_t|^2 m_t^2 [ln(m_t_1m_t_2/m_t^2)] + \u0394_threshold\n        \n        with\n        \n            \u0394_threshold = c_t^2s_t^2[(m^2_t_2 - m^2_t_1)/m_t^2]ln(m^2_t_2/m^2_t_1) + c_t^4s_t^4[(m^2_t_2 - m^2_t_1)^2 - 1/2(m_t_2^4 - m_t_1^4)ln(m^2_t_2/m^2_t_1)]/m_t^4\n        \n        and\n        \n            \u0394_VL(m^2_h^0) \u2248 -3v^2/48 \u03c0^2|\u03bb_RLU|^4 |\u03bc|^4/m_S_U^4 - 3v^2/48 \u03c0^2|\u03bb_RLD|^4 |\u03bc|^4/m_S_D^4\n        \n        because in our model we have |\u03bb_RLU| > |\u03bb_LRU| and |\u03bb_RLD| > |\u03bb_LRD|. \n        \n        The angle \u03b1 is determined by:\n        \n            tan(2\u03b1)/tan(2\u03b2) = m^2_A^0 + m_Z^2/m^2_A^0 - m_Z^2\n        m_t_1 and m_t_2 are the top squark masses, m_S_U and m_S_D is the scale of VL scalar stop and sbottom masses and m^2_A^0 = 2|\u03bc|^2 + m^2_H_u + m^2_H_d. \n        \n        \n        With tan\u03b2\u223c 47.6, this model gives a reasonable \u03bc\u2248 13.6 TeV for the fit point I and  \u03bc\u2248 22.1 TeV for the fit point II. The Higgs mass can be easily fine tuned by varying c_H_u and c_H_d appropriately.\n        \n        \n        \n         \u00a7.\u00a7 The potential for the new scalar fields and self-consistency equations\n        \n        The classical scalar potential for the \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0305 fields is given by:\n        \n            V(\u03a6, \u03a6\u0305) = (|\u03bc_\u03a6|^2 + m^2_\u03a6)|\u03a6|^2 + (|\u03bc_\u03a6|^2 + m^2_\u03a6\u0305)|\u03a6\u0305|^2 - (b_\u03a6\u03bc_\u03a6\u03a6\u03a6\u0305+ c.c) + 1/2g^'^2(|\u03a6|^2 - |\u03a6\u0305|^2)^2\n        \n        It can be easily seen that this potential is indeed bounded from below. To see this, note that, except for the D-flat directions i.e. when |\u03a6| \u2260 |\u03a6\u0305|, the above potential is clearly bounded from below since the term quartic in fields dominates for large values of |\u03a6| and |\u03a6\u0305|. Now if |\u03a6| = |\u03a6\u0305|, then the condition for V(\u03a6, \u03a6\u0305) to be bounded from below is given by:\n        \n            2|\u03bc_\u03a6|^2 + m_\u03a6^2 + m_\u03a6\u0305^2 > 2 b_\u03a6\u03bc_\u03a6\n        \n        Minimizing the scalar potential:\n        \n            \u2202 V/\u2202\u03a6 = \u2202 V/\u2202\u03a6\u0305 = 0\n        \n        at v_\u03a6 and v_\u03a6\u0305 and considering real VEVs v_\u03a6, v_\u03a6\u0305, we get the two self-consistency equations:\n        \n            (|\u03bc_\u03a6|^2 + m^2_\u03a6)v_\u03a6 - b_\u03a6\u03bc_\u03a6 v_\u03a6\u0305 - g^'^2 v_\u03a6(v_\u03a6\u0305^2 - v_\u03a6^2) = 0\n        \n        and\n        \n            (|\u03bc_\u03a6|^2 + m^2_\u03a6\u0305)v_\u03a6\u0305 - b_\u03a6\u03bc_\u03a6 v_\u03a6 + g^'^2 v_\u03a6\u0305(v_\u03a6\u0305^2 - v_\u03a6^2) = 0\n        \n        With \u03bc_\u03a6 = 19.8232 TeV and b_\u03a6 = 11.6600 TeV for the fit point I and \u03bc_\u03a6 = 29.9013 TeV and b_\u03a6 = 14.6578 TeV for the fit point II, the above two self-consistency equations are satisfied with VEVs v_\u03a6 and v_\u03a6\u0305 mentioned in the [sec:7.5]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.5 and [sec:7.8]Appendix\u00a0<ref>sec:7.8 for the two fit points respectively.
