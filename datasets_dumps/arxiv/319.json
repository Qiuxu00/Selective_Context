In particular, we consider the estimate of the curl-free part of the solution to the linearised equations, in the homogeneous case.\n        We prove that our estimate is optimal in the L^\u221e-norm by showing that the norm is bounded from below by the same decay rate. \n        \n        \n        \n        \u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        This paper is concerned with the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes system\n        \n            _t \u03c1 + \u00f7 (\u03c1 u) = 0,     in  (0,\u221e) \u00d7^3, \n            _t (\u03c1 u) + \u00f7 (\u03c1 u \u2297 u) - \u00f7(2 \u03bc D(u) + \u03bb\u00f7 (u) Id) + \u2207 p = 0,     in  (0,\u221e) \u00d7^3, \n            \n                (\u03c1, u) |_t=0 = (\u03c1_0, u_0),     in ^3,\n        \n        where \u03c1 : [0,\u221e) \u00d7^3 \u2192 [0,\u221e), and u: [0,\u221e) \u00d7^3 \u2192^3 are unknown functions, representing the density and velocity of a fluid, respectively. \n        p: [0,\u221e) \u00d7^3 \u2192 is the pressure in the fluid, and the barotropic assumption gives us p  p(\u03c1), for some smooth function p(\u00b7).\n        \u03bc,\u03bb are viscosity coefficients, taken such that\n        \n            \u03bc > 0,    2\u03bc + \u03bb > 0.\n        \n        We define the deformation tensor\n        \n            D(u) 1/2( Du + Du^T ).\n        \n        \n        \n        In this paper, we examine the large-time behaviour, particularly time-decay estimates, of solutions to a linearised version of the above problem.\n        Matsumura-Nishida showed in\u00a0matsumura-nishida1979, matsumura-nishida1980 that (<ref>) has global solutions when equipped with data (\u03c1_0, u_0) that is a small perturbation in L^1 \u2229 H^3 of (\u03c1\u0305, 0) for any positive constant \u03c1\u0305, and proved the following decay result\n        \n            [ \u03c1(t) - \u03c1\u0305;      u(t) ]_2\u2264 C (1+t)^-3/4.\n        \n        This is the decay rate of the solution to the heat equation with initial data in L^1.\n        Ponce then extended these results to other L^p norms.

Assume that \n            \n            E [ a_0; m_0 ]_1\n                +\n                [ a_0; m_0 ]_H^ 1 + l\n        \n            is sufficiently small, where l\u22653 is an integer.\n        Then the Navier-Stokes system (<ref>) with initial data \u03c1_0, u_0 has a global solution satisfying the following decay estimate for all  for any multi-index  with || \u2264 (l-3)/2:\n        \n            D^_x [            a(t); m(t) - e^t\u0394 m_0 ]_p\n                    \u2264\n                    C(l) E (1+t)^ - 3/2 (1-1/p)  - 1/2 ( 1 - 2/p )   - ||/2.\n        \n        Note that, in the norm in the above inequality, we are removing the divergence-free part of the linear term of m. Thus what remain are the nonlinear term and the curl-free part of the linear term.\n        \n        \n        Kobayashi-Shibata in <cit.> also obtain the above decay rate. In fact, they obtained a refined estimate that requires less regularity on the initial data and separates the solution into high and low frequencies (see Definition <ref> below).\n        The above decay rate found in <cit.> is associated with the low-frequency part of solutions, while the high-frequency part decays exponentially with t.\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        In what follows, we shall assume that the density approaches 1 at infinity; and so we are concerned with strong solutions which are small perturbations from a constant state (\u03c1,u) \u2261 (1,0). \n        We shall also assume that \u03bc, \u03bb are constant,\n        and set a \u03c1 - 1. \n        Our system (<ref>) can thus be rewritten into the following linearised problem:\n        \n            _t a + \u00f7(u) = f     in  (0,\u221e) \u00d7^3, \n            _t u - \u03bc\u0394 u - (\u03bb + \u03bc) \u2207\u00f7(u) + P'(1)\u2207 a = g     in  (0,\u221e) \u00d7^3, \n            \n                (a,u)|_t=0 = (a_0,u_0)     in ^3,\n        \n        for some functions f,g.\n        We apply the orthogonal projections \ud835\udcab and \ud835\udcac onto the divergence and curl-free fields, respectively. Then, setting P'(1) and \u03bd\u03bb + 2\u03bc, we get the system\n        \n            _t a + \u00f7 (\ud835\udcac u) = f     in _> 0\u00d7^3, \n            _t  u - \u03bd\u0394 u + \u2207 a =  g     in _> 0\u00d7^3, \n            _t  u - \u03bc\u0394 u =  g     in _> 0\u00d7^3.\n        \n        \n        We set \n        \n            v  |D|^-1\u00f7 ( u),  where \n            |D|^s u  ^-1[ |\u03be|^s \u00fb],  s\u2208.\n        \n        We note that one can obtain v from u by a Fourier multiplier of homogeneous degree zero. Thus, bounding v is equivalent to bounding u (see <cit.>, Lemma 2.2).\n        \n        We note that we can set = \u03bd = 1, without loss of generality, since the following rescaling\n        \n        \n            a(t,x) = \u00e3/\u03bd t, \u221a()/\u03bd x ,    u(t,x) = \u221a() \u0169/\u03bd t , \u221a()/\u03bd x\n        \n        ensures that (\u00e3, \u1e7d) solves (<ref>) with = \u03bd = 1.\n        Thus we get that (a, v) solves the following system:\n        \n            _t a + |D| v = f     in _> 0\u00d7^3, \n            _t v - \u0394 v - |D| a = h  |D|^-1\u00f7 (g)     in _> 0\u00d7^3.\n        \n        \n        \n        In this paper, we shall focus on the homogeneous case, where f = h = 0.\n        \n        Before we give our main result, we introduce the concepts of Besov spaces, and high-frequency and low-frequency norms.\n        We denote by P(^3) the set of all polynomials over ^3.\n        \n        \n        We use the Littlewood-Paley decomposition of unity to define homogeneous Besov spaces.

We obtain the same decay rate as the previous proposition, and also prove that this decay rate is optimal in the L^\u221e-norm.\n        \n        Let s \u2208, p \u2208 [2,\u221e],q \u2208 [1,\u221e], and t > 1.\n        Then\n        \n            ^-1[ (t); (t) ]_\u1e02^s_p,q\u2264 \n                    C t^-3/2 (1-1/p) - 1/2 (1 - 2/p) ^-1[ _0; _0 ]^l_\u1e02^s_1,q\n                    +\n                    C e^-t^-1[ _0; _0 ]^h_\u1e02^s+3(1-1/p)_1,q.\n        \n        For the high-frequency norm, we also have for all t>0,\n        \n            ^-1[ (t); (t) ]^h_\u1e02^s_p,q\u2264 \n                    C e^-t^-1[ _0; _0 ]^h_\u1e02^s_p,q.\n        \n        Also, there exists initial data such that, for all sufficiently large t,\n        \n            ^-1[ (t); (t) ]_\u221e\u2265 C t^-2.\n        \n            The derivative loss in the high-frequency part of the L^1 \u2013 L^\u221e estimate (<ref>) is in fact caused by only one of the two eigenvalues (derived in Section 3) associated with the fundamental solution of our problem. \n            The other eigenvalue has strong enough smoothing properties that no additional derivatives are required when estimating its associated semigroup (see Proposition <ref>).\n            Note, however, that we can avoid the need for more regular initial data by using (<ref>) instead for the high-frequency part of solutions.\n        \n        \n        \n        We offer some commentary on the above decay rate for the low frequency part.\n        In Hoff-Zumbrun\u00a0<cit.>, it is demonstrated that the curl-free part of the solution to (<ref>) is approximated by a convolution of the Green's function for a parabolic system (whence we obtain the heat-like decay) and a function which decays like the fundamental solution of a wave equation (whence the additional decay).\n        To show that this decay rate is sharp in L^\u221e, we find that this wave-like part of the decay is slowest along |x| = t.\n        This is a natural result. \n        Indeed, looking at the homogeneous case f=h=0 for (<ref>), we may write\n        \n            ^2_t a - \u0394 a - |D|^3 v =0,\n                   ^2_t v - \u0394 v - _t \u0394 v =0.\n        \n        Note that the wave propagation speed above is 1.
