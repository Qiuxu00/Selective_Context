This foliation can be described dynamically as the strong unstable foliation for the geodesic flow on the invariant subvariety, and geometrically, it is induced by the canonical splitting of -valued cohomology into its real and imaginary parts. We define a natural volume form on the leaves of this foliation, and define horospherical measures as those measures whose conditional measures on leaves are given by the volume form. We show that the natural measures on invariant subvarieties, and in particular, the Masur-Veech measures on strata, are horospherical. We show that these measures are the unique horospherical measures giving zero mass to the set of surfaces with no  horizontal saddle connections, extending work of Lindenstrauss-Mirzakhani \nand Hamenst\u00e4dt \n\nfor principal strata. We describe all the leaf closures for the horospherical foliation.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\nIt is an interesting fact that geometric questions about rational polygonal billiards can be addressed by studying the dynamics on moduli spaces of translation surfaces. This is one of many reasons  to study the dynamics on moduli spaces of translation surfaces \u2014 see \n the surveys  <cit.> for other motivations and a survey of results. We remind the reader that this moduli space is partitioned into strata, which correspond to translation surfaces of a fixed topological type. The group G acts on each stratum.\n\nThe horocycle flow is given by \n\n    U {u_s  : s \u2208}\u2282 G,    where u_s\n     (  1     s \n      0     1 ).\n\nThe analogy between dynamics on strata and homogeneous dynamics has been fruitful. In the setting of homogeneous dynamics U-actions and G-actions were analyzed in work of Ratner which showed that orbit closures and ergodic invariant probability measures are surprisingly well-behaved. The dynamics of G-actions (and moreover the dynamics of its subgroup P of upper triangular matrices) on strata were analyzed in  two papers <cit.> where it was shown that orbit closures and ergodic invariant measures have nice  descriptions (see Section\u00a0<ref> for a precise statement). \n\n\nThe G-orbit closures\nare endowed with a wealth of geometrical structures, among which is the horospherical foliation which plays the role of the strong unstable manifold foliation for the one parameter diagonal subgroup which is called the geodesic flow (see <ref>). In <ref> we will define horospherical measures. Loosely speaking, the horospherical leaves are endowed with affine structures and the horospherical measures are those for which the conditional measures on theses leaves are translation invariant with respect to these affine structures.  \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Statement of results\n\nAll measures considered in this paper are Borel regular Radon measures on strata of translation surfaces. Any G-orbit closure ^(1)\u2282^(1) supports a unique ergodic G-invariant finite smooth measure; we will refer to this  measure as the special flat measure on ^(1). The following are the main results of this paper. \n\n\nThe special flat measure on any G-orbit closure is horospherical. \n\n\nWe will say that a measure \u03bc is saddle connection free if \u03bc-a.e. surface has no horizontal saddle connections.\n\n Up to scaling, the only saddle connection free horospherical measure on a G-orbit closure is the special flat measure. \n\n\nWe emphasize that horospherical measures are a a priori not assumed to be finite. It is thus a consequence of Theorem <ref> that horospherical measures are finite under the saddle connection free assumption; it seems likely, but we were not able to prove, that all horospherical ergodic measures are finite. Theorem <ref> was announced without proof in <cit.>.  The saddle connection free assumption cannot be removed; for example, the length measure on a periodic horocycle trajectory in a closed G-orbit. In <ref> we will give more interesting examples of invariant subvarieties and horospherical measures on them, which are not the special flat measure. We will also classify (see <ref>) all the horospherical measures on the simplest nontrivial invariant subvarieties, namely the eigenform loci in (1,1). \n\n\nIf a surface has a horizontal cylinder then so does any surface on its horospherical leaf. We will say that a leaf of the horospherical foliation is cylinder-free if all surfaces on the leaf have no horizontal cylinders. We say that a measure  \u03bc  on  is cylinder-free if \u03bc-a.e. surface has no horizontal cylinders. In <ref> we give examples of horospherical measures which are not special flat  and for which almost every point has a horizontal saddle connection. For these measures it is also the case that almost every point has a cylinder. \n\n\n\nIt seems likely that\nthis is always the case; or in other words, that in Theorem <ref> the condition `saddle connection free' can be\nweakened to `cylinder-free'. \nThe analogous assertion about orbit closures is true:\n\nAny cylinder-free leaf for the horospherical foliation is dense. \n\n\nThe proof of Theorem <ref> uses a statement of independent interest (Theorem <ref>), about extending horizontal saddle connections while staying inside  invariant suborbifolds. This result was explained to us by Paul Apisa and Alex Wright, and its proof is given in Appendix <ref>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geodesic flow is the restriction of the G-action to the subgroup\n\n    A {g_t : t \u2208}\u2282 G,    where  g_t  ( e^t     0 \n     0    \n          e^-t).\n\n\nFrom a dynamical perspective, the horospherical foliation is the strong unstable foliation for the geodesic flow. Our arguments yield a simpler proof of the following theorem.\n\n\nThe special flat measure is the unique A-invariant horospherical measure on any G-orbit closure. Any leaf for the weak-unstable foliation on any G-orbit closure is dense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Motivations, prior work, and some ideas from the proofs\n \n\nThe work of Eskin, Mirzakhani and Mohammadi gives a very detailed understanding of invariant measures and sets for the G-action and the P-action on strata of translation surfaces. A central remaining open problem is to understand horocycle invariant ergodic measures. \n\nAs we will see in <ref>, horospherical measures are horocycle-invariant; thus understanding horospherical measures can be seen as a contribution to the problem of understanding  general horocycle-invariant measures.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA previous measure rigidity result for horospherical measures was obtained in 2008, independently by Lindenstrauss and Mirzakhani <cit.> and by Hamenst\u00e4dt <cit.>. They were interested in understanding mapping class group invariant measures on the space of measured laminations. By a `duality principle' (see <cit.>) this question is very closely related to the problem of  classifying horospherical measures on the principal stratum. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur  argument for Theorem <ref> follows <cit.>, which in turn is inspired by ideas of Dani <cit.> and Margulis <cit.> The main ingredients are the mixing of the A-action, the use of dynamical boxes and how they transform under the A-action,  and nondivergence results for the U-action (which in the present context were obtained in <cit.>). After the requisite preparations, this argument is given in <ref>. In order to carry out the details of this argument one needs to give a precise description of horospherical measures and the special flat measures, and their decomposition into conditional measures in flow boxes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Paul Apisa and Alex Wright for providing the proof\nof Theorem <ref>.

There are many approaches to these definitions. In our\napproach, the linear orbifold structure (or affine orbifold structure) given by period coordinates will be important and we will stress this point of view in what follows. A suitable reference for the theory utilizing this point of view is  <cit.>, and unless stated otherwise, our notation, terminology and assumptions are as in <cit.>. \nSee also \n<cit.>.\nSee <cit.> for a general discussion of affine manifolds.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Strata and period coordinates\n\n\nLet S be a connected, compact orientable surface of genus g, \u03a3 = {\u03be_1, \u2026, \u03be_k }\u2282 S a finite set, a_1, \u2026, a_k non-negative integers with \u2211 a_i = 2g-2, and = (a_1, \u2026, a_k) the corresponding stratum of translation surfaces. We let _m=_m(a_1, \u2026, a_k) denote the stratum of marked translation surfaces and \u03c0 : _m\u2192 the forgetful mapping. It will be useful to assume that singular points are labeled, or equivalently, = _m / (S, \u03a3), where (S, \u03a3) is the group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of S fixing \u03a3, up to an isotopy fixing \u03a3. \n\nWe will typically denote elements of  by the letter q when we want to consider them as points of , and by the letter M or M_q when we want to consider their underlying topological or geometrical properties as spaces in their own right. To make this distinction clear we will write M_q for the underlying surface associated with a point q \u2208. Points in _m will be typically denoted by boldface letters such as  . \n\nWe recall the definition of the map : _m\u2192 H^1(S, \u03a3; ^2). \nFor an oriented path \u03b3 in M_q which is either closed or has endpoints at singularities, let (M_q, \u03b3) ( \u222b_\u03b3 dx_q, \u222b_\u03b3 dy_q ), where dx_q and dy_q are the 1-forms on M_q inherited from the the forms dx and dy on the plane. \nGiven \u2208_m represented by f: S \u2192 M_q, where M_q is a translation surface, we define ()  f^*((M_q, \u00b7)). The map  is also known in the literature as the period map. There is an open cover {\ud835\udcb0_\u03c4} of _m, indexed by triangulations \u03c4 of S with triangles whose vertices are in \u03a3, such that the restricted maps\n\n    \u03c6_\u03c4|_\ud835\udcb0_\u03c4,   \u03c6_\u03c4: \ud835\udcb0_\u03c4\u2192 H^1(S, \u03a3; ^2)\n \nare homeomorphisms onto their image. The charts \u03c6_\u03c4 give an atlas with affine overlap maps and endow \u210b_m with a structure of affine manifold. This atlas of charts {(\ud835\udcb0_\u03c4, \u03c6_\u03c4)} is known as the period coordinate atlas.  \n\nThe (S,\u03a3)-action on _m is properly discontinuous and affine, and hence  inherits the structure of affine orbifold, and the map \u03c0: _m\u2192 is an orbifold covering map. We can associate to any affine manifold a holonomy cover and a developing map. In this case  is the holonomy cover and  is the developing map of  (see <cit.>).\n\nThe group  acts on translation surfaces in   and _m by modifying planar charts. It acts on H^1(S, \u03a3; ^2) via its action on the coefficients ^2.  The -action commutes with the (S, \u03a3)-action, and thus the map \u03c0 is -equivariant for these actions. The -action on _m is free, since (g) \u2260() for any nontrivial g \u2208. \n\nWe have a coordinate splitting of ^2 and we write ^2 = _x\u2295_y to distinguish the two summands in this splitting. There is a corresponding splitting of cohomology\n\n    H^1(S, \u03a3; ^2) = H^1(S, \u03a3; _x)  \u2295\n      H^1(S, \u03a3; _y).\n\nWe refer to the summands in this splitting as the horizontal space and vertical space respectively.\n\n It can also be useful to identify the coefficients with  and consider H^1(S, \u03a3; ). This is the most natural choice when we are considering Abelian differentials.\nAn -structure on a complex vector space V is given by a choice of a real subspace W\u2282 V so that V=W\u2295\ud835\udc22W. \nIf V is equipped with an -structure we say that a complex subspace V'\u2282 V is defined over  if V'=W'\u2295\ud835\udc22W' for some real subspace W'\u2282 W.\nWe give H^1(S, \u03a3; ) the -structure corresponding to the real subspace H^1(S, \u03a3; )=H^1(S, \u03a3; _x)\u2282 H^1(S, \u03a3; ). In this language \ud835\udc22H^1(S, \u03a3; )=H^1(S, \u03a3; _y).\n\nIf V has an -structure then an -basis for V is a basis for V as a complex vector space consisting of elements of W.\nWe say that a linear equation on V has real coefficients if it is represented by a matrix with real entries when expressed with respect to an -basis.\n\n\nLet V\u2282 H^1(S, \u03a3; ) be a complex vector space.  \nThe following are equivalent:\n\n    \n  * \n    V is invariant under the action of .\n    \n  * \n    V\u2282 H^1(S, \u03a3; ) is defined over .\n    \n  * \n    V is the set of zeros of a collection of linear equations with real coefficients.\n\n\n \nThe universal coefficients theorem identifies H^1(S, \u03a3; ^2 ) with \n\n    (H_1(S,\u03a3;),^2 ).\n \nWith respect to this identification  acts on the left by post-composition.\n\n\nLet \n\n    a[  0 -1;  1  0 ],    b [ 1 0; 0 0 ],     and  c  aba^-1 = \n    [ 0 0; 0 1 ].\n\n\nNote that multiplication by a corresponds to multiplication by \ud835\udc22, and multiplication by b and c correspond respectively to projections onto \nthe two summands in (<ref>). \n\n\n\n\n\nWe first prove the implication (<ref>)  (<ref>).  If V is a complex vector space then it is invariant under a, b and c.  Since a,b,c generate the ring of 2 \u00d7 2 real matrices, V is -invariant. \n\nIt is clear that (<ref>) implies (<ref>), and we now prove that (<ref>) implies (<ref>). \n If h:H_1(S,\u03a3;)\u2192^2 is an element of (H_1(S,\u03a3;),^2) and L\u2208, then h maps to L\u2218 h. In particular h and h' differ by an element of  exactly when they have the same kernel. Thus if V is  invariant it corresponds to a subspace K\u2282 H_1(S,\u03a3;)\u2192^2. If k_j is a basis for K then V is determined by the equations v\u00b7 k_j=0 where the dot represents the Kronecker pairing. These equations have real coefficients.\n\n\nWe have a restriction map : H^1(S, \u03a3; ^2) \u2192 H^1(S; ^2) (given by restricting a cochain to closed paths). Since  is topologically defined, its kernel ( ) is (S, \u03a3)-invariant. \nMoreover our convention that singular points are marked implies that the (S, \u03a3)-action on ( ) is trivial.\n\nDefine\n\n    Z =  (  )\u2229 H^1(S, \u03a3; _x).\n\nSince monodromy acts trivially on Z, for any v \u2208 Z the constant vector field on H^1(S, \u03a3; ^2) in direction v pulls back to a well-defined vector field on _m on  via the local diffeomorphism dev. Integrating this vector field gives a locally defined real REL flow (corresponding to v) (t, q) \u21a6_tv(q). For every q \u2208 a trajectory is defined for t \u2208 I_q, where the domain of definition I_q  = I_q(v) is an open interval of  which contains 0. This interval is all of  if the underlying surface M_q has no horizontal saddle connections. If q \u2208,   s \u2208 and t \u2208 I_q then t \u2208  I_u_sq, and _tv(u_sq) = u_s _tv(q). The set\n\n    Z^(q){v \u2208 Z: _v(q)  is defined} = {v \u2208 Z: 1 \u2208 I_q(v)},\n\nas well as the sets I_q(v), are explicitly described in <cit.>. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Invariant subvarieties\n\n\nIn this subsection, we introduce our notion of invariant subvarieties and irreducible invariant subvarieties. It will be shown in <cit.>, using the work of Eskin-Mirzakhani <cit.> and Eskin-Mirzakhani-Mohammadi <cit.>, that an irreducible invariant subvariety is exactly a -orbit closure while an invariant subvariety is a finite union of such -orbit closures. \n\n\n A d-dimensional linear manifold is a submanifold L of  which is a connected component of ^-1(V) where V is a d-dimensional complex subspace of H^1(S,\u03a3;^2) defined over .\n\n\n\n Since the developing map is equivariant and (S,\u03a3) acts linearly on the space H^1(S,\u03a3;^2 ), it follows that (S,\u03a3) takes a d-dimensional linear manifold to a d-dimensional linear manifold.\nIf L is a linear manifold corresponding to V_L \u2282 H^1(S,\u03a3;^2 ), we denote by \u0393_L be the subgroup of (S,\u03a3) that preserves L. Since the developing map  is (S,\u03a3)-equivariant, we get an induced action of \u0393_L on V_L. We say that L is an equilinear manifold if furthermore we have (\u03b3|_V_L)= \u00b1 1 for every \u03b3\u2208\u0393_L.  \n\n\nA d-dimensional invariant subvariety is a subset  \u2282 such that \u03c0^-1() is a locally finite union of d-dimensional equilinear manifolds.\n\n\nWe will write d =  (); in some texts this is referred to as the complex dimension of .\nThe term \u201cinvariant\" in the definition  of invariant subvariety is justified by the following: \n\n\nAn invariant subvariety is  closed and -invariant.\n\n\n\nSince V is a closed subset of H^1(S,\u03a3;^2) it follows that  ^-1(V) is a closed subset of . It follows that a linear manifold is a closed subset of .\nThe set \u03c0^-1() is closed because it is a locally finite union of closed sets, and this implies that  is closed.\n\nSince \u03c0 is -equivariant, it is enough to prove that \u03c0^-1() is -invariant. Let L be a linear submanifold contained in \u03c0^-1() which maps to V_L under . By definition, V_L is defined over  and by Lemma <ref> it is invariant under the action of  on H^1(S,\u03a3;^2 ). Since  is -equivariant the action of  on  preserves ^-1(V_L). Since  is connected, the action of  on  preserves L. Since \u03c0^-1() is a union of linear sub-manifolds it follows that it is invariant under .  \n\n\n\n\n    A d-dimensional invariant subvariety is said to be irreducible if it cannot be written as a union of two proper distinct d-dimensional invariant subvarieties. \n\n\n\n\nWe have the following equivalent characterization:\n\n\n    Let  be a d-dimensional invariant subvariety. Then  is irreducible if and only if for any d-dimensional equilinear manifold L \u2282\u03c0^-1(), we have \n     \n    \u22c3_\u03b3\u2208(S,\u03a3) L \u00b7\u03b3 = \u03c0^-1().\n\n\n\nFor the proof of Proposition <ref> we will need the following: \n     If L and L' are distinct d-dimensional linear submanifolds, then  \u03c0(L)\u2229\u03c0(L') is a meager subset of \u03c0(L) and of \u03c0(L').\n \n \n We first show that \u03c0^-1(\u03c0(L)\u2229\u03c0(L') ) is a countable union of sets of dimension less than d. We have:\n \n    \u03c0^-1(\u03c0(L))=\u22c3_\u03b3\u2208(S,\u03a3) L\u00b7\u03b3  and  \u03c0^-1(\u03c0(L'))=\u22c3_\u03b3\u2208(S,\u03a3) L'\u00b7\u03b3.\n\n\nNow consider an intersection  (L\u00b7\u03b3) \u2229 (L'\u00b7\u03b3'). We have (L\u00b7\u03b3)\u2282 V and (L'\u00b7\u03b3)\u2282 V' for d-dimensional linear subspaces of H^1(S,\u03a3;^2). \n If V=V' then L\u00b7\u03b3 and L'\u00b7\u03b3' are topological components of ^-1(V) so they are either disjoint or equal. If L\u00b7\u03b3=L'\u00b7\u03b3' then L=L'\u00b7\u03b3'\u03b3^-1 so \n \u03c0^-1(\u03c0(L))=\u03c0^-1(\u03c0(L')) and \u03c0(L)=\u03c0(L') contrary to assumption.\n \n If V V' then (L\u00b7\u03b3) \u2229 (L'\u00b7\u03b3')\u2282^-1(V\u2229 V'). This is a complex subspace of positive codimension so its inverse image is a nowhere dense subset of the d-dimensional manifolds L\u00b7\u03b3 and L'\u00b7\u03b3'. \n Thus \u03c0^-1(\u03c0(L)\u2229\u03c0(L')) is a meager subset of \u03c0^-1(\u03c0(L)) and \u03c0^-1(\u03c0(L')). Since \u03c0 is open and the intersections (L \u00b7\u03b3) \u2229 (L' \u00b7\u03b3') are closed, the projection \u03c0(L)\u2229\u03c0(L') is a meager subset of \u03c0(L) and \u03c0(L').\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay that  is irreducible and let L be a d-dimensional equilinear manifold in \u03c0^-1(). If (<ref>) is false, we can write \u03c0^-1() as a countable union of orbits of distinct linear submanifolds L_1,L_2,\u2026, as \n\n    \u03c0^-1()= \u22c3_\u2113\u22c3_\u03b3\u2208(S,\u03a3) L_\u2113\u00b7\u03b3,\n\nwhere L=L_1 and the list {L_i} contains more than one element. We have \n \n    = \u22c3_\u2113\u03c0( L_\u2113).\n\n We define\n \n    A \u03c0(L_1)  and  B \u22c3_1<\u2113\u03c0(L_\u2113).\n\nSince  is irreducible, and since we have assumed that  (<ref>) fails, we have =B. This implies A\u2282 B, and hence  \u03c0(L_1)=\u22c3_\u2113\u03c0(L_1)\u2229\u03c0(L_\u2113).\n According to Lemma\u00a0<ref> \u03c0(L_1)\u2229\u03c0(L_\u2113) is a meager subset of \u03c0(L_1) so our decomposition of \u03c0(L_1) expresses \u03c0(L_1) as a meager set and violates the Baire category theorem. We conclude that =A which is what we wanted to show.\n\n Now assume that for any d-dimensional equilinear manifold L \u2282\u03c0^-1() we have (<ref>). Suppose we have a decomposition =A\u222a B where\n\n    A= \u22c3_j\u03c0(L_j)  and  B=\u22c3_k\u03c0(L'_k),\n\n  where both collections {L_i},  {L'_k} are (S, \u03a3)-invariant and comprised of d-dimensional equilinear manifolds. By (<ref>), \u03c0^-1(A) and \u03c0^-1(B) are either empty or equal to \u03c0^-1(). Thus A and B are not proper subsets of . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt follows from Proposition <ref> that if  is a d-dimensional irreducible invariant subvariety and L is a d-dimensional equilinear manifold contained in \u03c0^-1(), then \u03c0(L)=. This motivates the following definition that will be used throughout the text \n\n\n    Let  be a d-dimensional irreducible invariant subvariety. A lift of  is a d-dimensional equilinear manifold L \u2282\u03c0^-1(). \n\n\n\n\nThe following result \nestablishes the link between -orbit closures and invariant subvarieties. In the forthcoming \n<cit.>, it will be deduced from the results of <cit.>.  \n\n\nIrreducible invariant subvarieties and -orbit closures coincide. Furthermore, any invariant subvariety is a finite union of irreducible invariant subvarieties. \n\n\n\n\n\nStanding assumption: all the invariant subvarieties we will consider from now on will be assumed to be irreducible. \n\n\n\n\nLet  be a d-dimensional invariant subvariety. We conclude this section by constructing a Radon measure supported on  which will be uniquely defined up to a multiplicative constant. This will require some standard constructions which are summarized in Appendix <ref> for lack of a suitable reference. Let L be a lift of , let V_L = (L) and let \u0393_L be the stabilizer in (S,\u03a3) of L. Let \u03b1 be a volume form on L that is obtained as the pullback by  of an element of the top degree exterior power of V_L. The group  acts smoothly on . Denoting by g^\u2217 the pull-back operator on differential forms corresponding to the action of g \u2208 on , we have \n\n    \u2200 g \u2208,   g^\u2217\u03b1 = (det g)^d \u03b1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe volume form \u03b1 defines a measure on L that we denote by \u03bc_L. Since L is an equilinear manifold, the measure \u03bc_L is \u0393_L-invariant. Furthermore, since (S,\u03a3) acts transitively on the set of irreducible components, it can be arranged that for any \u03b3\u2208(S,\u03a3), \u03b3_\u2217 m_L = m_L \u00b7\u03b3. This means that the sum\n\n    \u03bc\u0303_ = \u2211_L \u2282\u03c0^-1()\u03bc_L,\n \nwhere the sum ranges over the lifts of ,\nis a (S,\u03a3)-invariant measure on .\nThe measure \u03bc\u0303_ is a Radon measure, which follows from the fact that the collection of irreducible components is locally finite. Using Proposition <ref>, there is a unique Radon measure \u03bc_ on  such that for any f \u2208 C_c(), we have\n\n    \u222b_ f  d\u03bc\u0303_ = \u222b_( \u222b_ f  d\u03b8_q )  d\u03bc_(q),\n\nwhere \n\n    \u03b8_q \u2211_\u2208\u03c0^-1( q) N() \u00b7\u03b4_,   N()   |{\u03b3\u2208(S, \u03a3) :  = \u00b7\u03b3}|\n\n(as in (<ref>)). \nThe measure \u03bc_ is supported on . It follows from Lemma\u00a0<ref> that it is -invariant. We call it the linear measure on . Notice that this is a slight abuse of language as \u03bc_ is only determined up to a multiplicative constant. \n  \n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Area one locus, cone construction, and special linear measures\n Let \u2208_m, let q =\u03c0(), and let M= M_q be the  underlying translation surface. The area of M can be expressed using period coordinates as follows.\nWe define a Hermitian form on H^1(S, \u03a3 ; ) by \n\n    ( \u03b1, \u03b2 ) = 1/2 \ud835\udc22\u222b_S\u03b1\u2227\u03b2\u0305.\n\n(See <cit.> for a topological interpretation of (<ref>).) The area of M is then given by ((), ()). This is thus a quadratic formula in period coordinates. \n\nFor the purposes of this paper we will use a related real valued bracket \u27e8\u03b1, \u03b2\u27e9 involving the pairing of horizontal and vertical classes. Say that on a marked surface M_q we have a 1-form \u03b1 corresponding to an element of H^1(S, \u03a3; _x) (a horizontal form) and a 1-form \u03b2 corresponding to an element of H^1(S, \u03a3; _y) (a vertical form). Then \n\n    \u27e8\u03b1, \u03b2\u27e9 =  \u222b_S\u03b1\u2227\u03b2\n\nand this gives\n\n    (M_q)=\u27e8 dx_q, dy_q \u27e9 =  \u222b_S dx_q \u2227 dy_q .\n\n\nWe denote the subset of surfaces in  and  of area one by ^(1) and ^(1). More generally, when  is an invariant subvariety and L is a lift of , we also denote by ^(1) and L^(1) their intersection with the area-one locus. The latter are G-invariant and invariant under real REL flows (where defined). \n\nWe recall that there is a rescaling action of _+^\u2217 on  that corresponds to the action of the subgroup of  of scalar matrices with positive coefficients. We consider the cone measure m_ on ^(1) defined for any Borel subset A \u2282^(1) by \n\n    (A) \u03bc_(cone(A)),   where cone(A) {t\u00b7 a : t \u2208 (0,1],  a \u2208 A}.\n\nWhen  is the whole stratum , the measure m_ is called the Masur-Veech measure. More generally, we shall call the measure  the special flat measure on . If L is a lift of , we can perform the same cone construction with the measure \u03bc_L and we denote by m_L the corresponding measure. \nLet m\u0303_\nbe the pre-image of m_ under \u03c0, that is the unique measure \non  such that \nfor any f \u2208 C_c(),\n\n    \u222b_\u03c0^-1() f  dm\u0303_ = \u222b_(\u222b_X\u0303 f  d\u03b8_q )  dm_(q)\n\n    (see \nDefinition <ref>). It is easily verified that \n\n    m\u0303_ = \u2211_L \u2282\u03c0^-1() m_L.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The sup-norm Finsler metric\n \nWe now recall the sup-norm  Finsler metric on .  This structure was studied by Avila, Gou\u00ebzel and Yoccoz, for proofs and more details see <cit.> and <cit.>. Let \u00b7 denote the Euclidean norm on ^2. For a translation surface q, denote by \u039b_q the collection of saddle connections on M_q and let \u2113_q(\u03c3)= _q(\u03c3) be the length of \u03c3\u2208\u039b_q. For \u03b2\u2208 H^1(M_q,\u03a3_q; ^2) we set \n\n    \u03b2_q sup_\u03c3\u2208\u039b_q\u03b2(\u03c3)/\u2113_q(\u03c3).\n\n\n\nWe now define a Finsler metric for . Let f: S \u2192 M_q be a marking map representing a marked surface \u2208. Using period coordinates we can  identify the tangent space to  at  with H^1(S,\u03a3;^2).  \nThen \n\n    \u03b2_sup_\u03c4\u2208\u039b_\u03b2(f(\u03c4))/\u2113_q(f(\u03c4))\n\nis a norm on H^1(S, \u03a3 ; ^2). It satisfies the equivariance property \n\n    \u2200 h \u2208(S,\u03a3),   \u03b2_ = h^*\u03b2_ . h,\n\nwhere . h is represented by the marking map f \u2218 h. \nThe map \n\n    T(_m) \u2192,        (,\u03b2) \u21a6\u03b2_\n\nis continuous.  \nThe Finsler metric  defines a distance function[In order to avoid confusion we use `distance function' to refer to what is often called a metric.] on  which we call the sup-norm distance and define as follows:\n\n    dist(_0, _1) inf_\u03b3\u222b_0^1 \u03b3'(\u03c4)_\u03b3(\u03c4) d\u03c4,\n\nwhere \u03b3 ranges over smooth paths \u03b3:[0,1] \u2192 with \u03b3(0)=_0 and \u03b3(1) = _1.  The topology induced by the sup norm distance on   is the one  induced by period coordinates, and the resulting metric space  is proper and complete. We can use the distance function on  to define a distance function on  by\n\n    dist(q_0, q_1) = inf{dist(_0, _1): _i \u2208\u03c0^-1(q_i),  i=0,1}.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 HOROSPHERICAL MEASURES\n\n\nLet  be an invariant subvariety of dimension n. The goal of this section is to define the horospherical foliation on  and the related horospherical measures, which are our object of study in this paper. These objects will be defined via their counterparts for the irreducible components of \u03c0^-1(). \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Boxes\n We now define a notion of boxes. They will be used throughout the text and will play two roles: boxes give local coordinates on invariant subvarieties (more precisely, on the irreducible components of their pre-image by \u03c0) that are convenient for the study of horospherical measures; additionally, they will be used in a mixing argument in the proof of Theorem <ref>.\n\nFrom now on, we identify H^1(S,\u03a3,) with H^1(S,\u03a3,^2) as in <ref>.  Let V \u2282 H^1(S,\u03a3,) be a complex linear subspace defined over . We have \n\n    V = V_x\u2295 V_y,\n\nwhere\n\n    V_x V \u2229 H^1(S, \u03a3; _x)    and  V_y V \u2229 H^1(S, \u03a3; _y)\n\nare identified by the isomorphism V_x\u220b v \u21a6\ud835\udc22 v \u2208 V_y. We define\n\n    V^(1){(x,y) \u2208 V: x \u2208 V_x,   y \u2208 V_y,  \u27e8 x, y \u27e9 =1 },\n\nand denote by\n\n    \u03c0_ : V \u2192 V_,      \u03c0_: V \u2192 V_\n\nthe projections corresponding to the direct sum\ndecomposition (<ref>), and by \u03c0'_ the\nprojection from \u03c0_^-1 (V_{0}) to the\nprojective space \ud835\udc0f(V_). Finally let\n\n    \u03a8:V^(1)\u2192\ud835\udc0f(V_)\u00d7 V_,     \u03a8(q)  =\n      (\u03c0'_(q),\u03c0_(q)).\n\n \n  The map \u03a8 is a local diffeomorphism.\n\n\n\n\nSay that (x_0, y_0) \u2208 V^(1) is mapped by \u03a8 to (x\u0305_0,y_0) in \ud835\udc0f(V_)\u00d7 V_. We will construct a local inverse. Since \u27e8 x_0,y_0\u27e9=1 we can find neighborhoods U_ of x_0 in V_ and  U_ of y_0 in V_ so that \u27e8 x,y\u27e9>0 for x\u2208 U_ and y\u2208 U_. We define maps\n\n    \u03c8\u0303:U_\u00d7 U_\u2192 V^(1),    \u03c8\u0303(x,y)=(x/\u27e8 x,y\u27e9,y )\n\nand\n\n    \u03c8:U'_\u00d7 U_\u2192 V^(1),    \u03c8([x],y) \u03c8\u0303(x,y),     where  U'_\u03c0'_(U_).\n\nThe map \u03c8\u0303 is smooth and descends in a well-defined way to define \u03c8. We see that \u03a8\u2218\u03c8 is the identity map, i.e., \u03c8 is a local inverse of \u03a8. \n\n\n[Boxes]\nLet L be a lift of  and let V = (L). A box in L is a relatively compact subset \u2282 L^(1) together with a diffeomorphism \u03c6 : \u2192 such that, in the notations above,\n\n  \n  * U'_ and U_ are open sets in V_ and \ud835\udc0f(V_) respectively.\n  \n  * \u03a8\u2218\u2218\u03c6 = Id.\n\nFor y  \u2208 U_, the plaque of y in  is the set _y \u03c6(U'_\u00d7{y}). \n\n\nThe composition in the second item in Definition <ref> makes sense since (L^(1)) \u2282 V^(1), in light of \n(<ref>).\nIt should be understood as a choice of a suitable parameterization for boxes. Note that the data \u03c6, are implicit in the notion of a box, but in order to avoid excessive notation we simply write .\n\nMore generally, a box in \u03c0^-1() is a box in one of the irreducible components of \u03c0^-1(). Such a box  will be called regular if for any \u03b3\u2208(S,\u03a3) either \u00b7\u03b3\u2229 = \u2205 or \u03b3\u2208\u0393, where \u0393 is the stabilizer in (S,\u03a3) of  (i.e. the set of \u03b3\u2208(S,\u03a3) such that \u00b7\u03b3 =). When  is regular, the map \u03c0 induces a homeomorphism / \u0393\u2192\u03c0(). In particular the image of a regular box by \u03c0 is an open subset of . Since (S,\u03a3) acts diagonally on \ud835\udc0f(H^1(S,\u03a3,_)) \u00d7 H^1(S,\u03a3,_), the set of boxes is preserved by the action of (S,\u03a3). Furthermore, a finite intersection of boxes is a box. Thus, by Lemma <ref>, for every \u2208\u03c0^-1(), there is a regular box in \u03c0^-1() containing . \n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an asymmetry in the definition of a box; we could equally well define a box using V_ and \ud835\udc0f(V_), but we will make no use of that kind of box.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Definition of the horospherical foliation\n\nRecall that a smooth map of manifolds is a submersion if its\nderivative is of full rank at every point. The implicit function\ntheorem implies that the connected components of the fibers of a\nsubmersion are the leaves of a foliation. \n\n \nLet L be a lift of  and let V be the linear space on which L is modeled. The foliations on L^(1) induced by the submersions\n\n    \u03c0'_\u2218 : L^(1)\u2192\ud835\udc0f(V_)   and  \u03c0_\u2218 : L^(1)\u2192 V_,\n\nare called the weak stable and strong unstable foliations. They are denoted respectively by ^s and  ^uu. The leaves of \u2208 L^(1) are denoted by ^s() and  ^uu(). \n\n\nIt follows from Lemma <ref> that these foliations are well-defined, and the leaves of these foliations are everywhere transverse. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere was an idea to discuss this in the language of \n  orbifold foliations and (G,X)-structures. \n  I guess Peter's contribution in this direction is in the file `(G, X) structures on \n  orbifolds'... but I didn't understand whether Peter wanted us to use \n  that, and if so, how... I used the stuff in 2.3 to remove the \n  need to work with orbifolds. Note that the boxes are only boxes in the \n  nonsingular part of  and similarly for the foliation. Please check \n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that  for \u2208_m, the local group \u0393_\n  for the orbifold structure on  is the subgroup of (S,\n  \u03a3) fixing . We will say that a foliation on\n  _m induces an orbifold foliation on  if\n  the monodromy action permutes the leaves,  and each local group  \u0393_ preserves the \n  tangent space to the leaf of ; the leaves of an orbifold\n  foliation are thus orbifolds on their own right. \n\n\n\n \nThe action of (S, \u03a3) permutes the leaves of ^uu. For any leaf F, the restriction |_F is a local homeomorphism to an affine subspace of V and with respect to this affine structure, the subgroup \u0393_L {\u03b3\u2208(S, \u03a3) : L \u00b7\u03b3 = L} acts on the leaves of W_L^uu by affine maps. \n\n\n\nThe monodromy preserves the product splitting V=V_\u2295 V_ and acts linearly on each factor. Thus the monodromy acts projectively on \ud835\udc0f(V_). Since  is monodromy equivariant, the leaves of the foliations ^s, ^uu are permuted by the action of (S, \u03a3). \n\nFor the second assertion, it is clear from the definitions that  maps the leaf F to a set of the form { (x,y_0) \u2208 V : x \u2208 V_ and \u27e8 x, y_0 \u27e9 =1} for some fixed y_0 \u2208 V_y, and by Lemma <ref>, the map |_F is a local diffeomorphism. The last assertion follows from the (S, \u03a3)-equivariance of  and the fact that (S, \u03a3) preserves the bracket \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9. \n\n\n\n\nLemma <ref> equips the leaves of the foliation W^uu with an affine manifold structure. This structure need  not be geodesically complete. Using real Rel deformations, one easily constructs affine geodesics in a leaf ^uu() which contain a surface with a horizontal saddle connection whose length  goes to zero as one moves along the leaf. There are additional sources of non-completeness involving surfaces whose horizontal foliation is minimal but not uniquely ergodic, see <cit.>. Furthermore, using <cit.>, one can show that each leaf ^uu() is mapped by the developing map homeomorphically to an explicitly described convex domain in H^1(S, \u03a3; _), defined by finitely many linear inequalities. \n\n\n\n\nIt follows from Lemma <ref> that the partition of L^(1) given by the leaves ^uu induces a partition of ^(1). We denote it by W^uu and if q \u2208, we denote by W^uu(q) the element of the partition  that contains q. We emphasize that W^uu does not depend on the choice of a particular irreducible component used to define it. This is a consequence of the fact that (S,\u03a3) acts on H^1(S,\u03a3,) by real endomorphisms and thus preserves the splitting into real and imaginary parts of cohomology classes.  \n\n\n    A horosphere is an element of the partition of W^uu. \n\n\n\nOccasionally, we may call the partition W^uu the horospherical foliation of . Even if this will play no role in the rest of the paper, we justify this choice of terminology for the sake of completeness: the invariant subvariety  can be seen to have the structure of a properly immersed manifold , i.e., is the image of a manifold  under a proper orbifold immersion f : \u2192 and there is a foliation on  whose leaves are sent to horospheres by f. We can choose  to be the quotient of L by a finite-index torsion-free normal subgroup \u0393_0 of (S, \u03a3) and f : L / \u0393_0 \u2192,  \u0393_0 \u21a6\u03c0(). By Lemma <ref>, the horospherical foliation on L descends to a foliation on the manifold L /\u0393_0. The leaves of this foliation are indeed mapped to horospheres and f is an orbifold immersion. The fact that it is proper follows from the fact that the collection of irreducible components of \u03c0^-1() is locally finite.\n\n\n\nReversing the roles of \u03c0_ and \u03c0_, and defining \u03c0'_ in an analogous fashion, we also define the strong stable and unstable foliations ^ss and ^u as those induced by the submersion \u03c0_\u2218,  \u03c0'_\u2218 respectively. Lemma <ref> holds for these foliations as well, with obvious modifications. Summarizing: for every \u2208 L we have\n\n    ^ss() \u2282^s(),    ^uu() \u2282^u(),\n\nthe leaves ^ss() and ^uu() have a natural affine structure and, for n =  (), we have \n\n    ^ss() = ^uu() = n-1,      ^s() = ^u(q) = n.\n\n\nAs we saw in <ref>, the sup-norm Finsler metric induces a distance function on _m as a path metric. We will induce distance functions on leaves of the stable and strong stable foliations using the same approach. For _0, _1 \u2208_m belonging to the same stable (respectively, strong stable) leaf, we  define dist^(s)(_0, _1) (respectively, dist^(ss)(_0, _1)) by (<ref>), but making the additional requirement that the entire path \u03b3 is contained in the stable (respectively strong stable) leaf of the _i. \n\nWe similarly define dist^(s)(q_0, q_1) and dist^(ss)(q_0, q_1) for q_0, q_1 \u2208 belonging to the same stable (respectively, strong stable) leaf. We will call the distance functions dist^(s),  dist^(ss) the stable (resp. strong stable) sup-norm distance function. \n\nThese distance functions have the following properties:\n\n\nLet L a lift of  and let _0, _1 \u2208 L.\n  \n\n    \n  *  If _0, _1 are in the same stable (resp., strong stable leaf) leaf then dist(_0, _1) \u2264dist^(s) (_0, _1) (resp., dist(_0, _1) \u2264dist^(ss) (_0, _1)).\n    \n  *  If _0, _1 are in the same strong stable leaf then for all t \u2265 0, \n    \n    \n    dist^(ss) (g_t _0, g_t _1) \u2264dist^(ss) (_0, _1).\n\n\n    And the same holds for the strong unstable leaf. \n    \n    \n  *  If _1 = g_t _0 for some t \u2208 then dist^(s)(_0, _1) \u2264 |t|.\n    \n  * Statements (<ref>), (<ref>) and (<ref>) also hold in , for q_0, q_1 in place of _0, _1. \n \n   \n\n\nAssertion (<ref>) is obvious from definitions, and assertions (<ref>) and (<ref>) are proved in <cit.> (where what we call the strong stable foliation is referred to as the stable foliation). The assertions for  follows from the corresponding ones for _m. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost everywhere, the horospheres W^uu(q), W^ss(q) are actually the unstable and stable manifolds of the geodesic flow. That is, for any q, and almost every (with respect to the measure class induced by the affine structure on leaves) q_1 \u2208 W^uu(q),   q_2 \u2208 W^ss(q), we have \n\n    dist (g_t q, g_t q_1) t \u2192 -\u221e\u27f6 0   and  dist (g_t q, g_t q_2) t \u2192\u221e\u27f6 0.\n\nThis is proved in <cit.> (see also <cit.>) for = ^(1). The same result for general invariant subvarieties can be proved by adapting the  arguments  used in <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Definition of horospherical measures\n\n\nLet L be a lift of  and let V \u2282 H^1(S,\u03a3,) be the subspace on which L is modeled. We write V = V_\u2295 V_ as in (<ref>). Let \u03b7_ and \u03b7_ be the translation invariant volume forms on V_ and V_ determined by a choice of an element of the top degree wedge power of V_\u2245 V_. Define\n\n    \u03b1_ (\u03c0_\u2218)^*(\u03b7_),       \u03b1_ (\u03c0_\u2218)^*(\u03b7_).\n\n\n\nWe recall that the measure \u03bc_L on L was defined in Section <ref> as the integral of a volume form \u03b1. From now on, this form will be chosen so that \u03b1 = \u03b1_\u2227\u03b1_y. We define the Euler vector field E on  such that for any \u2208,\n\n    E(q)= E_x() \u2202/\u2202 t|_t=0[ e^t   0;   0 e^t ]\u00b7.\n\n\nThis vector field can be thought of as the tangent vector to the rescaling action, which justifies our choice of terminology. Notice furthermore that the image of E by  is the usual Euler vector field e(v) = v on H^1(S,\u03a3;). This is due to the fact that  is -equivariant. Since L is a linear manifold, the vector field E is tangent to it.  We use this to define the form\n\n    \u03b9_E \u03b1_,\n\ni.e., the contraction of \u03b1_ by the Euler field E. The restriction of  to the leaves of ^uu induces a volume form. We denote by \u03bd_\u03b2_ the induced measures. \nWe emphasize that this defines a system of measures, one on each leaf W^uu_L(),  so one should write \u03bd_,^L instead of \u03bd_\u03b2_; we omit this in our notation. We say that a measure m on L is horospherical if it is supported on L^(1) and its conditional measures on the leaves of ^uu are given by the measures \u03bd_\u03b2_. More precisely, this means that for any box  in L, there is a measure \u03bb on U_ such that for any compactly supported continuous function f:L \u2192, \n\n    \u222b_ f  d\u03bd = \u222b_U_( \u222b_L_y f   d\u03bd_\u03b2_)  d\u03bb(y).\n\n     \nThe measure \u03bb is a so-called `transverse measure' for the horospherical foliation. This means it is a system of measures on sets tranverse to the foliation which is invariant under holonomy along leaves, see <cit.>. The theory of transverse measures implies that (<ref>) serves as a bijection between horospherical measures and transverse measures. We will not be using this point of view in this paper. \n\n\n         \n    \n\nLet \u03d5_t be a smooth flow acting on L. A measure \u03bd is said to be invariant if for any t \u2208 we have (\u03d5_t)_* \u03bd = \u03bd. This definition is equivalent to requiring that the conditional measures of \u03bd on the orbits of \u03d5_t be multiples of the Lebesgue measure dt, i.e., invariant under  the maps \u03d5_s x \u21a6\u03d5_t+sx for any fixed t. The equivalence can be shown by disintegrating \u03bd on flow boxes, i.e., boxes whose horizontal plaques are pieces of \u03d5_t-orbits. By Lemma <ref>, leaves of ^uu are modeled on linear subspaces, and thus one could try and define horospherical measures as those that are invariant under translation along the leaves. However, these translations are not part of a globally defined group action; for instance trajectories might escape to infinity in finite time. To remedy this we adapt the other characterization of invariant measures, where the foliation by orbits of \u03d5_t is replaced by the strong unstable foliation and the translation invariant measure dt is replaced by . \n \n\nIn order to define a notion of horospherical measures on , we first need some terminology: let \u03bd be a Radon measure on  and let \u03bd\u0303 be its pre-image by \u03c0 as in (<ref>) (see also Appendix <ref>). By construction, the measure \u03bd\u0303 is supported on \u03c0^-1(). If L is a lift of , then the restriction of the measure \u03bd\u0303 to L is called the lift of \u03bd corresponding to L. More generally, a lift of \u03bd is a measure of the form \u03bd\u0303|_L where L is any lift of .  For instance, the measures m_L in (<ref>) are the lifts of m_. \n\n[Horospherical measure] A Radon measure \u03bd on  is horospherical if its lifts are horospherical. \n \n\nBy Proposition <ref>, it is enough that one of the lifts is horospherical, as the action of (S,\u03a3) preserves the set of horospherical measures on _m. By definition, a horospherical measure is supported on L^(1). We have the following useful local disintegration formula: \n\n    Let \u03bd be a horospherical measure on . For any regular box\n    \u03c6 : \u2192\n    in \u03c0^-1(), there is a measure \u03bb on U_ such that for any compactly supported continuous function f:\u2192, denoting B=\u03c0() we have\n\n    \u222b_ f  d\u03bd = \u222b_U_( \u222b_L_y f \u2218\u03c0 d\u03bd_)  d\u03bb(y).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet L be a lift of  in which  is contained. We denote by \u0393 the stabilizer in (S,\u03a3) of , and by \u03bd\u0303  the pre-image of \u03bd under \u03c0. By definition, the measure \u03bd\u0303|_L is horospherical,  and we let \u03bb_0 be a measure on _ as in (<ref>). We set \u03bb1/|\u0393|\u03bb_0, and claim that \u03bb satisfies (<ref>). Indeed, let f \u2208 C_c() and assume for now that the support of f is contained in B\u0305. Let h be the function that is equal to f \u2218\u03c0 on  and 0 elsewhere. This function is continuous and its support is contained in  by construction. Using that the stabilizer of  in (S,\u03a3) is also \u0393, we calculate that for any q \u2208, we have \u222b_ h  d\u03b8_q = |\u0393| f(q). We have\n    \n    \u222b_B f  d\u03bd   = 1/|\u0393|\u222b_ h  d\u03bd\u0303 = 1/|\u0393|\u222b_U_( \u222b_L_y f \u2218\u03c0 d\u03bd_)  d\u03bb_0(y),\n \nwhich is what we wanted. In  case the support of f is arbitrary, we pick a sequence \u03c8_n of uniformly bounded smooth functions with support contained in  and that converge pointwise to 1_B, the indicator function of B, and we apply the previous computation to \u03c8_nf in place of f. We have\n\n    \u222b_B \u03c8_n f  d\u03bd = \u222b_U_( \u222b_L_y\u03c8_n f \u2218\u03c0 d\u03bd_)  d\u03bb(y).\n \nPassing to the limit using Lebesgue's dominated convergence, we obtain (<ref>).  \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The special flat measures are horospherical\n\nIn this subsection we prove Theorem <ref>, which gives us our first  examples of horospherical measures. Namely we will show that the Masur-Veech measures on strata, and more generally, the special flat  measures defined in (<ref>), are horospherical.\n\n\nLet  be an invariant subvariety and let L be a lift of . In order to establish Theorem <ref>, we shall first establish that the measure m_L as in (<ref>) is horospherical. This will be achieved in Proposition <ref>. We need some preparatory results. We recall that the measure m_L is obtained by the cone construction applied to \u03bc_L, i.e., for any Borel set A \u2282 L^(1),\n\n    m_L(A) = \u03bc_L(cone(A)),\n\nand the measure \u03bc_L is itself obtained by integration of \u03b1 = \u03b1_\u2227\u03b1_, where \u03b1_ and \u03b1_ are as in (<ref>). Let \u03b2\u03b9_E\u03b1. By construction, \u03b2 induces a volume form on L^(1) and we denote by \u03bc_\u03b2 the measure obtained by integration of \u03b2. The following relates the measure \u03bc_\u03b2 and the cone measure m_L. \n\n We have \n\n    \u03bc_\u03b2 = () \u00b7 m_L.\n\n\n\n\nThe proof is an application of Stokes' theorem. It follows from (<ref>) that the Lie derivative of \u03b1 with respect to the Euler vector field satisfies \u2112_E(\u03b1) = () \u00b7\u03b1. Let U be an open set in L^(1) contained in one chart for the manifold structure on L. Notice that the only part of the boundary \u2202cone(U) of cone(U) to which E is not tangent is U itself. In particular, the only part of \u2202cone(U) on which \u03b9_E\u03b1 does not vanish is U. We have from Stokes' formula (for manifolds with corners, see e.g. <cit.>) that\n\n    \u222b_cone(U) d(\u03b9_E \u03b1) = \u222b_\u2202cone(U)\u03b9_E\u03b1 = \u222b_U \u03b9_E\u03b1 = \u03bc_\u03b2(U).\n\nIt follows from the Cartan formula  that \u2112_E(\u03b1) = d \u03b9_E \u03b1 + \u03b9_E d \u03b1. Since \u03b1 is closed, we deduce that d \u03b9_E(\u03b1)= \u2112_E(\u03b1). Gathering everything, we obtain\n\n    () \u00b7 m_L(U) = \u03bc_\u03b2(U).\n \nThis is true for all U as above, and these open sets generate the Borel \u03c3-algebra on L^(1).\n\n\nWe introduce two new vector fields E_ and E_ on :\n\n    E_x() \u2202/\u2202 t|_t=0[ e^t   0;   0   1 ]\u00b7   and    E_y() \u2202/\u2202 t|_t=0[   1   0;   0 e^t ]\u00b7.\n\nBy definition we have E = E_x + E_y, and for any \u2208, we have\n\n    \u2202/\u2202 t|_t=0 g_t \u00b7 = E_x() - E_y().\n\n\nFor the proof of Theorem <ref>, we will also need the following calculation: \n  The restrictions of the forms\n  \u03b1_ and \u03b1_ to L^(1) satisfy\n   \n    \u03b9_E (\u03b1_\u2227\u03b1_) = 2 (\u03b9_E \u03b1_) \u2227\u03b1_.\n\n  \n\n\n\nLet n = (). We begin by observing that on restriction to L^(1), we have\n  \n    \u03b9_(E_-E_)(\u03b1_\u2227\u03b1_)=0.\n\nIndeed, we deduce from (<ref>) that E_x-E_y is tangent to L^(1). In particular, since L^(1) has dimension 2n-1 (as a real vector space), any family of 2n-1 linearly independent vector fields that are tangent to L^(1) contain E_ - E_ in their span. This implies (<ref>). \n\n\nNow we calculate:\n\n    \u03b9_E(\u03b1_\u2227\u03b1_)    = \u03b9_2E_ - (E_-E_) (\u03b1_\u2227\u03b1_)\n       (<ref>)= 2\u03b9_E_(\u03b1_\u2227\u03b1_) = 2\u03b9_E_\u03b1_\u2227\u03b1_ + (-1)^n\u03b1_\u2227\u03b9_E_x\u03b1_.\n\nThe last equality follows from the Leibniz formula for contractions \n\n    \u03b9_V(\u03b1\u2227\u03b2)=(\u03b9_V\u03b1)\u2227\u03b2+(-1)^(  \u03b1)\u03b1\u2227\u03b9_V\u03b2.\n\nNow, notice that E_ is tangent to the fibers of \u03c0_\u2218. Since \u03b1_ = (\u03c0_\u2218)^\u2217\u03b7_, we deduce that \u03b9_E_\u03b1_ = 0. Similarly, we prove that \u03b9_E_\u03b1_ = 0 and thus \n\n    \u03b9_E(\u03b1_\u2227\u03b1_) = 2\u03b9_E_\u03b1_ = 2\u03b9_E\u03b1_.\n \n\n\n\n    The measure m_L is horospherical. \n\n\n\nIt follows from Lemma <ref> that m_L is given, up to a multiplicative constant, by integration of the differential form \u03b2 = \u03b9_E( \u03b1_\u2227\u03b1_). Lemma <ref> implies that \u03b2 = 2 \u03b2_\u2227\u03b1_.  Notice that both the forms \u03b2_ and \u03b1_ are basic, i.e., they are obtained by pullback of forms on \ud835\udc0f(V_) and V_ by the projections \u2218\u03c0_' and \u2218\u03c0_. Indeed, we have \u03b1_ = (\u2218\u03c0_)^\u2217\u03b7_y and using Lemma <ref>, we can build a differential form \u03b2_' on \ud835\udc0f(V_) such that (\u2218\u03c0_')^\u2217\u03b2_' = \u03b2_x.\n\nNow, let \u03c6 : \u2192 be a box in L^(1) and let f \u2208 C_c(L). Notice that \u03c6^\u2217\u03b1_ = \u03b7_ and \u03c6^\u2217\u03b2_ = \u03b2_'. We have: \n\n    \u222b_ f \u00b7\u03b2_\u2227\u03b1_   = \u222b_ f \u2218\u03c6\u00b7\u03b2_' \u2227\u03b7_\n       =  \u222b_U_( \u222b_U_' \u00d7{y} f \u2218\u03c6\u00b7\u03b2_' ) \u00b7\u03b7_\n       =  \u222b_U_( \u222b__y f \u00b7\u03b2_) \u00b7\u03b7_.\n\nIf we let \u03bb be the measure on U_ given by integration of the form 2/()\u00b7\u03b7_y, we obtain \n\n    \u222b_ f  dm_L = \u222b_U_( \u222b__y f  d)  d \u03bb(y).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy definition, in order to prove that m_ is horospherical, we need to show that the lifts of m_ are horospherical. We recall from (<ref>) that the lifts of m_ are given by the m_L. Theorem <ref> is then a consequence of Proposition <ref>.  \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The horocycle flow, real REL, and horospherical measures\n\nIn this subsection we will show that the horocycle flow and the real Rel deformations move surfaces inside their horospherical leaf, and preserve horospherical measures. \n\n\n\nHorospheres and horospherical measures are horocycle flow-invariant. \n\n\n\n\n For \u2208_m with () = (x, y) and s \u2208, we have \n  \n    (u_s ) = (x + sy, y).\n\n This implies that the horocycle flow maps ^uu() to itself and since \u03c0 is -equivariant, we deduce that horospheres are preserved by the horocycle flow.  \n\nWe also deduce from (<ref>) that the horocycle flow preserves the form \u03b1_. Since the horocycle flow commutes with the rescaling action, it also preserves the Euler vector field, from which we deduce that for any s \u2208 we have u_s^\u2217 =. In particular, the horocycle flow preserves the measures \u03bd_. \n\n\nLet \u03bd be a horospherical measure and let s_0 >0. We claim that for any q \u2208 such that the orbit segment {u_sq : s\u2208,  |s| \u2264 s_0 } is embedded, i.e., Uq is not a periodic horocycle orbit with period of length smaller than 2s_0, there is an open set \u2282 containing q such that for any compactly supported continuous function f with support contained in \ud835\udcb0 and any s \u2208 with |s| \u2264 s_0,  we have:  \n\n    \u222b_ f\u2218 u_s d\u03bd = \u222b_ f  d\u03bd.\n\nTo see this, let \u2208 be such that \u03c0()=q and define\n\n    \u03c3{ u_s  : s \u2208,  |s| \u2264 s_0 }.\n\n\nLet \u0393 be the stabilizer in (S,\u03a3) of . Since the -action on  commutes with (S,\u03a3), the group \u0393 acts trivially on \u03c3 and since Uq is not a periodic orbit with period smaller than 2s_0, we have that that \u03c3\u00b7\u03b3\u2229\u03c3 = \u2205 for any \u03b3\u2208(S,\u03a3), unless \u03b3\u2208\u0393. By thickening \u03c3, we can find a box \u2282\u03c0^-1() containing \u03c3 and up to replacing  with  \u2229_\u03b3\u2208\u0393\u00b7\u03b3, we can assume that  is regular. By construction, for any s \u2208 with |s| \u2264 s_0, the surface u_sq belongs to B = \u03c0() and lies on the plaque of q. Since the horocycle flow acts continuously, there is a neighborhood \u2282 around q such that for any ' \u2208\u03c0^-1() \u2229 and |s| \u2264 s_0, we have u_s ' \u2208. Let \u03bb be a transverse measure on U_, i.e., a measure as in (<ref>), and let f be a continuous function with support contained in \ud835\udcb0. It follows from (<ref>) that\n\n    \u222b_ f \u2218 u_s d \u03bd   = \u222b_U_(\n        \u222b_L_y f \u2218 u_s\u2218\u03c0 d \u03bd_)  d\u03bb(y)\n       = \u222b_U_( \u222b_L_y f  \u2218\u03c0 d u_s_\u2217\u03bd_)  d\u03bb(y)\n       = \u222b_U_( \u222b_L_y f  \u2218\u03c0 d  \u03bd_)  d\u03bb(y) = \u222b_ f  d\u03bd.\n\nThe second equality follows from the fact that \u03c0 is -equivariant and the fact that for any y \u2208 U_, the action of u_s maps supp(f \u2218\u03c0) \u2229L_y inside L_y, which in turns is implied by our choice of  and the fact that the horocycle flow maps the leaves of ^uu into themselves.  \n\n\nFor any f \u2208 C_c(), define\n\n    s_f inf{s >0 : supp(f)  contains a periodic surface of period s }.\n\nIt is easy to see that s_f is always positive, and using the first part of the proof together with a partition of unity argument, we can show that (<ref>) holds for f and s \u2208 with |s| \u2264 s_f. Furthermore, notice that for any s \u2208, we have s_f = s_f \u2218 u_s. Writing s=ks' with k \u2208\u2115 and |s'| \u2264 s_f, we obtain\n\n    \u222b_ f \u2218 u_s d\u03bd = \u222b_ f \u2218 u_(k-1)s' d\u03bd = \u22ef = \u222b_ f  d\u03bd.\n\nThis proves that \u03bd is horocycle flow-invariant. \n\n\n\nFor any irreducible invariant subvariety , we let\n\n    Z_ V \u2229 Z,\n\nwhere V is the model space of any lift of \u03c0^-1(). Notice that the space Z_ actually does not depend on the choice of particular lift. This is a consequence of Proposition <ref> together with with the fact that (S,\u03a3) acts trivially on (). \n\n\nLet v \u2208 Z_, q \u2208, and suppose  _v(q) is defined. Then _v(q) \u2208 W^uu(q). If \u03bd is a horospherical measure and _v(q) is defined for \u03bd-a.e. q, then \u03bd is invariant  under the (almost everywhere defined) map q \u21a6_v(q).\n\n\n\nLet Z^(q) be as in (<ref>). Since Z_\u2282 V, where V is the subspace that  is modeled on, we have _v(q) \u2208 if q \u2208 and v \u2208 Z_\u2229 Z^(q). The only properties of the horocycle flow which were used in the proof of Proposition <ref> are that u_s_0 preserves the horospheres, and  acts on them by translations. The same properties are valid for the action of _v for v \u2208 Z_. Indeed, _v sends surfaces of area one to surfaces of area one, and if () = (x,y) then (_v ) = (x + v , y). \n\n\n\n If a measure \u03bc on  is saddle-connection free, then for \u03bc-a.e. q \u2208, _v(q) is defined for every v \u2208 Z_, and satisfies the `group law' property \n\n    \u2200 v_1, v_2 \u2208 Z_,   _v_1( _v_2(q) ) = _v_1+v_2(q).\n\nFollowing <cit.>, we say that an irreducible invariant subvariety  is of rank one if ((V))=2,\nwhere V is the model space of any lift of \u03c0^-1(). In the rank one case we have the following converse to Propositions <ref> and <ref>: \n\n    If  is an invariant subvariety of rank one and \u03bc is a saddle connection-free measure, then \u03bc is horospherical if and only if it is invariant under the horocycle and the real Rel flows. \n\n\n\nBy a dimension count, we see that when  has rank one, the dimension of horospheres is the same as (Z_)+1. This means that the horosphere W^uu(q) satisfies \n\n    W^uu(q) = {_v(u_sq): s \u2208,  v \u2208 Z_},\n\nthat is the group action generated by the  horocycle flow and real Rel acts transitively on the horospheres. \nAs we saw in the proofs of Propositions <ref> and <ref>, this action is by translations, with respect to the affine structure on W^uu(q) afforded by Lemma <ref>. Since the measures \u03bd_\u03b2_ are the unique (up to scaling) translation-invariant  measures on the affine manifolds L^(1), the invariance of \u03bc under the horocycle and real Rel flows implies that the conditional measures on the plaques in a box are given by \u03bd_\u03b2_.\n    \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Further properties\n\nLet X be a manifold with a foliation, and a Borel measure \u03bc. We say that \u03bc is ergodic for the foliation if any Borel subset A which is a union of leaves satisfies either \u03bc(A)=0 or \u03bc(X  A)=0. For instance we have:\n\n\n\nThe special flat measure on an invariant subvariety is ergodic for the horospherical foliation.\n\n\n\nThis follows from Proposition <ref> and the ergodicity of the special flat measure with respect to the U-action. \n\n\n\nDenote by  \ud835\udcab^(uu)() the collection of horospherical measures on  with total mass at most one. The following standard results in ergodic theory are valid in the context of horospherical measures:\n\n\nFor the horospherical foliation on any invariant subvariety ^(1), we have:\n\n    \n  * The space \ud835\udcab^(uu)(), with the weak-* topology, is a compact convex set. \n    \n  * A horospherical probability measure is ergodic if and only if it is an extreme point of  \ud835\udcab^(uu)(). \n    \n  * For any probability measure \u03bc\u2208\ud835\udcab^(uu)() there is a probability  space (\u0398, \u03b7) and a measurable map \u0398\u2192\ud835\udcab^(uu)(),  \u03b8\u21a6\u03bd_\u03b8, such that \u03bd_\u03b8 is ergodic and a probability measure for \u03b7-a.e. \u03b8, and \u03bc = \u222b_\u0398\u03bd_\u03b8  d\u03b7(\u03b8).\n    \n  * If \u03bc_1, \u03bc_2 \u2208\ud835\udcab^(uu)() such that \u03bc_1 \u226a\u03bc_2, and \u03bc_2 is  ergodic, then \u03bc_1 = c\u03bc_2 for some c \u2265 0. \n\n  \n\n\n\nIt is clear from definitions that if \u03bc_1, \u03bc_2 \u2208\ud835\udcab^(uu)(), and \u03b1\u2208 (0,1), then \u03b1\u03bc_1 +(1- \u03b1)\u03bc_2 \u2208\ud835\udcab^(uu)(). It is also clear that condition (<ref>), and the condition \u03bc() \u2264 1, are both closed conditions. This proves the first assertion. The remaining assertions follow from Choquet's theorem by standard arguments, see e.g. <cit.>. \n\n\n\nWe say that two surfaces q, q' \u2208 are horizontally equivalent if there is a homeomorphism M_q\u2192 M_q' of the underlying surfaces, that preserves the labels of singularities and maps the horizontal saddle connections of M_q bijectively to those of M_q'.  Note that a horizontal equivalence only preserves certain horizontal structure. It preserves saddle connections but need not preserve the horizontal foliation.\n  \n\nAny two surfaces in the same horospherical leaf are horizontally equivalent. \n\n\n\nIt suffices to show this upstairs; that is, we let , ' \u2208_m with ' \u2208^uu(), let f: S \u2192 M_q and f': S \u2192 M_q' be marking maps representing , ' and show that f' \u2218 f^-1 gives a bijection of horizontal saddle connections. We first discuss ' \u2208^uu() which are sufficiently close to . Let f: S \u2192 M_q be a marking map representing  and let \u03c3_1, \u2026, \u03c3_r be the horizontal saddle connections on M_q. Using  a neighborhood \ud835\udcb0_\u03c4 corresponding to a fixed triangulation \u03c4 of S, we see that there is a neighborhood \ud835\udcb0 of  such that for any surface ' \u2208\ud835\udcb0, represented by f': S \u2192 M_q', the paths f'\u2218 f^-1(\u03c3_i) are represented by saddle connections on M_q'. Furthermore, if ' \u2208\ud835\udcb0\u2229^uu() then these paths are horizontal saddle connections, so that f' \u2218 f^-1: M_q \u2192 M_q' is a homeomorphism mapping the horizontal saddle connections of M_q injectively to horizontal saddle connections on M_q'.\n\nNow choose _max\u2208^uu() so that it has the maximal number of horizontal saddle connections. We will show that the set \ud835\udcb1 of surfaces in ^uu() which are horizontally equivalent to _max is open and closed, and this will conclude the proof. By the preceding discussion, \ud835\udcb1 is open in ^uu(). Furthermore, if _n \u2192_\u221e is a convergent sequence of surfaces in ^uu(), with _n \u2208\ud835\udcb1, then the horizontal saddle connections on the surfaces M_q_n have length bounded uniformly from above and below, and so converge to paths on M_q_\u221e which are represented by horizontal saddle connections or by finite concatenations of horizontal saddle connections. Thus _\u221e has at least the same number of saddle connections as _max, and so, by maximality, _\u221e\u2208\ud835\udcb1. This completes the proof. \n\n\n\nFrom Proposition <ref> we deduce: \n  \n\nIf \u03bd is an ergodic horospherical measure then there is a subset ' \u2282 of full \u03bd-measure such any two surfaces in ' are horizontally equivalent. \n\n\n\nIn <cit.>, using boundary marked surfaces, topological horizontal equivalence is  introduced. In this definition the homeomorphism M_q \u2192 M_q' is required to preserve additional structure, e.g. the angular differences between saddle connections at each singular point. Proposition <ref> and Corollary <ref> hold for this finer notion of equivalence as well.  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SADDLE CONNECTION FREE HOROSPHERICAL MEASURES\n \nIn this section we will prove Theorem <ref>. We first state and prove some auxiliary statements.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The Jacobian distortion in a box\n\n\nThe different plaques in a box can be compared to each other using the structure of a box. Namely, let \u03c6: \u2192\u2282 L^(1) be a box. For any point y \u2208 U_ we define\n\n    \u03c6_y: U'_\u2192_y,     \u03c6_y([x] ) \u03c6([x],y),\n \nwhere _y is the plaque of y in  (see Definition <ref>). \n\nFor any two points y_0 and y_1 in U_, the map \u03c6_y_0,y_1\u03c6_y_1\u2218\u03c6_y_0^-1 is a diffeomorphism between the plaques _y_0 and _y_1 in B, identifying points parameterized by the same point in U'_. Define\n\n    \u03b4_y_1 : _y_0\u2192,    \u03b4_y_1 ( ) \u27e8 x_, y_1 \u27e9^-(),\n\nwhere x_ = \u03c0_\u2218(). The diffeomorphism \u03c6_y_0,y_1 is not measure preserving. Instead, we have the following: \n\n (Jacobian calculation) \nFor any two points y_0, y_1 \u2208 U_ we have\n\n\n    (\u03c6_y_0,y_1)^\u2217(|__y_1) = \u03b4_y_1\u00b7(|__y_0).\n\n\n\n\n \nFor any y \u2208 U_, write \n\n    L\u0305_y \u03c0_\u2218 (_y),\n\nwhere \u03c0_ is the projection in (<ref>). Then L\u0305_y is an open subset of an affine hyperplane in V_, which is a translate of\n\n    {x \u2208 V_: \u27e8 x, y \u27e9 =0}.\n\nBy Definition <ref> the map\n\n    F: L\u0305_y \u2192_y,     F(x ) \u03c6([x], y)\n\nis a diffeomorphism with inverse \u03c0_\u2218. We denote by e_ the Euler vector field on V_. Notice that F^* \u03b2_ is the restriction to L\u0305_y of \u03b9_e_\u03b7_. Indeed, we calculate\n\n    F^* \u03b2_ = F^* \u03b9_E (\u03c0_\u2218^* \u03b7_)  =  F^* (\u03c0_\u2218) ^* (\u03b9_e_\u03b7_) = \u03b9_E_ (\u03b7_).\n\nThe map F gives a chart of _y in which \u03b2_ is  \u03b9_e_\u03b7_.  We shall perform our calculation in these charts and verify (<ref>) in L\u0305_y instead of L_y. Let y_0, y_1 \u2208 U_, and set\n\n    h: L\u0305_y_1\u2192,       h(x) 1/\u27e8 x, y_1 \u27e9.\n\nThe map \u03c6_y_0, y_1 : L_y_0\u2192 L_y_1 is expressed in charts simply as the map \n\n    \u03c6\u0305_y_0, y_1: L\u0305_y_0\u2192L\u0305_y_1,   \u03c6\u0305_y_0, y_1(x) =  h(x)   x.\n\nThis implies by the multivariable product rule that\n\n    (D \u03c6\u0305_y_0, y_1)_x(v) = h(x)   v + (Dh)_x(v)   x.\n\nHence, for v_1, \u2026, v_d-1 in the tangent space to L\u0305_y_0 at x, denoting n = () we have:\n\n    ((\u03c6\u0305_y_0, y_1)^* \u03b9_e_\u03b7_x )_x (v_1,\u2026 , v_d-1)  \n     =     (\u03b9_e_\u03b7_x)_\u03c6\u0305_y_0, y_1(x)(D_x\u03c6\u0305_y_0, y_1(v_1), \u2026, D_x\u03c6\u0305_y_0, y_1(v_d-1) ) \n    \n        =    (\u03b7_)_h(x)x (h(x)x, h(x)v_1 + D_xh(v_1)   x, \u2026, h(x)v_d-1+ D_xh(v_d-1)   x)\n     \n        =   (\u03b7_)_h(x)x (h(x)x, h(x)v_1,\u2026,h(x)v_d-1 ) =h(x)^n (\u03b9_e_\u03b7_)_x(v_1,\u2026,v_d-1).\n\nThis is Formula  (<ref>). \n\n\nNotice that for any y_0,y_1 \u2208 U_ and [x] \u2208 U_', we have \n\n    \u03b4_y_1\u2218\u03c6_y_0([x]) = ( \u27e8 x, y_0\u27e9/\u27e8 x, y_1\u27e9)^().\n\nThis leads us to define the distortion of  as follows: \n\n    \u03b4_sup{|1 - (\u27e8 x, y_0 \u27e9/\u27e8 x, y_1 \u27e9) ^d | : [x] \u2208 U'_,   y_0, y_1 \u2208 U_}.\n \n\n \nThe quantity \u27e8 x, y_0\u27e9/\u27e8 x, y_1\u27e9\nhas the following geometric interpretation. The points \u03c6([x],y_0) and \u03c6([x],y_1) are in the same weak stable leaf, and this leaf is further foliated by strong stable leaves. The geodesic flow maps a given weak stable leaf to itself, permuting the strong stable leaves inside it. The choice t = log(\u27e8 x, y_0\u27e9/\u27e8 x, y_1\u27e9) is the value of t\u2208 for which g_t maps \u03c6([x], y_0) to the strong stable leaf of \u03c6([x], y_1).  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe distortion can be used to bound the variation of the mass of the horospherical plaques of  with respect to the measures \u03bd_. Indeed, by an easy change of variables, using \u03c6_y_0,y_1 we have  \n\n    |  (_y_1) - (_y_0) | \u2264\u03b4_ (_y_0).\n\nFrom this it follows that\n\n    | (_y_1)/(_y_0) - 1 | \u2264\u03b4_.\n\n\nThe distortion of a box is well-behaved with respect to the geodesic flow. For t \u2208 and any  in \u03c0^-1(), we write\n\n    _t  g_t()     and   B_t \u03c0(_t).\n\n\n\nLet  be a box in \u03c0^-1(). Then _t is a box with \u03b4__t = \u03b4_ and it is regular whenever  is.  \n\n\n Let \u03c6: U'_\u00d7 U_\u2192 L^(1) be the parametrization of , where L is an irreducible component of \u03c0^-1() and let U\u0305_ be the image of U_ under multiplication by e^-t, and let \u03c6\u0305 ([x], y)  g_t \u2218\u03c6 ([x], e^ty). Using the fact that the geodesic flow preserves the splitting into stable and horospherical foliation, and acts on V_ by multiplication by e^-t, we see that \u03c6\u0305: U'_\u00d7U\u0305_\u2192 L^(1)_1 is a parameterization of _t as in Definition <ref>. Also, for i=0,1,  if ([x], y\u0305_i) \u2208 U'_\u00d7U\u0305_, where y\u0305_i = e^-ty_i, then\n\n    \u27e8 x, y\u0305_0 \u27e9/\u27e8 x, y\u0305_1 \u27e9 =\n    \u27e8 x, y_0 \u27e9/\u27e8 x, y_1 \u27e9.\n\n\nThis implies that the distortion of  is the same as the distortion of _t. \n\nThe last statement simply follows from the fact that the actions of  and (S,\u03a3) commute. \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Thickness of a box\n \nWe now introduce the notion of the thickness of a box.\n\n\n\n      \nTo define this quantity we use the sup-norm Finsler metric of <ref> to induce a distance function on leaves of the stable foliation. We rely on work of Avila and Gouezel <cit.>, who defined a similar distance function on the leaves of the strong stable foliation.\n\n\nFor a subset of a stable leaf, we denote by diam^(s) its diameter with respect to the distance function dist^(s).  We define the thickness of the box  as\n\n    \u03c4_[x] \u2208 U'_supdiam^(s) \u03c6( {[x]}\u00d7 U_) ;\n\nthat is, the maximal diameter of a plaque for the stable foliation. \n\nWe will need boxes whose thickness is also well-behaved under the geodesic flow. Similarly to Proposition <ref>, we have: \n\nFor any >0 and any \u2208\u03c0^-1(^(1)), there is a regular box  in \u03c0^-1() containing  such that for any t\u2265 0, \u03c4__t\u2264.  \n\n\n\nIn the thickness discussion we would like to know\n  that under the forward geodesic flow lengths of paths in the leaves\n  of the weak stable foliation do not grow when we apply the geodesic\n  flow. AG prove this for the strong stable foliation. (Recall the\n  confusing notation remark.) We also know (AG) that the lengths of\n  geodesic paths do not grow. To connect two points in a weak stable\n  leaf we can concatenate a weak stable path and a geodesic path. The\n  length of this path is an upperbound for distance. If our boxes have\n  controlled diameter in both the strong stable direction and the\n  geodesic direction we can show that the lengths of weak stable paths\n  do not grow under the geodesic flow. Observe that the \u201cgeodesic\n  width\" is bounded by |log\u27e8 x, y_0  \u27e9/\u27e8\n   x,  y_1  \u27e9| (see previous \u201cgeometric interpretation\") so in\n  fact we have already bounded it in the discussion giving a bound for\n  \u03b4. \n\nConnection between d^s and d: d\u2264 d^s and if\n  both are small they are comparable in size for points in the strong\n  stable manifold. It follows from AG Prop. 5.3 that distance less\n  than 1/25 implies distortion less than 2. \nadd the above discussion to the proof of Prop. 4.2.\n\n\n\n\nLet L be a lift of  that contains  and let \u0393 be the stabilizer in (S,\u03a3) of . Since (S,\u03a3) acts properly discontinuously on , there is a neighborhood  containing  such that for any \u03b3\u2208(S,\u03a3), either \u00b7\u0393\u2229 = \u2205 or \u03b3\u2208\u0393. By Lemma <ref>, let \u2282 be a box containing  and let \u03c6\u0305 :  U\u0305'_\u00d7U\u0305_\u2192 be the parametrization of . Let () = (x_0, y_0), let \u00db'_ be a neighborhood of [x_0] whose closure is contained in U\u0305'_, and let\n\n\n    \ud835\udc02\u03c6_1(\u00db'_\u00d7{y_0}).\n\nThat is, \ud835\udc02 is a bounded subset of a horospherical leaf, contained in a plaque of , and with closure in the interior of . Let _1 \u2208 (0, /4) be small enough so that \n\n    \ud835\udc02_1 \u22c3_|t| \u2264_1g_t (\ud835\udc02) \u2282,\n\nand let _2 \u2208(0, /4) such that \n\n    \ud835\udc02_2 \u22c3__1 \u2208\ud835\udc02_1{_2 \u2208^ss(_1)  : dist^(ss)(_1, _2) < _2 }\n\nis contained in . Such numbers _1, _2 exist because \ud835\udc02 is bounded, and \ud835\udc02_2 contains a neighborhood of . We can therefore let U'_\u2282\u00db'_ and U_\u2282U\u0305_ be small enough open sets so that = \u03c6\u0305 (U'_\u00d7 U_) contains  and is contained in \ud835\udc02_2. Since  is contained in , we may replace  by \u2229_\u03b3\u2208\u0393\u00b7\u03b3 and we can assume that  is regular, with stabilizer \u0393. \n\nFor \u2208, let ^s() be the plaque through  for the weak stable foliation, that is, the connected component of  in \u2229^s(). For each _2 \u2208 there is a point _0, which is the unique point in the intersection \ud835\udc02\u2229^s(_2), and a path from _0 to _2 which is a concatenation of two paths \u03b3_1 and \u03b3_2. The path \u03b3_1={g_t_0 : t \u2208 I } from _0 to _1 goes along a geodesic arc, where I is an interval of length at most _1. The path \u03b3_2 from _1 to _2 has sup-norm length at most _2 and is contained in ^ss(_2). Since _1, _2 < /4, each point in any stable plaque in  is within distance at most /2 from the unique point at the  intersection of this plaque with \ud835\udc02, where the distance is measured using the distance function dist^(s). Concatenating such paths we see that the diameter of any stable plaque in  is at most , and this implies the same bound for stable plaques in B. That is, the thickness of B is less than . By Proposition <ref>, the lengths of geodesic paths and of paths in strong  stable leaves, do not increase when pushed by g_t for t \u2265 0. Thus the same argument (using the pushes of \u03b3_1 and \u03b3_2 by g_t) give the required upper bound on the thickness of _t. \n\n\n\nFor a compactly supported continuous function f on , we denote by \u03c9_f its continuity modulus with respect to the sup-norm distance function. That is, \u03c9_f(t) \u2192_t \u2192 0+0 and \n\n    |f(q_1) - f(q_2)| \u2264\u03c9_f(dist(q_1, q_2))     for any  q_1, q_2 \u2208.\n\n\nThe following key lemma says that for any horospherical measure \u03bd, any regular box  and any test function f, the integral of f with respect to \u03bd|_B can be approximated by the integral of f \u2218\u03c0 with respect to  on any one horospherical plaque of , provided that  has small distortion and small thickness.  We recall that B \u2282 is defined as the image of  by \u03c0. \n\n\nLet \u03bd be a horospherical measure, let f \u2208 C_c (^(1)) and let  be a regular box such that \u03bd(B)>0.

The first fact we deduce from it is the following:  \n\n\n Let \u03bd be a saddle connection free horospherical measure and let \u03b4>0. Then there is a regular box \u2282\u03c0^-1(), a constant c>0 and an unbounded increasing sequence of times t_i such that:\n\n\n    \n  *  For all i \u2265 0, \u03bd(_t_i) > c\u03bd (), where _t_i = \u03c0(_t_i).\n    \n  *  Both the thickness and distortion of each _t_i are smaller than \u03b4. \n  \nIn particular it follows from (a) that \u03bd is finite. \n\n\n\nLet K be a compact subset as in Lemma <ref> for \u03b5 = 1/2, c=1, and denote \u03bd_t  (g_-t)_\u2217\u03bd. By Proposition <ref>, \u03bd is U-invariant, and since g_t normalizes U, the same holds for \u03bd_t. An application of a generalisation  of the Birkhoff ergodic theorem for locally finite measures (see <cit.> for a general formulation) to the function 1_K shows that there is a function f \u2208 L^1(\u03bd_t) such that f_L^1(\u03bd_t)\u22641_K_L^1(\u03bd_t) = \u03bd_t(K) and for \u03bd_t-almost every q \u2208^(1), \n\n    1/T| { s \u2208 [0,T] :  u_s  q \u2208 K}| T \u2192\u221e\u27f6 f(q).\n\n\nSince the {g_t}-action preserves the property of having horizontal\nsaddle connections, \u03bd_t is also saddle connection free and thus by\nLemma <ref>,  we have almost surely\nf(q)>1/2.

By Lemma <ref>, the distortion of g_t(_j) is also less than \u03b4 for each j and each t \u2265 0. Let c 1/2N.

We assume first that \u03bd is ergodic for the horospherical foliation. We will show that the special flat measure m_ is absolutely continuous with respect to \u03bd. To see this, let A be a Borel set of positive measure for m_. Since m_ is a Radon measure, in particular inner regular, there is a compact K contained in A such that m_(K) > 0. Let U be an open set that contains A and let  f:^(1)\u2192 [0,1] be a continuous function whose support is contained in U and that evaluates to 1 on K. Such a function exists by Urysohn's Lemma. Let \u03b5 >0, and choose \u03b4>0 so that\n\n\n    \u03c9_f(\u03b4) + 2f_\u221e\u03b4 < .\n\n\nBy Lemma <ref>, there is c>0,  a regular box  and t_i \u2192\u221e such that\nfor each i, \u03c4__t_i < \u03b4 and \u03b4_ < \u03b4, and \u03bd(B_t_i) \u2265 c \u03bd (). Applying Lemma\n<ref> to both  \u03bd and m_ we obtain\n\n\n    | 1/\u03bd(B_t_i)\u222b__t_i f  d\u03bd -1/m_ (_t_i)\u222b_B_t_i f  dm_| <2\u03b5.\n\n\nBy mixing of the geodesic flow with respect to m_, there is i>0 large enough such that m_(B_t_i\u2229 K) > m_(B) (m_(K) - \u03b5). Therefore: \n\n\n    \u03bd(U)/c  \u03bd(^(1))\u2265   \u03bd(U)/\u03bd(_t_i)\u22651/\u03bd(_t_i)\u222b__t_i f   d\u03bd\n      \n         >    1/m_(_t_i)\u222b__t_i f   dm_ - 2\u03b5\n    \u2265   m_(_t_i\u2229 K)/m_(_t_i) -2\u03b5 > m_(K)-3\u03b5.\n \nSince \u03b5 was chosen arbitrarily, we have proven  \u03bd(U)\n\u2265 c  \u03bd ()   m_(K). We deduce by inner regularity of the\nmeasure \u03bd that \u03bd(A) is positive. This completes the proof that m_\u226a\u03bd.\n\nIt follows from Proposition <ref> that m_ = c\u03bd for some c \u2265 0, and since m_ is nonzero, c>0 and \u03bd = 1/c m_.  For general \u03bd, we obtain from the case just discussed  that all the ergodic components of the measure \u03bd are proportional to the special flat measure and thus \u03bd itself is proportional to the special flat measure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 EXAMPLES OF HOROSPHERICAL MEASURES\n\nThe simplest example of a horospherical measure which is not the special flat measure occurs when  is a closed -orbit. In this case the leaves of the horospherical foliation are the U-orbits, and the length measure on a closed periodic U-orbit is a horospherical measure; indeed, in this case, the transverse measure \u03bb in (<ref>) is atomic.\n\nIn order to obtain more complicated examples, we use the following:\n\n\nLet W^uu(q) be a closed horosphere in . Then W^uu(q) is the support of a horospherical measure \u03bd whose lifts are the measures \u03bd_,^L where L is a lift of  and \u03c0() = q.   \n\n  \n\nThe horosphere W^uu(q) is closed if and only the collection {^uu() } is locally finite, where  ranges over \u03c0^-1(q) and L ranges over the lifts of  that contain . Each of the ^uu() carries the Radon measure \u03bd_,^L and the measure \n\n    \u03bd\u0303\u2211\u03bd_,^L\n\nis a (S,\u03a3)-invariant Radon measure on \u03c0^-1(). Let \u03bd be the Radon measure on  whose lift is \u03bd\u0303 (see Proposition <ref>). The measure \u03bd is horospherical by construction. \n\n\n\n\nTo construct an example of a closed horosphere, we use horizontally periodic surfaces, i.e., surfaces which can be represented as a finite union of horizontal cylinders. Let = \u210b(1,1). This stratum is an invariant subvariety of dimension 5, and thus its horospherical leaves have real dimension 4. Let a,b be real numbers with a, b  \u2208 (0,1) and 0 < b < min(a, 1-a), let \u03c4_1, \u03c4_2 \u2208\ud835\udd4a^1  /\u2124,  and set \u03c4\u0305_1   a\u03c4_1 and \u03c4\u0305_2  (1-a)\u03c4_2, so that \u03c4\u0305_1, \u03c4\u0305_2 take values in circles of circumference a, 1-a respectively. Define the surface q=q_a,b, \u03c4_1, \u03c4_2\u2208 by the polygonal representation shown in Figure <ref>. In the horizontal direction it is comprised of two cylinders, each of height 0.5, and of areas 0.5a and 0.5(1-a). The parameters \u03c4_1, \u03c4_2 are called twist parameters. Changing them by adding an integer amounts to performing the corresponding number of Dehn twists in the two cylinders, and thus does not change the surface q.\n\n\n\nIt is clear that varying  the parameters a, b, \u03c4_1, \u03c4_2 results in surfaces that belong to the horospherical leaf of q, and thus, by a dimension count, they locally parameterize the leaf of q. In either of the cases b\u2192 0, b \u2192min(a, 1 a), the surface q_a,b, \u03c4_1, \u03c4_2 has shorter and shorter horizontal saddle connections on the boundaries of the cylinders, and thus exits compact subsets of ^(1). This means that the horosphere W^uu(q) is closed and that the map \n\n    \ud835\udd4a^1 \u00d7\ud835\udd4a^1 \u00d7{(a,b) \u2208 (0,1)^2  :  0<  b < min(a, 1-a)}\u2192^(1)   (a,b,\u03c4_1, \u03c4_2) \u21a6 q_a,b,\u03c4_1, \u03c4_2\n \nis a proper homeomorphism onto W^uu(q).\n\nIt can be checked that in this case the map (a,b, \u03c4\u0305_1, \u03c4\u0305_2)\n\u21a6(q_a,b,\u03c4_1, \u03c4_2 ) is affine in charts. Thus the horospherical measure can be written explicitly (up to scaling) as  d\u03bd(q_a,b,\u03c4_1, \u03c4_2) =  da   db   d\u03c4\u0305_1   d\u03c4\u0305_2. \n\n\nFor the horospherical measure constructed in the preceding example, the space Z_ (defined in (<ref>) is one dimensional, and for every surface q in  the support of this measure, Z^(q) (defined in (<ref>)) is a bounded interval. Moreover, for any v \u2208 Z_ there is a positive measure set of surfaces q (with small values of a) for which _v(q) is not defined. This shows that the hypothesis in Proposition <ref>, that _v(q) is defined, is not always satisfied.\n\n\n\nIt is no coincidence that the closed horopsheres in the two preceding examples consist of horizontally periodic surfaces. \n\n\nFor any  and any q \u2208, the surface M_q is horizontally periodic if and only if  W^uu(q) is closed. In this case every surface in W^uu(q) is horizontally periodic, and the horospherical measure on W^uu(q) constructed in Proposition <ref> is finite. \n\n\n\nSuppose first that M_q is horizontally periodic, and let f: S \u2192 M_q be a marking map representing \u2208\u03c0^-1(q). Let C_1, \u2026, C_s be the horizontal cylinders on M_q, and let c_j, h_j denote respectively the circumference and height of C_j. Since the area of M_q is one,\n\n    \u2211_j=1^s  c_j h_j =1.\n\n\nLet \u03b1_1, \u2026, \u03b1_r, \u03b1_r+1, \u2026, \u03b1_s  \u2208 H_1(S, \u03a3) be a generating set satisfying the following:\n\n\n    \n  * The collection {f(\u03b1_i): i =1, \u2026, r+s} consists of saddle connections.\n    \n  * {f(\u03b1_i): i = 1, \u2026, r}, are all the horizontal saddle connections on cylinder boundaries, and are oriented from left to right.\n    \n  * For j = 1, \u2026, s, f(\u03b1_r+j) is contained in C_j, connects one boundary component of C_j to the other, and is oriented from bottom to top. \n\n\nWrite the holonomies (M_, \u03b1_i) as \n\n\n    (M_, \u03b1_i) =     (t_i, 0)    i =1, \u2026, r \n    (M_, \u03b1_j) =     (\u03c4_j, h_j)    j=1, \u2026, s.\n\n  For each j and each boundary component of C_j, we\n  have\n  \n    \u2211_i \u2208\u2110 t_i = c_j,\n\n  where \u2110 is\n  a subset of {1, \u2026, r} containing the saddle connections\n  comprising the boundary component. The numbers t_i, h_j, \u03c4_j\n  also satisfy some linear equations L_1, \u2026, L_t, which\n  describe the space that L is modeled on, in a neighborhood of . \n\nLet ' \u2208^uu(). We first show that the underlying surface\nM_q' is horizontally periodic. There is a continuous path \u03c3\u21a6(\u03c3), \nwith (0) = and (1)=', such that (\u03c3) \u2208^uu() for\nevery \u03c3\u2208 [0,1]. \nBy definition of the horospherical foliation, for any \u03c3\u2208 [0,1],\n((\u03c3)) - () \u2208 H^1(S, \u03a3; _). \nThat is to say, there are t_1(\u03c3), \u2026, t_r(\u03c3), \u03c4_1(\u03c3),\n\u2026, \u03c4_s(\u03c3) \u2208 such \nthat (<ref>) holds for (\u03c3). Note that\nh_j is independent of \u03c3, that the numbers t_i(\u03c3),\nh_j, \u03c4_j(\u03c3) also\nsatisfy the equations L_1, \u2026, L_t, and that the numbers\nc_j(\u03c3) defined by (<ref>) also satisfy\n(<ref>).\n\nAssume first that\n\n    t_i(\u03c3)>0     for all \u03c3\u2208 [0,1]   and \n    i \u2208{1, \u2026, r}.\n\nFor each j \u2208{1, \u2026, s}, the\nset\n\n    {\u03c3\u2208 [0,1] :  the curve  \u03b1_r+j\n      crosses a horizontal cylinder on (\u03c3) }\n\nis open (this is a general property of cylinders, see e.g. <cit.>) and \nclosed (since the heights h_j are fixed). Therefore, by a connectedness\nargument, ' is also made of s horizontal cylinders. By \n(<ref>), these \ncylinders occupy the entire area of (\u03c3), and thus (\u03c3) is\nhorizontally periodic. \n\nNow if (<ref>) fails, let \u03c3_min be the\nsmallest value of \u03c3 for which it fails. When \u03c3 increases to\n\u03c3_min from below, the surfaces (\u03c3) have shorter and shorter\nhorizontal saddle connections on the boundaries of cylinders, and this\nmeans that the surfaces (\u03c3) cannot converge to (\u03c3_min). This shows that (<ref>) holds and\nproves that all surfaces in ^uu() are horizontally periodic. \n                           \n\n\n\n\n  \nAs\nlong as there are numbers c'_i satisfying (<ref>),\nand numbers t'_i>0 satisfying the equations (<ref>) (with\nc_i, t_i replaced by c'_i, t'_i), there is a surface M_' made\nof s cylinders with circumferences c'_j, heights h_j, glued in\nthe same way that they are glued on M_. Clearly we then have '\n\u2208^uu().\n\nFlorent asks whether injectivity of the developing map\n  is implicitly being used here. Also there are more equations coming\n  from  that are missing.\n\n\nThe set of parameters t_i, \u03c4_j giving surfaces in W^uu(q) is bounded. Indeed, the c_i defined by (<ref>) are bounded by (<ref>),  and this implies that the numbers t_i \u2208 (0, max_j c_j) are bounded. Changing the \u03c4_j by adding an integer multiple of c_j amounts to performing Dehn twists in the cylinder C_j and does not change the projection of the surface to . That is, the numbers \u03c4_j  can be taken to lie in the bounded set [0, c_j ). Also, as the parameters t_i leave compact subsets of the bounded domain described above, at least one of the horizontal saddle connections on the corresponding surface has length going to zero. This implies that the bounded set of surfaces we have just described by varying the parameters t_i, \u03c4_j projects to the entire leaf W^uu(q), that this leaf is properly embedded, and that all surfaces in this leaf are horizontally periodic.\n\nFurthermore, we can use (<ref>) to express c_1 as a function of c_2, \u2026, c_s (a constant function when s=1), and using the linear equations defining L, we can write some of the variables c_j, \u03c4_j, t_i as linear combinations of a linearly independent set of variables. We can then write the horospherical measure up to scaling as d\u03bd(q) = \u220f_j=\ud835\udca5_1 dc_j   \u220f_j\u2208\ud835\udca5_2 d\u03c4_j  \u220f_i \u2208\ud835\udca5_3 dt_i, for some subsets of indices, and thus the preceding discussion shows that the total measure of the leaf is bounded.   \n\nNow suppose  that M_q is not horizontally periodic. According to <cit.>, the horocycle orbit Uq consists of surfaces that are not horizontally periodic, but there is q' \u2208Uq such that M_q' is horizontally periodic. By Proposition <ref>, Uq \u2282 W^uu(q), and thus q' \u2208W^uu(q). Since M_q is not horizontally periodic, according to the first part of the proof, q' \u2209 W^uu(q). This shows that the leaf W^uu(q) has an accumulation point that is not contained in the leaf, which is to say that W^uu(q) is not closed. \n\n\n    \n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Classification of horospherical measures in the eigenform loci in\n  (1,1)\n\nThe stratum (1,1) contains a countable collection of complex 3-dimensional invariant\nsubvarieties known as eigenform loci. This terminology is due to\nMcMullen, who gave a complete classification of these invariant\nsubvarieties in a sequence of papers (see <cit.> and references\ntherein), following the first such examples \ndiscovered by Calta <cit.>. The horocycle invariant measures and\norbit-closures for the U-action on an eigenform locus, were\nclassified in <cit.> (these classification results require Theorem\n<ref> of the present work). We can classify the\nhorospherical measures inside eigenform loci as follows: \n\n\n\n\nLet  be an eigenform locus in (1,1), and let \u03bd be an ergodic horospherical measure on . Then either \u03bd is the special flat measure m_ or \u03bd is the measure given by Proposition <ref> on a closed horosphere W^uu(q) of a horizontally periodic surface q \u2208. \n\n\n\nIf \u03bd is saddle connection free then it is the special flat measure\nby Theorem <ref>, and by Proposition <ref>, \u03bd is supported on a properly embedded leaf if and only if \u03bd is supported on horizontally periodic surfaces. The only remaining possibilities are that for a set of positive measure, surfaces have one horizontal saddle connection or a horizontal slit, corresponding to cases (3), (4) or (6) of <cit.>. We assume that such a horospherical measure \u03bd exists, and we will reach a contradiction. By Corollary <ref>, each of the conditions (3), (4), (6) is invariant under the horospherical foliation and so by ergodicity, one of these cases holds for \u03bd-a.e. surface.\n\nLet f: supp \u03bd\u2192_+ be the function that assigns to a\nsurface the length of a horizontal saddle connection (note that in\ncase (3) there is a unique horizontal saddle connection and in cases\n(4) and (6) there are two of equal length).\nLet\n\n    _t  f^-1(t),       _c \u2264 c' f^-1([c,c']),\n\nand let c'> c>0 such that \u03b7\u03bd(_c \u2264 c')>0.\nLet K \u2282(1,1) be the compact set given by Lemma\n<ref>, corresponding to c and to 1/2. \nThe U-action preserves the lengths of horizontal saddle\nconnections, and thus preserves _c \u2264 c'. The U-action also\npreserves \u03bd, by Proposition <ref>. We\nclaim as in the proof of Lemma <ref> that \n\n    \u03bd(K \u2229_c \u2264 c') \u2265\u03b7/2\n\n(and in particular \u03b7 is finite). Indeed, defining \u03bd' \u03bd|__c \u2264 c', we have by the Birkhoff ergodic theorem that\nfor \u03bd'-a.e. x,\n\n    1/T\u222b_0^T 1_K(u_sx)   ds \u27f6_T \u2192\u221e f(x),\n\nwhere f is a function satisfying\n\n    f_L^1(\u03bd')\u22641_K_L^1(\u03bd') = \u03bd(K \u2229_c \u2264 c').\n\nBy Lemma\n<ref> we have f(x) \u22651/2 whenever the limit in\n(<ref>) exists, and this gives (<ref>). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow note that by Proposition <ref>, \n\u03bd is invariant under Rel deformations. In our context there are\nRel deformations which increase the lengths of saddle connections by an\narbitrary  fixed number. This implies that for every s>0,\n\n    \u03bd(_c \u2264 c') = \u03bd(_c+s \u2264 c'+s) .\n\nRepeating the arguments by which we obtained (<ref>)\nwe obtain for every s>0,\n\n    \u03bd(K \u2229_c+s \u2264 c'+s) \u2265\u03b7/2.\n\nFor s >c'-c, and j \u2208,  the sets _c+js \u2264 c'+js are\ndisjoint. This implies that\n\n    \u03bd(K) \u2265\u2211_j=1^\u221e\u03bd(K \u2229_c+js \u2264 c'+j s)  =\n    \u221e,\n\ncontradicing the fact that \u03bd is a Radon measure. \n      \n    \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 A further example in (2)\n\n  Since there is currently no classification of horospherical measures in (2),\n  it is of interest to give examples.\nIn this subsection we construct an ergodic horospherical measure which is not\nthe special flat measure and is not supported on one properly embedded\nhorospherical leaf. Its support is contained  in the four-dimensional\ninvariant subvariety = (2), the genus two\nstratum consisting of surfaces with one singular point of order two. \n\nRecall from Corollary <ref> that for a given\nergodic horospherical measure, almost all surfaces are horizontally\nequivalent. In Figure <ref> we\nshow a typical surface q for our horospherical measure, and a typical\ntopological picture of its horizontal\nsaddle connections. These saddle connections will be denoted by\n\u03b4 and \u03b4'. They disconnect the surface into\na horizontal cylinder C, shaded gray in Figure <ref>,\nand a torus T. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           \nLet x be the length of \u03b4 and \u03b4', let \u03b7 be a saddle\nconnection passing from top to bottom of the cylinder C, and let its\nholonomy be (a, \u03c4). Fix \u2208\u03c0^-1(q). The height of C\nis constant and equal to a in a neighborhood of  in\n^uu(). The area of C is ax, and hence\n\n    0< x < 1/a.\n\nMoreover, changing \u03c4 by an integer multiple of x amounts to\nperforming a Dehn twist in C so does not change the surface\nM_q. Thus we \nmay take \n\n    \u03c4\u2208 [0, x).\n\nWhen varying surfaces within their horospherical leaves, we change\nhorizontal components of all saddle connections, and thus changing\n\u03c4 and x we stay in the horospherical leaf. Similarly, by\nProposition <ref>, u_s'q \u2208 W^uu(q) for\nevery s'.  Moreover, if M_q=C \u222a T as\nabove, the surface u^(T)_s M_q obtained by performing the\nhorocycle flow on T and leaving C unchanged is also in\nW^uu(q). \nIt is easy\nto check that changing the three parameters x,\u03c4, s gives a linear\nmapping in period coordinates, and that the three corresponding\ntangent directions in  directions in T_q() are linearly independent. Since\n()=4, the dimension of the horospherical leaves in  is\nthree, so the variables x, \u03c4, s give an affine parameterization of a neighborhood of\nq in W^uu(q).\n\n\n\nSince the height a of C remains constant in W^uu(q), by (<ref>), (<ref>), the variables x,\u03c4 take values in the\nbounded domain\n\n    \u0394{(x,\u03c4): 0 \u2264\u03c4 < x < 1/a}.\n\nWe construct a bundle \u212c with base \u0394, and a homogeneous space\nfiber, as follows.\nLet  Tor G/_2(\u2124), the space of tori of\nsome fixed area. This area is usually taken to be one, but by\nrescaling, can be taken to be any fixed number. For each x \u2208(0, 1/a), let \nTor(x) denote the space of tori of area 1-ax and with an\nembedded horizontal segment of length x. This is the complement in\nTor of a closed set with empty interior (consisting of\nperiodic horocycles of period at most x). Define \u212c to be \nthe bundle with base \u0394 and such that the fiber \nover (x, \u03c4) \u2208\u0394 is Tor(x).\n\nLet  \n\u03bc be the G-invariant probability measure on\nTor. Since the set of surfaces which do not admit an\nembedded horizontal segment of some length is of \u03bc-measure zero,\nwe can also think of \u03bc as a probability measure \u03bc_x on\nTor(x). \nFor  (x, \u03c4) \u2208\u0394 let C = C(x,\u03c4) be a\ncylinder  of height a, circumference x and\ntwist \u03c4. We have a map \n\n    \u03a8: \u212c\u2192\u210b(2)\n\ndefined by \ngluing the torus T from Tor(x), with a slit of length x, to the\ncylinder C(x, \u03c4). Let\n\n    \u03bd\u222b_0^1/a\u222b_0^x\n    \u03a8_*(\u03bc_x)   d\u03c4  dx.\n\nThe image \u03a8(\u212c) is a five-dimensional properly embedded\nsubmanifold of , consisting of all surfaces that can be presented \nas in Figure <ref> for some fixed choice of a>0. Along\nany sequence of elements  \n(x,\u03c4) \u2208\u0394 leaving compact subsets, we have either x \u2192 0\nor the area 1-ax of T goes to zero, and in both cases the surfaces in\nthe image of \u03a8 have short saddle connections. This shows that\n\u03a8(\u212c) is properly embedded. Since \u03bd is\ninvariant under translations \nusing the affine coordinates x,\u03c4,s, it is a finite\nhorospherical measure supported on \u03a8(\u212c). \n\n\nWe now claim that any measure\n\u03bd which is strong-stable invariant \nand ergodic, with \u039e(\u03bd) of type D, is the above measure up to\nmultiplication by a scalar. \nTo see this, note that the number a = a(M) described\nabove for a surface M \u2208\u210b(2) with \u039e(M) of type D, is\na function on supp \u03bd which is fixed on strong stable leaves,\nso is constant. So we may assume it takes a fixed value a for \u03bd\na.e. surface. Let\n\u2112_a be the subset of \u210b(2) consisting of\nsurfaces with \u039e(M) of type D, and a(M)=a. Then one can show\nusing the above discussion that \u2112_a\nis the image of the set of parameters x, \u03c4, M, where x and\n\u03c4 satisfy (<ref>), (<ref>) and M \u2208Tor(1-ax,x). Moreover this set of parameters embeds\nproperly, i.e. one goes to infinity in \u2112_a \u2282\u210b(2) exactly when x goes to either 0 or 1/a, or M\ngoes to infinity in Tor(1-ax,x). So the functions assigning\nto a surface its parameters x, \u03c4 are well-defined functions, let\n\u2112_a,x,\u03c4 be the level sets of such a function,\ni.e. the subset of \u2112_a with coordinates x, \u03c4 two\nfixed numbers. Then the measure \u03bd decomposes into conditional\nmeasures on each \u2112_a,x,\u03c4 which are invariant under\nthe intersection of the strong stable leaf with this set. As discussed\nabove, each \u2112_a,x,\u03c4 is the pre-image of\n\u03a8_x,\u03c4, i.e. is Tor(1-ax,x), and so \u03bd\ndecomposes into horocycle invariant measures on each\nTor(1-ax,x). By Dani's measure classification <cit.>,\nthis measure is either \u03bd(x,\u03c4) or a measure supported on a\nclosed horocycle. But the surfaces with closed horocycles have\nadditional horizontal saddle connection so, since \u039e(\u03bd) is of\ntype D (not F), we cannot assign positive mass to closed horocycles in\na positive measure's worth of Tor(1-ax,x). So the measure\n\u03bd decomposes into the measures \u03bd(x,\u03c4), and by invariance\nunder the flows in direction x and \u03c4, are equal to the measure \n \u222b_0^1/a\u222b_0^x f(x)\nd\u03bd(x,\u03c4)   d\u03c4  dx up to a constant factor. \n\nTo discuss orbit closures use a similar analysis, using Dani-Smillie\n<cit.> in each Tor(1-ax,x) instead of \n<cit.>. The orbit closure is \u2112_a. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE GEODESIC FLOW AND WEAK UNSTABLE FOLIATION\n\n\nLet \u03bd be a horospherical measure that is invariant by the geodesic\nflow. We will assume that \u03bd is ergodic and is not equal to the\nspecial flat measure, and prove that \u03bd=0. By Theorem <ref>, \u03bd-a.e\nsurface in ^(1) has a horizontal saddle connection. Denote by f the\nmap that maps a surface to the length of its shortest  horizontal\nsaddle connection. Using Lemma <ref> as in the proof of Theorem\n<ref>, we have that for any c>0, \n\n    \u03bd(_\u2265 c) <\u221e,     where _\u2265 c f^-1([c,\u221e)).\n\nSince \u03bd( \u22c2_c' \u2265 c_\u2265 c')= 0, this implies\n\n    \u03bd(_\u2265 c')  \u27f6_c' \u2192\u221e 0.\n \nThe geodesic flow expands the horizontal direction, and hence \n\n    g_t (_\u2265 c)= _\u2265 ce^t.\n\nBy invariance of the measure \u03bd under the A-action, we obtain\nthat \u03bd(_\u2265 c ) = \u03bd(_\u2265 ce^t )\n\u2192 0, and hence \u03bd(_\u2265 c)=0 for any c>0. This implies \u03bd\n=0.\n\n\nWe now show that any leaf for the weak-unstable foliation is dense. Let q \u2208_1^(1), let U be an open set contained in ^(1) and let f be a nonzero non negative compactly supported function whose support is contained in U. In order to show U \u2229 W^u(q) \u2260\u2205 we will show that there is p \u2208 W^u(q) such that f(p)>0. Let \u03b5\u222b_ f  d \u03bc_>0, let \u03c9_f denote the continuity modulus of f with respect to the sup-norm distance function, and let \u2208\u03c0^-1(q). Using Propositions <ref> and <ref>, let  be a regular box containing  such that for any t \u2265 0, the box _t  g_t() satisfies \u03c9_f(\u03c4__t) + 2f _\u221e\u03b4__t < \u03b5/4. Let m_ be the special flat measure on ^(1). By mixing of the geodesic flow (Proposition <ref>), there is T>0 such that for any t>T, we have  \n\n\n    | 1/m_()\u222b__t f   dm_ - \u222b_f   dm_| < \u03b5/4.\n\n\nApplying Proposition\n<ref> to the special flat measure m_, and denoting by _t the plaque of g_t in _t, we have \n\n\n    |1/m_()\u222b__t f   dm_ - 1/(_t)\u222b__t f \u2218\u03c0 d| < \u03b5/4,\n\n\nand consequently\n\n    |\u222b_ f   dm_ - 1/(_t)\u222b__t f \u2218\u03c0 d | < \u03b5/2.\n\n\nThis implies \u222b__t f \u2218\u03c0 d > 0 and since \u03c0(_t) is\ncontained in W^u(q), we obtain that there is p \u2208 W^u(q) such that f(p) >0. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CLOSURES OF HOROSPHERICAL LEAVES\n\nThe goal of this section is to prove Theorem <ref>. First, in order to explain the idea, we will prove\nthe following weaker result.\n\n\n\n\nLet q \u2208^(1) be a surface without horizontal saddle connections. Then W^uu(q) is dense in ^(1).  \n\n\n\nLet U be any open set contained in ^(1) and let f be a nonzero non-negative function whose support is contained in  U.  It is enough to show that there is p \u2208 W^uu_q such that f(p)>0. Let \u03b5\u222b_ f   dm_ >0, let c  1,  and let K be a compact subset as in Lemma <ref>. For any n>0, the surface g_-nq does not have horizontal saddle connections and thus there is s_n >0 such that p_n  u_s_n g_-n  q satisfies \n\n\n    p_n \u2208 K \u2229 W^uu(g_-n q).\n\n \nThe horocycle flow preserves the horospheres and the geodesic flow permutes them. As a consequence g_n p_n \u2208 W^uu(q). Since K \u2229_1^(1) can be covered by the image by \u03c0 of finitely many arbitrarily small boxes, by passing to a subsequence and using Propositions <ref> and <ref>, we can assume that there is a box \u2282\u03c0^-1() such that the translates _n = g_n() satisfy \u03c9_f(\u03c4__n) + 2f_\u221e\u03b4__n < \u03b5/4  and p_n \u2208\u03c0(), for all n \u2208\u2115. Denote by _n a plaque of _n = g_n() whose image by \u03c0 contains g_n(p_n). By mixing of the geodesic flow, for all large enough n:\n\n\n    | 1/m_()\u222b__n f   dm_ - \u222b_f   dm_| < \u03b5/4.\n\n\nIt thus follows from Proposition <ref> applied to the special flat measure m_ that\n\n\n    |1/m_(B)\u222b_B_n f   dm_ - 1/(_n)\u222b__n f \u2218\u03c0| < \u03b5/4 .\n\n\nConsequently, for large enough n, \n\n    |\u222b_ f   dm_ - 1/(_n)\u222b__n f \u2218\u03c0| < \u03b5/2,\n\n\nand thus\n\n\n    1/(_n)\u222b__n f \u2218\u03c0 > \u222b_ f   dm_ - \u03b5/2 > 0.\n \n \nThis implies that there is a p \u2208\u03c0(_n) \u2282 W^uu(q) such that f(p) >0. \n\n\n\n\n\n  In order to upgrade Theorem <ref> to Theorem <ref>, we will need the following result:\n  \nLet   be an invariant subvariety and suppose that q \u2208^(1)\nhas horizontal saddle connections, but is not horizontally\nperiodic. Then there is q' \u2208 W^uu(q) \nsuch that all horizontal saddle connections on M_q' are longer than\nthe shortest horizontal saddle connection on M_q. If in addition\nM_q has no horizontal cylinders, then for any T>0  there is q' \u2208 W^uu(q)\nsuch that the shortest horizontal saddle connection on M_q' is\nlonger than T.  \n    \n\n\n\n\nWe repeat the arguments given in the proof of Theorem <ref>. In that proof, the only place where we used the assumption that q has no horizontal saddle connections, is to ensure the existence of p_n satisfying (<ref>). For this, using Proposition <ref> and Lemma <ref>, it is enough to show that  there is q_n' \u2208 W^uu(g_-nq) such that the shortest horizontal saddle connection in M_q'_n has length at least one. By our assumption, M_q has no horizontal cylinders and therefore neither does M_g_-nq, and thus we can conclude using the second assertion of Theorem <ref>.  \n\n\n \nLet q \u2208_1^(1) be a surface with horizontal cylinders C_1, \u2026, C_s. Its leaf-closure W^uu(q) can be described as a properly embedded bundle \u212c in ^(1), very similar to the one discussed in <ref>. We sketch the argument here. Any surface in q' \u2208 W^uu(q) also has corresponding cylinders  C'_1, \u2026, C'_s (see the proof of Proposition <ref>). Let c'_j, a'_j, \u03c4'_j denote respectively their circumferences, heights, and twists. We have a'_j = a_j, that is the heights of the cylinders are the same on the surfaces M_q and M_q'. Arguing as in the proof of Proposition <ref>, the numbers c'_j, \u03c4'_j belong to a bounded subset \u0394\u2282^2s. Let \u0394_q be the subset of \u0394 describing cylinders that can arise for q' \u2208 W^uu(q). This set is the base of \u212c. The fiber over c\u20d7, \u03c4\u20d7\u2208\u0394_q is described as follows.  Let q' \u2208 W^uu(q) have cylinders C'_1, \u2026, C'_s whose geometry is prescribed by c\u20d7, \u03c4\u20d7, and  let q\u201d be the surface obtained by removing the cylinders C'_1, \u2026, C'_s and regluing the boundary components to each other by a translation. The translation in each cylinder is chosen so that singularities on opposite sides of a cylinder are not glued to each other. This surface can be alternatively described as the limit t \u2192 0 of the cylinder stretch map g\u0305, for g=(  t     s \n 0     1), for some s  (see Proposition <ref>). The surface q\u201d belongs to some invariant subvariety \u201d, independent of c\u20d7, \u03c4\u20d7, in a lower dimensional stratum. It has no horizontal cylinders, so by Theorem <ref>, its horosphere is dense in \u201d. Note that the area of q\u201d is not one and so we apply Theorem <ref> after rescaling. Thus the fibers of \u212c are all isomorphic to \u201d. As c\u20d7, \u03c4\u20d7 leaves compact subsets of \u0394_q, the corresponding surfaces have shorter and shorter horizontal saddle connections, and thus \u212c is properly embedded in .\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\u00a7 EXTENDING SADDLE CONNECTIONS AND CYLINDERS (APISA AND WRIGHT)\n       \nIn this section we give the proof of Theorem <ref>. We need some auxiliary statements. A horizontal cylinder on a translation surface is a cylinder whose core curve is horizontal. We say that a cylinder and a saddle connection are disjoint if they do not intersect, except perhaps at singular points. Our convention is that cylinders are closed, and thus a cylinder and a saddle connection on one of its boundary components are not considered to be disjoint. \n\n\nWe recall the notion of -equivalence of cylinders, introduced in <cit.>.  Let  be an invariant subvariety, let q \u2208 and let C_1, C_2 be two parallel cylinders in M_q. The cylinders are called -parallel if there is a neighborhood \ud835\udcb0 of q in , such that C_1, C_2 remain parallel for all q' \u2208\ud835\udcb0. More precisely: \n\n\n    \n  * there is a lift L of  and open \ud835\udcb1\u2282 L and \ud835\udcb0\u2282 such that q \u2208\ud835\udcb0, \u03c0|_\ud835\udcb1: \ud835\udcb1\u2192\ud835\udcb0 is a homeomorphism and  is injective on \ud835\udcb1;\n    \n  * for \u2208\ud835\udcb1 with q = \u03c0(), represented by a marking map f: S \u2192 M_q, and for any ' \u2208\ud835\udcb1, represented by f': S \u2192 M_q', the sets f' \u2218 f^-1(C_i),  i=1,2 are parallel cylinders on q' = \u03c0('). \n \nBeing -parallel is clearly an equivalence relation.\n\nFor a cylinder C on a translation surface M, we denote by G_C the subgroup of  fixing the holonomy of the core curve of  C. Clearly G_C_1 = G_C_2 if C_1, C_2 are parallel. If C_1, \u2026, C_r are parallel on M and g \u2208 G_C_1 then the cylinder surgery corresponding to g, C_1, \u2026, C_r consists of applying g to the C_i and leaving the complement M \u22c3_i=1^r C_i untouched. \nFor example if C is horizontal then the elements of G_C are of the form ( 1     s \n 0     t), with t>0. The cylinder surgery of such a matrix with t=1 consists of cylinder shears (with shear parameter s), and with s=0, consists of cylinder stretches (with stretch parameter t). By an appropriate conjugation, the definition of cylinder shears and stretches is extended to non-horizontal cylinders. \n\n\nWe have: \n\nFor , any q \u2208, and an -parallel equivalence class of cylinders C_1, \u2026, C_r on M_q, if g \u2208 G_C_i then the surface  obtained from M_q by cylinder surgery corresponding to g, C_1, \u2026, C_r is also in . \n\n\n\n\n \nSuppose q \u2208 and C_1, \u2026, C_r are -parallel cylinders on q, which are not necessarily a full equivalence class of -parallel cylinders. \nLet L be a lift of , let \u2208 L \u2229\u03c0^-1(q) and let V \u2282 H^1 ( S, \u03a3; ) such that (L)=V.  \nVarying g \u2208 G_C_1 gives rise to a two dimensional collection (in the previous example, corresponding to possible choices of the parameters s,t) of surfaces, obtained from M_q\n by cylinder surgery corresponding to g, C_1, \u2026, C_r. This collection is affine in period coordinates and its tangent direction is a one dimensional complex subspace of H^1 (S, \u03a3; ). A generator for this subspace is \n    \u03c3_{C_i, h_i}\u2211_i=1^r h_i \u03b3_i^*,\n\n where h_i is the height of C_i, \u03b3_i is the core curve of C_i (considered as an element of H_1(S, \u03a3)) and \u03b3_i^* is the dual class in H^1(S, \u03a3). Moving along the line tangent to \u03c3_{C_i, h_i} in  amounts to performing cylinder shears in each of the C_i, and moving along the line tangent to \ud835\udc22\u00b7\u03c3_{C_i, h_i} in  amounts to performing cylinder stretches. \n \n Below we will be interested in such one-parameter families of deformations, tangent to \u03c3_{C_i, h_i} as in (<ref>), in which the C_i might not be a full equivalence class of -parallel cylinders, and the h_i might not be their heights. Note that for cylinder shears, such surgeries are well-defined for any value of the shear parameter s, and for cylinder stretches, they are well-defined as long as t>0. \n \n \n When \u03c3_{C_i, h_i}\u2208 V for , L, V as above we simply say that \u03c3_{C_i, h_i} is contained in the tangent space to  at q.\n \n\n\n\n \n  \nIf  is an invariant subvariety and q \u2208 is not horizontally periodic, then there is a nonempty collection of -parallel cylinders C_1, \u2026, C_r on M_q which consists of cylinders disjoint from all horizontal saddle connections on M_q,\nand positive h_1, \u2026, h_r such that the class \u03c3_{C_i, h_i} as in (<ref>) is contained in the tangent space to  at q.\nFurthermore, there is A_0>0, depending only on , so that if q \u2208 has no horizontal cylinders, one can choose a collection of cylinders with these properties, so that in addition, the sum of the areas of the cylinders is at least A_0. \n\n\nWe note that the h_i in Proposition <ref> might not be the heights of the C_i. The vector \u03c3_{C_i, h_i} is tangent to the line in  obtained by applying different cylinders shears to each C_i. In order to formalize this, \n for g_i \u2208 C_i for each i, we define the cylinder surgery corresponding to {C_i, g_i} to be the map obtained by applying g_i to each C_i, leaving the complement M \u22c3_i=1^r C_i untouched. With this terminology, \nthe line tangent to \u03c3_{C_i, h_i} is the collection of surfaces obtained by cylinder surgery corresponding to {C_i, g_i}, where s \u2208 and  g_i performs a cylinder shear with parameter sh_i in C_i. Similarly, the line tangent to \ud835\udc22\u00b7\u03c3_{C_i, h_i} is the collection of surfaces obtained by cylinder surgery corresponding to {C_i, g_i}, where s \u2208 and  g_i performs a cylinder stretch with parameter sh_i in C_i.\n\nSince the U-action is linear in charts,  preserves horizontal saddle connections, and maps -equivalent cylinders to -equivalent cylinders, preserving their area, the validity of both statements is unchanged if we replace q with some surface q'  in its horocycle orbit Uq. According to\n<cit.>, there is q_\u221e in the closure of Uq which is horizontally periodic, and we will see that the required properties hold for all q' sufficiently close to q_\u221e. Let M_\u221e be the underlying surface of q_\u221e, let C_1, \u2026, C_r be the horizontal cylinders on M_\u221e, and for each i, A_i, c_i, h_i, \u03b3_i denote respectively the area, circumference, height, and core curve of C_i. Here we consider \u03b3_i as an element of H_1(S, \u03a3) by using a marking f: S \u2192 M_\u221e corresponding to _\u221e\u2208\u03c0^-1(q_\u221e). By Proposition <ref>, \u03c3_{C_i, h_i} belongs to the tangent space of  at q.\n\nFor any \u03b8_0>0 there is a neighborhood \ud835\udcb0 = \ud835\udcb0(\u03b8_0) of q_\u221e in  such that  if q' \u2208\ud835\udcb0 then the underlying surface has r cylinders C'_1, \u2026, C'_r of circumferences and areas satisfying\n\n\n    c'_i < c\u0305\n    2max_i=1, \u2026, r c_i,     A'_i\n    > A1/2min_i=1, \u2026, r A_i ,\n\nand with directions of core curves in (-\u03b8_0, \u03b8_0).\n\nIf C and \u03c3 are a cylinder and a straight segment on a translation surface, we say that \u03c3 crosses C if it intersects both of the boundary components of C (possibly at singular points). Since a cylinder contains no singularities in its interior, if a saddle connection intersects the interior of a cylinder, then it must cross it. Let s  be the maximal length of a horizontal saddle connection on M_q and let \u03b8_0 be small enough so that a horizontal segment of length s cannot cross a cylinder of direction \u03b8 satisfying 0 < |\u03b8| < \u03b8_0, with circumference at most c\u0305 and area at least A. \n\nBy making \ud835\udcb0 smaller, so that it is an evenly covered neighborhood of q_\u221e, we can ensure that \n\u03c3_{C'_i, h_i} belongs to the tangent space of  at q'. Indeed, if \ud835\udcb1 is a connected component of \u03c0^-1(\ud835\udcb0) and ', _\u221e\u2208\ud835\udcb1 are preimages of q', q_\u221e respectively, then the core curves of the cylinders C'_i, C_i map to the same elements \u03b3_i \u2208 H_1(S, \u03a3) under the corresponding marking maps, and thus \u03c3_{C'_i, h_i} = \u03c3_{C_i, h_i}. \n\n\n\n\n\nNow suppose that q' \u2208 Uq \u2229\ud835\udcb0, and let M' be the underlying surface. Since q is not horizontally periodic, neither is q'. Therefore there is an equivalence class C_1, \u2026, C_r of -parallel cylinders on M_\u221e, so that the corresponding cylinders C'_1, \u2026, C'_r are not horizontal cylinders on M', and satisfy the bounds (<ref>). Furthermore the maximal length of a horizontal saddle connection on M' is s, since the horocycle flow maps horizontal saddle connections to horizontal saddle connections of the same length. By choice of \u03b8_0, the cylinders in this equivalence class are all disjoint from horizontal saddle connections on M'. This proves the first assertion.  \n\nLet t be an upper bound on the number of horizontal cylinders for a surface in  and let A_0 1/2t. The argument above works for any collection of -parallel cylinders C_1, \u2026, C_r which are horizontal on q_\u221e and are not horizontal on q'. If q has no horizontal cylinders then neither does q', and we can apply the argument with any equivalence class of -parallel horizontal cylinders C_1, \u2026, C_r on M_\u221e. One of these classes must have total area at least 1/t, and thus for \ud835\udcb0 sufficiently small, the sums of the areas of the corresponding cylinders C'_1, \u2026, C'_r is at least A_0. \n\n\n \n We first prove the first assertion. Let C_1, \u2026, C_r be the -parallel cylinders on M_q, and h_1, \u2026, h_r the positive numbers provided by Proposition <ref>. \nWe define q' as g \u2218\u03c6 (q), where g \u2208 and \u03c6 is a cylinder surgery corresponding to {C_i, g_i}, and g_i is the cylinder stretch with parameter sh_i for some s<0. \nNeither of the maps g, \u03c6 preserves the area of the surface, we will choose parameters so that their composition does. Moreover both of these maps will not change the vertical component of the holonomy of any curve. \nThe -action preserves , and by Proposition <ref>, so does \u03c6. The map g will increase the length of all horizontal saddle connections on q, and the cylinder surgery \u03c6 will not affect their length, since the cylinders C_i are disjoint from the horizontal saddle connections on q. \n\n\n\nThe area of \u03c6 (q) is smaller than the area of q since all of the cylinders C_i are stretched by a negative parameter. Let A  be the sum of the areas of the cylinders C_1, \u2026, C_r. Then by choosing the parameter s appropriately, we can arrange so that the area of \u03c6(q) is 1-A/2. We now set \n\n    t (1 -A/2)^-1    and  g (  t     0 \n     0     1 ).\n\n\nThen g increases the lengths of horizontal saddle connections by a factor t>1, and multiplies the area of \u03c6(q) by t. This completes the proof of the first assertion.\n\nFor the second assertion, we use the second assertion in Proposition <ref> to choose the cylinders so the sum of their areas satisfies A \u2265 A_0. This ensures that the horizontal saddle connections on q'  g \u2218\u03c6 (q) are longer than the horizontal saddle connections on q by a factor of at least t, where t>1 is as in (<ref>) and t-1 is bounded away from 0. In light of Proposition <ref>,  q' \u2208 W^uu(q) also does not have horizontal cylinders. So we can apply the above argument iteratively, at each stage obtaining surfaces in W^uu(q) with longer and longer horizontal saddle connections. Since the lengths of these horizontal  saddle connections grows by a definite amount in each step, after finitely many steps they will all be longer than T. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MEASURES ON  AND (S,\u03a3)-INVARIANT MEASURES ON \n\nThe goal of this section is to prove a result on the correspondence between Radon measures on  and (S,\u03a3)-invariant Radon measures on . This result is part of the folklore but we were not able to find a reference; see <cit.> for an analogous result in a restricted setting. \n\nWe state the result in a general setting.\nLet X\u0303 be a paracompact manifold and \u0393 a discrete group acting properly discontinuously on X\u0303. We will write the \u0393-action as an action on the right.  \nLet X=X\u0303/\u0393 be the quotient space and \u03c0:X\u0303\u2192 X the quotient map. \nIf \u0393 acts freely then X is a manifold and \u03c0 is a covering map. If \u0393 does not act freely then we can view X as an orbifold and \u03c0 as a regular orbifold covering map (although no knowledge of orbifolds is assumed in this section). \nWe do not assume that the action on \u0393 is faithful but, since the action of \u0393 is proper, the subgroup of \u0393 that acts trivially on X\u0303 must be finite.\n\n\n\n\nFor q\u0303\u2208X\u0303 let \u0393(q\u0303) be the stabilizer of q\u0303 in \u0393.\nFor any q \u2208 X, we define a measure on X\u0303 by\n\n    \u03b8_q \u2211_q\u0303\u2208\u03c0^-1( q) |\u0393(q\u0303)|\u00b7\u03b4_q\u0303,\n\nwhere \u03b4_q\u0303 is the Dirac mass at q\u0303. The measure \u03b8_q is supported on \u03c0^-1(q).  For any f \u2208 C_c(X\u0303) and q\u0303\u2208X\u0303 we have\n\n    \u222b_X\u0303 f   d\u03b8_\u03c0(q\u0303) = \u2211_\u03b3\u2208\u0393f(q\u0303\u00b7\u03b3).\n\n It follows from the fact that \u0393 acts properly discontinuously on X\u0303 that the sum on the right-hand side is finite.\n\n\nGiven a Radon measure \u03bd on X we define a Radon measure \u03bd\u0303 on X\u0303, called the pre-image of \u03bd, by the formula \n\n    \u222b_X\u0303 f  d\u03bd\u0303 = \u222b_X(\u222b_X\u0303 f  d\u03b8_q )  d\u03bd(q)    for any  f \u2208 C_c(X\u0303).\n\n\nEquation\u00a0(<ref>) defines a unique Radon measure \u03bd\u0303 on X\u0303 in light of the Riesz Representation Theorem. To see that (<ref>) converges, note that the integrand q \u21a6 F(q) \n\u222b_X\u0303 f  d\u03b8_q is a Borel function, which is supported on the compact set \u03c0( supp  f), and is bounded by D   f _\u221e, where D #{\u03b3\u2208\u0393: (supp  f) \u00b7\u03b3\u2229supp  f \u2260\u2205} is finite since the \u0393-action is properly discontinuous.  \n\nBy (<ref>) the measures \u03b8_q are all \u0393-invariant, and since \u03bd\u0303 is an average of the measures \u03b8_q, we have: \n\n\nThe measure \u03bd\u0303 is  \u0393-invariant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following converse can be understood as a disintegration theorem for \u0393-invariant Radon measures on X\u0303.\n\n\n    Let m be a \u0393-invariant Radon measure on X\u0303. There is a unique Radon measure \u03bc on X such that m is the pre-image of \u03bc.\n\n\nWe call \u03bc the image of m.\n\n\nLet m be given. We are claiming the existence of a Radon measure \u03bc so that \n(<ref>) holds (with \u03bd\u0303, \u03bd replaced with m, \u03bc). \n\n\n\n\nThe idea of the proof is to build \u03bc on small neighborhoods using the fact that \u03c0 is an orbifold cover. This will be made rigorous using a partition of unity. Let q\u0303\u2208X\u0303 and let \u0393(q\u0303) be the stabilizer of q\u0303 in \u0393. Since \u0393 acts properly discontinuously on X\u0303,  \u0393(q\u0303) is finite, and there is connected \u0393(q\u0303)-invariant neighborhood  of q\u0303 and a neighborhood  of \u03c0(q\u0303) such that \u03c0 induces a homeomorphism / \u0393(q\u0303) \u2192, and \n    \n    \u03c0^-1() =  _\u03b3\u2208\u0393(q\u0303) \\\u0393\u00b7\u03b3,\n\nwhere \u03b3 ranges over a set of coset representatives, and where the sets \ud835\udcb1\u00b7\u03b3 are  disjoint.\n We say that such a \u2282 X is evenly covered (in the orbifold sense). \n \n Let (_i)_i \u2208 I be a locally finite cover of X by evenly covered neighborhoods. \n Such a cover exists by the paracompactness of X\u0303 and the considerations above. \n For each i \u2208 I choose a connected component _i of \u03c0^-1(_i). Denote by \u0393_i=\u0393(_i) the stabilizer of _i in \u0393. \n Let (\u03c1_i)_i\u2208 I be a partition of unity subordinate to the cover (_i)_i \u2208 I and define a Radon measure \u03bc on X (by using the Riesz Representation Theorem) such that for any f \u2208 C_c(X),\n    \n    \u222b_X f  d\u03bc = \u2211_i \u2208 I1/|\u0393_i|\u222b__i (\u03c1_i f) \u2218\u03c0  dm.\n\n\n\n    We want to show that the measure \u03bc satisfies (<ref>). \n    We claim first that for any q\u0303\u2208X\u0303, there is a neighborhood  around q\u0303 such that (<ref>) holds for any f \u2208 C_c(X\u0303) with support contained in . \n    Indeed, let q\u0303\u2208X\u0303 and let  be a neighborhood of q\u0303 small enough so that for any i \u2208 I,  intersects at most one connected component of \u03c0^-1(_i). \n    This is possible since the cover by the _i is locally finite. Let J = {i \u2208 I : \u03c0() \u2229_i \u2260\u2205} and for j \u2208 J, let \u03b3_j \u2208\u0393 be such that _j \u00b7\u03b3_j \u2229\u2260\u2205. \n    By the assumption on \ud835\udcb1, the coset  \u0393_j \u00b7\u03b3_j is uniquely determined. \n    Let f \u2208 C_c(X\u0303) with support contained in . We compute:\n \n    \u222b_X( \u222b_X\u0303 f  d\u03b8_q )  d\u03bc(q) \n               = \u2211_i \u2208 I1/|\u0393_i|\u222b__i\u2211_\u03b3\u2208\u0393\u03c1_i(\u03c0(q\u0303) )f(q\u0303\u00b7\u03b3)  dm(q\u0303) \n       = \u2211_j \u2208 J1/|\u0393_j|\u222b__j \u00b7\u03b3_j\u2211_\u03b3\u2208\u0393_j\u03c1_j(\u03c0(q\u0303)) f(q\u0303\u00b7\u03b3)  dm(q\u0303) \n       = \u2211_j \u2208 J1/|\u0393_j|\u222b_X\u0303\u2211_\u03b3\u2208\u0393_j\u03c1_j(\u03c0(q\u0303)) f(q\u0303)  dm(q\u0303) \n       = \u2211_j \u2208 J\u222b_X\u0303\u03c1_j(\u03c0(q\u0303)) f(q\u0303)  dm(q\u0303) = \u222b_X\u0303 f   dm.\n\n    \n    Now let  f be an arbitrary compactly supported continuous function and let K denote its support. \n    Using a covering argument and the computation above, we can find finitely many (_i)_i that cover K and such that (<ref>) holds for continuous functions with support contained in _i. Let (\u03c8_i)_i be a partition of unity associated with this cover.\n    We can write f = \u2211_i \u03c8_if. By construction, each of the \u03c8_if has support contained in _i and the result follows by (<ref>) and the linearity of the integral.  \n    \n    To prove uniqueness of the measure \u03bc, we proceed as follows. Let \u03bc_1 and \u03bc_2 be two Radon measures on X that satisfy (<ref>) (with m,\u03bc_i instead of \u03bd\u0303, \u03bd).\n    \n    Let f \u2208 C_c(X) be a compactly supported continuous function whose support is contained in an evenly covered neighborhood  and let  be a connected component of \u03c0^-1(). \n    We denote by \u0393() the stabilizer in \u0393 of . Let h be the function on X\u0303 that is equal to  f \u2218\u03c0 on  and vanishes outside of . \n    Since the support of f is contained in , the function h is continuous and has compact support. Furthermore, it is easy to see that for any q \u2208 X, \u222b_X\u0303 h  d\u03b8_q = |\u0393()| f(q). This implies\n    \n    \u222b_X f  d\u03bc_1 = 1/|\u0393()|\u222b_X\u0303 h  dm =\u222b_X f  d\u03bc_2.\n\n    To deal with the case when f is an arbitrary function of compact support we appeal once more to existence of partitions of unity. \n\n\n\n\nLet G be a group acting on X\u0303 so that the action commutes with the action of \u0393.\nThe group G induces an action on X so that \u03c0 is G-equivariant.\n\n\n A Radon measure \u03bc on X is invariant under g\u2208 G if and only if its pre-image \u03bc\u0303 is invariant under the action of g on X\u0303.\n\n\n \nWe start by proving two formulas showing the naturality of the pre-image construction.\n\ng_*(\u03b8_q)=\u03b8_g(q).\n\n\n\n    g_*(\u03b8_q)   \n     \n     =\u2211_\u03c0(q\u0303)=q|\u0393(q\u0303)|\u00b7\u03b4_g(q\u0303)\n        =\u2211_\u03c0(g(q\u0303))=g(q)|\u0393(q\u0303)|\u00b7\u03b4_g(q\u0303)\n       =\u2211_\u03c0(g(q\u0303))=g(q)|\u0393(g(q\u0303))|\u00b7\u03b4_g(q\u0303)=\u03b8_g(q).\n\nIn line\u00a0(<ref>) we used the fact that \u03c0(g(q\u0303))=g(\u03c0(q\u0303))=g(q). In line\u00a0(<ref>) we used the fact\n\nthat the \u0393 action commutes with g, which implies that |\u0393(g(q\u0303))|=|\u0393(q\u0303)|.\n\n\ng_*(\u03bc\u0303)=g_*(\u03bc).\n\n\nIt suffices to show that both measures assign the same integrals to continuous functions of compact support on X\u0303. Let f be such a function.\n\n    \u222b_X\u0303f  dg_*(\u03bd)    =\u222b_X(\u222b_X\u0303 f  d\u03b8_q )  dg_*(\u03bd)(q)\n        =\u222b_X(\u222b_X\u0303 f  d\u03b8_g(q)) d\u03bd(q) =\u222b_X(\u222b_X\u0303 f  dg_*(\u03b8_q) ) d\u03bd(q) \n        =\u222b_X(\u222b_X\u0303 f\u2218 g   d\u03b8_q ) d\u03bd(q) \n        =\u222b_X\u0303f\u2218 g  d\u03bd\u0303=\u222b_X\u0303f  dg_*(\u03bd\u0303).\n\nIn line\u00a0(<ref>) we used Claim <ref>. In line\u00a0(<ref>) we used the definition of the pre-image applied to the function of compact support f\u2218 g.\n\nUsing these formulas we now prove the Proposition.\nIf g_*(\u03bc)=\u03bc then g_*(\u03bc\u0303)=g_*(\u03bc)=\u03bc\u0303 by Claim <ref>. So \u03bc\u0303  is invariant under the action of g on X\u0303.\nIf g_*(\u03bc\u0303)=\u03bc\u0303 then g_*(\u03bc)=g_*(\u03bc\u0303)=\u03bc\u0303 so the pre-images of g_*(\u03bc) and \u03bc are equal. \nIt follows from the uniqueness assertion in Proposition <ref> that g_*(\u03bc)=\u03bc.\n\n\nalpha\n\n\n"}
