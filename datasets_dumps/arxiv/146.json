Quantum maximal correlation is a measure of correlation with the monotonicity and tensorization properties that can be used to study whether an arbitrary number of copies of a resource state can be locally transformed into a target state without classical communication, known as the local state transformation problem. We show that the required optimization for computing the quantum maximal correlation of Gaussian states can be restricted to local operators that are linear in terms of phase-space quadrature operators. This allows us to derive a closed-form expression for the quantum maximal correlation in terms of the covariance matrix of Gaussian states. Moreover, we define Gaussian maximal correlation based on considering the class of local hermitian operators that are linear in terms of phase-space quadrature operators associated with local homodyne measurements. This measure satisfies the tensorization property and can be used for the Gaussian version of the local state transformation problem when both resource and target states are Gaussian. We also generalize these measures to the multipartite case.

This problem has been extensively studied under the class of local operations and classical communication in the context of entanglement distillation, where two parties aim to prepare a highly-entangled state using copies of a weakly entangled state\u00a0<cit.>. The optimal rate of entanglement distillation for pure states equals the entanglement entropy\u00a0<cit.>, and there are mixed entangled states that are not distillable\u00a0<cit.>. \n\nA more recent version of this problem is local state transformation under local operations and without classical communication\u00a0<cit.>. See Figure\u00a0<ref> for a precise description of the problem. This problem is highly non-trivial even if the goal is to generate only a single copy of the target state \u03c3_A'B' \nusing arbitrarily many copies of the resource state \u03c1_AB. The difficulty remains even if the target state is not entangled, or even in the fully classical setting\u00a0<cit.>; see also\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\nTo study the local state transformation problem we need measures of correlation that are monotone under local operations and remain unchanged when computed on multiple copies of a bipartite state. The latter crucial property is called tensorization, and is required since in local state transformation we assume the availability of arbitrary many copies of the resource state while we aim to generate only a single copy of the target. There are resource measures, based on certain free operations, for Gaussian states\u00a0<cit.>, quantum coherence\u00a0<cit.>, and  nonclassicality of quantum states\u00a0<cit.> that satisfy the tensorization property. However, this property is not satisfied by most measures of correlation, such as mutual information and entanglement measures, which makes them inapplicable to the local state transformation problem. Quantum maximal correlation was introduced as a measure that satisfies both the monotonicity and the tensorization properties, and therefore is suitable for proving bounds on this problem\u00a0<cit.>. In particular, based on these properties, one can see that local state transformation is not possible if the maximal correlation of the target state is larger than that of the resource state; see Section\u00a0<ref> for more details.\n\t\nQuantum maximal correlation of a bipartite quantum state \u03c1_AB is defined as sup |(\u03c1_AB X_A^\u2020\u2297 Y_B)|, where the supremum is taken over all local operators X_A, Y_B that satisfy (\u03c1_A X_A) = \u03c1(\u03c1_BY_B) =0 and (\u03c1_A X_A^\u2020 X_A) = \u03c1(\u03c1_BY_B^\u2020 Y_B) =1. It is shown that computing quantum maximal correlation is a tractable problem for systems with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space\u00a0<cit.>. However, in general, it is not clear how to calculate quantum maximal correlation for states of continuous-variable systems with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, as the space of local operators X_A, Y_B becomes intractable. Of particular interest is the class of Gaussian states that are readily available in the laboratory and can be used as resource states to prepare other states.   \n\n\nIn this paper, we compute the quantum maximal correlation for Gaussian states of continuous-variable systems. This measure enables us to study the local state transform problem when either the resource state or the target state is Gaussian. In this case, we show that for Gaussian states it is sufficient to optimize over local operators X_A, Y_B that are linear in terms of phase-space quadrature operators. This turns the inherently infinite-dimensional problem of computing quantum maximal correlation into a finite dimensional one; see Theorem\u00a0<ref> for the statement of our main result. Moreover, we define Gaussian maximal correlation, as a measure based on hermitian and linear local operators in terms of quadrature operators, corresponding to local homodyne measurements. This measure can be used in the Gaussian local state transform scenarios, where the target and resource states are Gaussian. In particular, this shows that copies of weakly-correlated Gaussian states cannot be locally transformed to a highly-correlated Gaussian state. This result should be compared to previous results showing that entanglement in Gaussian states cannot be distilled using Gaussian operations\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nWe also generalize the quantum maximal correlation to the multipartite setting. We define an invariant of multipartite quantum states called quantum maximal correlation ribbon that, similar to the bipartite case, satisfies the monotonicity and the tensorization properties. We also show that to compute the maximal correlation ribbon for multipartite Gaussian states it suffices to restrict to local operators that are linear in terms of quadrature operators. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\nStructure of the paper:  In Section\u00a0<ref>, we review the notion of quantum maximal correlation from\u00a0<cit.>. In Section\u00a0<ref>, we review the definition of Gaussian states and some of their main properties. We note that the objective function in quantum maximal correlation is a bilinear form which can be thought of as an inner product. Then, to compute maximal correlation it would be useful to find orthonormal bases for the space of local operators X_A, Y_B. Following this point of view, Section\u00a0<ref> is devoted to introduce such an orthonormal basis for Gaussian states which might be of independent interest. Results of this section will be used to prove our main result in Section\u00a0<ref>. We introduce the Gaussian maximal correlation in Section\u00a0<ref>. Considering examples of Gaussian states in Section\u00a0<ref>, we further illustrate various features of these correlation measures. We also generalize the definition of maximal correlation for multipartite states in Section\u00a0<ref> by introducing the quantum maximal correlation ribbon. We show that maximal correlation ribbon satisfies the monotonicity and the tensorization properties, and compute it for multipartite Gaussian states. Detailed proofs of the results in the multipartite case are left for the appendices. We conclude the paper in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a7 REVIEW OF QUANTUM MAXIMAL CORRELATION\n\n\nGiven a bipartite probability distribution p_AB, its maximal correlation is defined as the maximum of the Pearson correlation coefficient over all functions of random variables A and B\u00a0<cit.>. That is, the classical maximal correlation is given by[In the classical literature, maximal correlation is usually denoted by \u03c1. Here in the quantum case, following\u00a0<cit.>, we save \u03c1 for density matrices and denote maximal correlation by \u03bc.]\n\n    \u03bc(A, B) = sup[f_A g_B],\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over all real functions f_A and g_B with zero mean and unit variance, i.e., [f_A]=[g_B] =0 and [f_A^2] = [g_B^2]=1. The classical maximal correlation is zero if and only if the two random variables are independent, and equals one if they have a \u201ccommon bit,\" meaning that there are non-trivial functions f, g such that f(A)= g(B).\n\nMaximal correlation for Gaussian distributions is first computed in\u00a0<cit.>. The main result of\u00a0<cit.> is that in the computation of maximal correlation for a Gaussian distribution p_AB over \u211d^2, it suffices to restrict the optimization in\u00a0(<ref>) to functions f_A and g_B that are linear in A and B, respectively. Based on this, there are essentially unique choices of linear functions f_A and g_B and then \u03bc(A, B) for such a Gaussian distribution p_AB equals\n\n    \u03bc(A, B) =|Cov[A,B]|/\u221a(Var[A]Var[B]),\n\nwhere Cov[A,B]=[A B]-[A][B] and Var[A]=Cov[A,A] is the variance.\n\nMaximal correlation in the quantum case can be defined by replacing functions in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) with  local operators\u00a0<cit.>. Given a density operator \u03c1_AB describing the joint state of a bipartite quantum system, quantum maximal correlation is defined as\n\n    \u03bc(A, B) := sup_X_A, Y_B    |(\u03c1_AB X_A^\u2020\u2297 Y_B)|\n       \u00a0(\u03c1_A X_A) = \u03c1(\u03c1_BY_B) =0,\n       \u00a0(\u03c1_A X_A^\u2020 X_A) = \u03c1(\u03c1_BY_B^\u2020 Y_B) =1,\n\nwhere the supremum is over all choices of local operators X_A, Y_B. Note that, in this definition, these operators are not necessarily hermitian, hence we maximize over the modulus of the objective function (\u03c1_AB X_A^\u2020\u2297 Y_B). In fact, as shown in\u00a0<cit.>[See the updated arXiv version of\u00a0<cit.>.] and discussed in Section\u00a0<ref>, for some quantum states non-hermitian operators are required to further optimize the quantum maximal correlation.\n\n\nAn application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality shows that 0\u2264\u03bc(A, B)\u2264 1. It can be shown that \u03bc(A, B)=0 if and only if \u03c1_AB=\u03c1_A\u2297\u03c1_B is a product state. Note that if \u03c1_AB is not product, there always exist local measurements whose outcomes are correlated and hence their maximal correlation is nonzero. Also, restricting X_A and Y_B to local hermitian operators, one can verify that \u03bc(A, B)=1 if and only if there exist non-trivial local measurements described by operators {\u03a0_A,n}_n=1^d and {\u03a0_B,m}_m=1^d, where d\u22652, such that the joint outcome probability distribution is perfectly correlated\u00a0<cit.>: \n\n    p(n,m)=(\u03c1_AB\u03a0_A,n\u2297\u03a0_B,m)=p_n\u03b4_n,m.\n\nThis form means that the shared state between two parties can be used to extract perfect shared randomness through local measurements. \nBased on this, we can see that \u03bc(A, B)=1 for any pure entangled state |\u03c8_AB\u27e9=\u2211_n c_n|n_A,n_B\u27e9 with {|n_A\u27e9} and {|n_B\u27e9} being the Schmidt bases, and its completely dephased version in the Schmidt bases, \u03c1_AB=\u2211_n |c_n|^2 |n_A\u27e9\u27e8n_A|\u2297|n_B\u27e9\u27e8n_B|, which is a separable state. In these cases, considering observables N_A=\u2211_n h_n|n_A\u27e9\u27e8n_A| and N_B=\u2211_n h_n|n_B\u27e9\u27e8n_B| for subsystems A and B, the optimal local operators in\u00a0(<ref>) can be found as  X_A=(N_A-\u27e8 N_A\u27e9)/\u0394 N_A and Y_B=(N_B-\u27e8 N_B\u27e9)/\u0394 N_B with the identical means \u27e8 N_A\u27e9=\u27e8 N_B\u27e9=\u2211_n |c_n|^2 h_n, and the identical standard deviations, \u0394 N_A=\u0394 N_B=(\u2211_n |c_n|^2 h_n^2-\u27e8 N_A\u27e9^2)^1/2.\n\nMaximal correlation satisfies two crucial properties\n\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n\n  * (Data processing) If \u03c3_A'B' = \u03a6_A\u2192 A'\u2297\u03a8_B\u2192 B'(\u03c1_AB), where \u03a6_A\u2192 A' and \u03a8_B\u2192 B' are local quantum operations (quantum completely-positive trace preserving (cptp) super-operators) then \n\n    \u03bc(A', B') \u2264\u03bc(A, B).\n\n\n\n  * (Tensorization) For any bipartite density matrix \u03c1_AB and any integer n we have\n\n    \u03bc(A^n, B^n) = \u03bc(A, B),\n\nwhere the left hand side is the maximal correlation of the state \u03c1_A^nB^n=\u03c1_AB^\u2297 n considered as a bipartite state. \n\n\nThe first property says that maximal correlation is really a measure of correlation, and does not increase under local operations. The second property, however, is an intriguing property saying that no matter how many copies of \u03c1_AB are shared between two parties, their maximal correlation remains the same. This is unlike most measures of correlations (such as mutual information and entanglement entropy) that scale when the number of copies increase. \n\nThe above two properties of maximal correlation make it suitable for proving impossibility of certain local state transformations. Suppose that \u03c1_AB and \u03c3_A'B' are two bipartite state with \u03bc(A, B)<\u03bc(A', B'). Then, it is not possible to transform \u03c1_AB to \u03c3_A'B' under local operations even if an arbitrary many copies of \u03c1_AB is available.\nThis is because if there exist local operations \u03a6_A^n\u2192 A', \u03a8_B^n\u2192 B' acting on n copies of \u03c1_AB such that \u03c3_A'B' = \u03a6_A^n\u2192 A'\u2297\u03a8_B^n\u2192 B'(\u03c1_AB^\u2297 n), then we must have \n\n    \u03bc(A, B) = \u03bc(A^n, B^n)\u2265\u03bc(A', B'),\n\nwhere the equality is due to the tensorization property and the inequality follows from the data processing inequality.\n\nLet us examine the example of  noisy Bell states. Let \n\n    \u03c1_AB^(\u03ba) = \u03ba|\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8| + (1-\u03ba) 1/4 I,\n\nbe a mixture of the Bell state |\u03c8\u27e9= 1/\u221a(2) (|00\u27e9 + |11\u27e9) and the maximally mixed state I/4 for two qubits with 0\u2264\u03ba\u22641.  It is not hard to verify that \u03bc(A, B) = \u03ba; see\u00a0<cit.>. Thus, by the above observation, local transformation of \u03c1_AB^(\u03ba) to \u03c1_AB^(\u03ba') is impossible if \u03ba'>\u03ba even with arbitrary many copies of \u03c1_AB^(\u03ba). \n\nIt is shown in\u00a0<cit.> that the maximal correlation \u03bc(A, B) of \u03c1_AB is equal to the second Schmidt coefficient of some vector associated to \u03c1_AB in a tensor product Hilbert space. This makes the problem of computing \u03bc(A, B) tractable when the dimensions of the local Hilbert spaces of A, B are finite. In the infinite dimensional case, however, computation of maximal correlation remains a challenge in general.  \n\nOur main result in this paper is to compute the maximal correlation for Gaussian quantum states, which are of great practical interest in quantum information processing. Similar to the classical maximal correlation for Gaussian probability distributions, we show that in the computation of \u03bc(A, B) for Gaussian state \u03c1_AB, the optimization in\u00a0(<ref>) can be restricted to operators X_A, Y_B that are linear in local creation and annihilation operators. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 GAUSSIAN QUANTUM STATES\n\n\nIn this section we review the  definition and some basic properties of Gaussian states. For more details we refer to\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nThe Hilbert space of an m-mode bosonic quantum system  is the space of square-integrable functions on \u211d^2m. We denote the annihilation and creation operators of the j-th mode by _j = (_j+i_j)/\u221a(2) and _j^\u2020 = (_j-i_j)/\u221a(2), where _j and _j are the phase-space quadrature operators, similar to the position and momentum operators of the quantum harmonic oscillator, that satisfy the commutation relations[We assume that \u0127=1.]\n\n    [_j, _k] = i\u03b4_jk.\n\nWe denote by \n\n    \ud835\udc11=(_1, _1, \u2026, _m, _m)^\u22a4,\n\nthe column-vector consisting of quadrature operators. Then, the above commutation relations can be summarized as \n\n    [, ^\u22a4] = i\u03a9_m,\n\nwhere [, ^\u22a4] is understood as coordinate-wise commutataion and \u03a9_m= \u03a9_1\u2295\u22ef\u2295\u03a9_1 with\n\n    \u03a9_1 = [  0  1; -1  0 ].\n\nFor \ud835\udc2b =(r_1, \u2026, r_2m)^\u22a4\u2208\u211d^2m, the m-mode displacement operator (also called the Weyl operaator) D_\ud835\udc2b is defined by\n\n    D_   = e^-i^\u22a4\u03a9_m \n    = e^i\u2211_j=1^m (r_2j_j-r_2j-1_j )\n        = \u2297_j=1^m e^(r_2j_j-r_2j-1_j)\n    = \u2297_j=1^m D_(r_2j-1, r_2j),\n\nwhich is the tensor product of the displacement operators for each mode, and hence is local. We note that D_^\u2020 = D_-. Moreover, as a consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula[If [X, [X, Y]]=[Y, [X, Y]]=0, then e^X+Y = e^Xe^Y e^-1/2[X, Y].] we have\n\n    D_D_ = e^-i 1/2^\u22a4\u03a9_m  D_+.\n\nThis, in particular, means that D_D_^\u2020=D_D_- = D_0= I, i.e., the displacement operator is unitary. \n\nA crucial property of D_ is that[For the proof note that if [X, [X, Y]] = 0, then e^XYe^-X= Y+[X, Y]. Also, see\u00a0<cit.>.] \n\n    D_ D_^\u2020= -.\n\nThis means that D__j D_^\u2020 = _j - r_2j-1 and D__j D_^\u2020 = _j - r_2j, i.e., D_ displaces quadrature operators under conjugation, thus the name.\n\n\nFor an arbitrary m-mode density operator \u03c1 = \u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m, the vector of first-order moments in \u211d^2m is defined as \n\n    (\u03c1) = (\u03c1),\n\nwhich contains the canonical mean values (\u03c1)_2j-1 = (\u03c1_j) and (\u03c1)_2j = (\u03c1_j). The covariance matrix, containing the second-order moments, is defined by\n\n    (\u03c1) = [\u03c1{(- (\u03c1)), (- (\u03c1))^\u22a4}],\n\nwhere {\u00b7, \u00b7} denotes anti-commutation, and as before {(- (\u03c1)), (- (\u03c1))^\u22a4} is understood as coordinate-wise anti-commutation. Thus, (\u03c1) is a (2m)\u00d7 (2m) matrix, that by definition is real and symmetric. Furthermore, it can be shown (see\u00a0<cit.>) that as a consequence of the canonical commutation relations\u00a0(<ref>) we have\n\n    (\u03c1)+i\u03a9_m\u2265 0.\n\nThis, in particular, means that (\u03c1) is positive definite.[Taking the transpose of\u00a0(<ref>) we find that  (\u03c1)-i\u03a9_m\u2265 0. Summing this with the original equation gives (\u03c1)\u2265 0. To verify that (\u03c1) does not have a zero eigenvalue, suppose that (\u03c1)=0 and for = - \u03f5 i \u03a9_m write down the condition ^\u2020(\u03c1)\u2265 -i^\u2020\u03a9_m to conclude that =0.] \n\nLet _j(\u03c1) be the j-th 2\u00d7 2 block on the diagonal of (\u03c1). Then, by definition, the covariance matrix of \u03c1_A_j, the marginal state on the j-th mode, equals (\u03c1_A_j)=_j(\u03c1). Similarly, (\u03c1_A_j), the first-order moments of the marginal state, equals the j-th pair of components of (\u03c1).\n\nLet us examine the effect of the displacement operator on the first and second moments of a density operator. Let \u03c1'=D_^\u2020\u03c1 D_. Then, by\u00a0(<ref>) we have\n\n    (\u03c1')  = (\u03c1')=(\u03c1 D_ D_^\u2020)= (\u03c1)- .\n\nThis implies that  D_(-(\u03c1')) D_^\u2020 =  - (\u03c1) and therefore by (<ref>) we get (\u03c1')=(\u03c1). Thus, the application of the local unitary D_ shifts the first-order moment of \u03c1 but does not change the covariance matrix.\n\n\n\nLet H be a real symmetric matrix. Then 1/2^\u22a4 H is a Hamiltonian that is quadratic in terms of the position and momentum operators. A unitary operator associated to this Hamiltonian equals \n\n    U_H = e^-i1/2^\u22a4 H .\n\nThen, we have\n\n    U_H^\u2020 U_H = S_H ,\n\nwhere S_H = e^\u03a9_m H. This equation can be proven by putting a time parameter t into the picture (replacing H with tH) and thinking of U_H^\u2020 U_H as the time evolution of  in the Heisenberg picture. Then, applying Schr\u00f6dinger's equation and computing [1/2 H ^\u22a4,  ], the desired result follows (see\u00a0<cit.> for more details). We note that since U_H is unitary, \n\n    [U_H^\u2020 U_H, (U_H^\u2020 U_H)^\u22a4] = [^\u22a4, ]=i\u03a9_m.\n\nTherefore, \n\n    i\u03a9_m=[S_H , (S_H )^\u22a4] = S_H [, ^\u22a4] S_H^\u22a4 = iS_H \u03a9_m S_H^\u22a4.\n\nThis means that S_H\u03a9_m S_H^\u22a4 = \u03a9_m and S_H is a symplectic matrix. Thus, for any quadratic Hamiltonian there is an associated symplectic matrix such that\u00a0(<ref>) holds. Conversely, it can be shown that for any symplectic matrix there is a related quadratic Hamiltonian through\u00a0(<ref>).  \n\nLet us now compute the effect of U_H on the first and second moments. Define \u03c1' = U_H \u03c1 U_H^\u2020. Then, using\u00a0(<ref>)  it can be shown that  \n\n    (\u03c1') = S_H (\u03c1),\n\nand \n\n    (\u03c1') = S_H (\u03c1)S_H^\u22a4.\n\n\n\nThe following proposition, that is a special case of\u00a0<cit.>, summarizes the above findings.\n\n\nLet \u03c1=\u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m be an m-mode full-rank density operator. Then there is a local unitary V such that for \u03c1'=V\u03c1 V^\u2020 we have (\u03c1') = 0 and the 2\u00d7 2 blocks on the diagonal of (\u03c1')  are multiples of identity of the form \u03bb_j I with \u03bb_j\u2265 1. Thus, the covariance matrix of the marginal state \u03c1'_A_j equals (\u03c1'_A_j) = \u03bb_j I.\n\n\n\nWe note that when H is block-diagonal with 2\u00d7 2 blocks on the diagonal (one block for each mode), the unitary operator U_H defined in\u00a0(<ref>) is local. The associated symplectic matrix S_H to such an H is also block diagonal since \u03a9_m is block-diagonal. This means that block-diagonal symplectic matrices correspond to local unitaries. \n\nNow, if S_j is the j-block on the diagonal of a block-diagonal S_H, and _j is the j-th 2\u00d7 2 block on the diagonal of the covariance matrix, then by\u00a0(<ref>) the application of the local unitary U_H would change _j to S_j _j S_j^\u22a4. On the other hand, it is well-known that for any 2\u00d7 2 positive definite matrix _j there is a symplectic matrix S_j such that '_j=S_j_j S_j^\u22a4 is a multiple of identity (see\u00a0<cit.>). We note that if '_j = \u03bb_j I, then by\u00a0(<ref>) we have \u03bb_j I+i\u03a9_1\u2265 0 meaning that \u03bb_j\u2265 1.\nPutting these together we find that there is a local unitary operator U_H that brings the covariance matrix to the desired form. \n\nNext, applying an appropriate displacement operator, that is a local unitary, we can shift the first moment to the zero vector. We note that displacement operators do not change the covariance matrix. \n\n\n\n\nThe characteristic function of a density operator \u03c1 is defined by \n\n    \u03c7() = (\u03c1 D_).\n\nCharacteristic function fully determines a density operator via \n\n    \u03c1 = 1/(2\u03c0)^m\u222b_\u211d^2m\u03c7() D_- ^2m.\n\nThe Wigner function function\u00a0<cit.> is then defined as the Fourier transform of the characteristic function\n\n    W() = 1/(2\u03c0)^2m\u222b_\u211d^2m\u03c7() e^i^\u22a4\u03a9_m ^2m.\n\nApplying the inverse Fourier transform we obtain\n\n    (\u03c1 e^-i^\u22a4\u03a9_m ) =\u03c7() = \u222b_\u211d^2m W() e^-i^\u22a4\u03a9_m ^2m.\n\nWe note that this equation holds for any \u2208\u211d^2m. Thus, thinking of both sides as functions of , considering their Taylor expansion and comparing corresponding terms, we realize that the same equation holds for all  beyond real ones. That is, for any\ncomplex \u2208\u2102^2m, we have \n\n    (\u03c1 e^^\u22a4) = \u222b_\u211d^2m W() e^^\u22a4^2m.\n\n\nA quantum state is called Gaussian if its Wigner function is Gaussian. In this case, the Wigner function is specified by the first-order moments =(\u03c1) and the covariance matrix =(\u03c1):\n\n    W() = 1/\u03c0^m \u221a() e^-(-)^\u22a4^-1(-).\n\nBy using the Wigner function, one can verify that the purity of Gaussian states can be calculated as (\u03c1^2)=(2\u03c0)^m\u222b_\u211d^2m W^2() ^2m=1/\u221a(\u03b3). Therefore, pure Gaussian states have \u03b3=1.\n \nThe Wigner function of a marginal state is the marginal distribution of the Wigner function of the joint state. Hence, marginal states of Gaussian state are also Gaussian. Note also that, due to the uncertainty principle, the Wigner function cannot be viewed as the joint probability distribution associated with local measurements.\n\nCoherent states are well-known examples of a single-mode Gaussian states, which are displaced vacuum states. For a complex number \u03b1=(x+ip)/\u221a(2) let |\u03b1\u27e9=D_\u03b1|0\u27e9 where D_\u03b1=exp(\u03b1^\u2020-\u03b1\u0305)=D_(x, p). Then,  (|\u03b1\u27e9)=(x,p)^\u22a4 and (|\u03b1\u27e9)=I, where I is the 2\u00d72 identity matrix[In this paper, I_n denotes the n\u00d7 n identity matrix but we drop the subindex for n=2.]. Other important examples are squeezed-vacuum states |z\u27e9=exp(z(^\u20202-^2)/2)|0\u27e9 with squeezing parameter z and thermal states \u03c1_th=\u222b  e^-|\u03b1|^2/n\u0305/(n\u0305\u03c0)|\u03b1\u27e9\u27e8\u03b1| d^2\u03b1 with mean-photon number n\u0305. The first-order moments of these states are zero and their covariance matrices are (|z\u27e9)=diag(e^2z,e^-2z) and (\u03c1_th)=(2n\u0305+1)I.\n\t\n\nIn general, Gaussian unitary operators that map Gaussian states to Gaussian ones can be described in terms of a displacement operator and a unitary operator associated to Hamiltonians that are quadratic in terms of quadrature operators\u00a0<cit.>. The latter \ncan be written in the form of U_H=e^-1/2 i^\u22a4 H in which H is a (2m)\u00d7 (2m) real symmetric matrix. Letting \u03c1' = U_H \u03c1 U_H^\u2020, it can be shown that  \n\n    (\u03c1') = S_H (\u03c1),\n\nand \n\n    (\u03c1') = S_H (\u03c1)S_H^\u22a4,\n\nwhere S_H = e^\u03a9_m H is a symplectic matrix (satisfying S_H\u03a9_m S_H^\u22a4 = \u03a9_m). \nExamples of single-mode unitary operators are the phase rotation with H_Ro=\u03b8(I-Y) and the symplectic matrix S_Ro=cos(\u03b8) I+isin(\u03b8) Y, and squeezing  with H_Sq=zX and the symplectic matrix S_Sq=diag(e^z,e^-z), where here Y and X are the Pauli matrices. Using these two unitary operations and displacement, any single-mode pure Gaussian state can be transformed to the vacuum state.\n\n\n\nThe following proposition provides a standard form for Gaussian states under local unitaries.\n\n\nLet \u03c1=\u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m be an m-mode Gaussian state. Then, there exists a local Gaussian unitary V such that for \u03c1'=V\u03c1 V^\u2020 we have (\u03c1') = 0 and  _j(\u03c1') = (\u03c1'_A_j) =\u03bb_j I with \u03bb_j\u2265 1. If m=2 we can further assume that the covariance matrix can be in the standard form\n\n    (\u03c1') = [ \u03bb_1 I      ;    ^\u22a4 \u03bb_2 I ],\n\nwith =diag(\u03bd_1,\u03bd_2). \n\n\n\n\tFirst, by applying an appropriate displacement operator, that is a local unitary, we can shift the first-order moments to zero without changing the covariance matrix. Next, to bring the state into the desired form, we use a local unitary operator U_H=e^-1/2 i^\u22a4 H, where H is block-diagonal with 2\u00d7 2 blocks on the diagonal (one block for each mode). This means that block-diagonal symplectic matrices correspond to local unitaries. \n\nNow, suppose that S_H = diag(S_1, \u2026, S_m) is a block-diagonal symplectic matrix with S_j's being 2\u00d7 2 symplectic matrices to be determined. Also, let _j(\u03c1) = (\u03c1_A_j) be the j-th 2\u00d7 2 block on the diagonal of the covariance matrix. By\u00a0(<ref>) we know that the application of the local unitary U_H would change _j(\u03c1) to S_j _j(\u03c1) S_j^\u22a4. By choosing each local unitary to be a phase rotation that diagonalizes _j(\u03c1), followed by a squeezing operator that makes the diagonal elements equal, we get '_j=S_SqjS_Roj_j S_Roj^\u22a4 S_Sqj^\u22a4 =\u03bb_j I with \u03bb_j\u2265 1. Note that \u03bb_j=1 means that the marginal state \u03c1'_A_j is the vacuum state, which is pure and hence cannot be correlated with the other modes. Also,\n\u03bb_j>1 implies a thermal marginal state with mean-photon number n\u0305=(\u03bb_j-1)/2.\nPutting these together we find that there is a local Gaussian unitary operator V= U_H D_, consisting of local displacements, phase rotations and squeezing, that brings the covariance matrix to the desired form with marginal thermal states.\n\n\nFor m=2, the above procedure gives a covariance matrix of the form \n\n    [ \u03bb_1 I     ';   '^\u22a4 \u03bb_2 I ].\n\nHowever, by including further local phase-rotation operations with the block-diagonal symplectic matrix S_H'=diag(S'_Ro1,S'_Ro2) into V, we can get \n\n    [             \u03bb_1 I  S'_Ro1' S'_Ro2^\u22a4; S'_Ro2'^\u22a4S'_Ro1^\u22a4             \u03bb_2 I ],\n\nwhere S'_Ro1' S'_Ro2^\u22a4= is diagonal. Thus, we obtain the standard form of the covariance matrix for bipartite Gaussian states.\n\n\nAnother useful phase-space quasiprobability distribution is the Glauber-Sudarshan P-function\u00a0<cit.> that, in terms of the characteristic function, is given by\n\n    P() = 1/(2\u03c0)^2m\u222b_\u211d^2m\u03c7() e^^\u22a4/4 e^i^\u22a4\u03a9_m  ^2m.\n\nUsing this distribution, a density operator of an m-mode system can be expressed in terms of m-mode coherent states\n\n    \u03c1=\u222b_\u2102^mP(\u03b1) |\u03b1\u27e9\u27e8\u03b1| ^2m\u03b1,\n\nwhere \u03b1=(\u03b1_1,\u03b1_2,\u2026,\u03b1_m)^\u22a4\u2208\u2102^m and by using \u03b1_j=(s_2j-1+is_2j)/\u221a(2) we have P(\u03b1)=2^m P(). For most quantum states the Glauber-Sudarshan P-function either takes negative values or is a highly-singular function, existing as a generalized distribution\u00a0<cit.>; these states are known as nonclassical states\u00a0<cit.>. Quantum states whose P(\u03b1) is a probability density distribution are known as classical states\u00a0<cit.>. For Gaussian states, if \n\n    (\u03c1)=(\u03c1)- I_2m\u22650,\n \nwhere I_2m is the 2m\u00d7 2m identity matrix, then the Fourier transform\u00a0(<ref>) exists and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-function is a Gaussian distribution,\n\n    P() = 1/\u03c0^m \u221a() e^-(-)^\u22a4^-1(-).\n\nIn this case, the state is classical and separable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 AN ORTHONORMAL BASIS FOR LOCAL OPERATORS\n\n\n\nIn this section, we derive an orthonormal basis for the space of (local) operators with respect to a Gaussian state. Let \u03c1 be an arbitrary quantum state which for the sake of simplicity, is assumed to be full-rank. Then, for any pair of operators X, X' we define\n\n    \u27e8 X, X'\u27e9_\u03c1:= (\u03c1 X^\u2020 X').\n\n\u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9_\u03c1 satisfies all the properties of an inner product: it is linear in the second argument and anti-linear in the first argument; also, \u27e8 X, X\u27e9_\u03c1\u2265 0 and equality holds iff[Note that we assume that \u03c1 is full-rank] X=0. Note that the objective function in the maximal correlation\u00a0(<ref>) can be written in terms of this inner product:\n|\u27e8 X_A, Y_B \u27e9_\u03c1_AB|.\nThus, to compute the maximization in\u00a0(<ref>) it would be helpful to compute an orthonormal basis for the space of local operators X_A, Y_B with respect to the inner products associated to\nthe marginal states \u03c1_A=_B(\u03c1_AB) and \u03c1_B=_A(\u03c1_AB), respectively.\n\nLet \u03c1_AB be a two-mode Gaussian state. It is clear from the definition that local unitaries do not change the maximal correlation. Therefore, by using Proposition\u00a0<ref> and without loss of generality, we assume that the covariance matrix of \u03c1_AB is in the standard form\u00a0(<ref>) with (\u03c1_AB)=0.\n\nIn the following, we consider a single-mode thermal state  with ()=0 and ()=\u03bb I with \u03bb> 1. This can be either of the marginal states \u03c1_A or \u03c1_B of the Gaussian state \u03c1_AB.\n\nFor any \u2208\u211d^2, let \n\n    C_ =exp(^\u22a4\u03a5 -\u03bb/4^\u22a4\u03a5\u03a5^\u22a4),\n\nwhere \u03a5 is a 2\u00d7 2 matrix to be determined. Using the BCH formula, we have\n\n    C_^\u2020 C_ = \u03b7  e^(^\u22a4\u03a5\u0305+^\u22a4\u03a5),\n\nwhere \u03a5\u0305 is the entry-wise complex conjugate of \u03a5, and\n\n    \u03b7=exp( -\u03bb/4(^\u22a4\u03a5\u0305\u03a5\u0305^\u22a4 + ^\u22a4\u03a5\u03a5^\u22a4) + i/2^\u22a4\u03a5\u0305\u03a9_1 \u03a5^\u22a4).\n\nThen, by using\u00a0(<ref>) and\u00a0(<ref>), we have\n\n    ( C_^\u2020 C_)    = \u03b7\u222b_\u211d^2 W()   e^(^\u22a4\u03a5\u0305+^\u22a4\u03a5) ^2 \n        =exp(\u03bb/2^\u22a4\u03a5\u0305\u03a5^\u22a4 + i/2^\u22a4\u03a5\u0305\u03a9_1 \u03a5^\u22a4),\n\nwhere W()=exp(-^\u22a4/\u03bb)/(\u03c0\u03bb) is the Wigner function of the thermal state.\nNow let \n\n    \u03a5= 1/\u221a(2)[  1 -i;  1  i ],\n\nwhich is unitary and gives\n\n    \u03a5\u0305\u03a9_1 \u03a5^\u22a4 = [ -i  0;  0  i ].\n\nThis choice of \u03a5 simplifies (<ref>) as\n\n    ( C_^\u2020 C_) \n       =exp((\u03bb+1)r_1 s_1/2+(\u03bb-1)r_2 s_2/2)\n       = \u2211_k, \u2113=0^\u221e1/k! \u2113!((\u03bb+1)r_1 s_1/2)^ k((\u03bb-1)r_2 s_2/2)^\u2113.\n\n\nOn the other hand, we define the operators H_k, \u2113 by expanding C_ as a function of =(r_1, r_2)^\u22a4:\n\n    C_ = \u2211_k, \u2113=0^\u221e1/\u221a(k!\u2113!)\u03b6_0^k(\u03bb)\u03b6_1^\u2113(\u03bb) r_1^k r_2^\u2113  H_k, \u2113,\n\nwith \n\n    \u03b6_0(\u03bb) = \u221a((\u03bb+1) /2),   \u03b6_1(\u03bb) = \u221a((\u03bb-1) /2).\n\nWe note that H_k, \u2113 is a polynomial of the \nquadrature operators  and  of degree k+\u2113. For instance, H_0,0=I and \n\n    H_1, 0 = 1/\u221a(\u03bb+1)(-i), \u00a0 H_0, 1 = 1/\u221a(\u03bb-1)(+i).\n\nBy using the expansion\u00a0(<ref>), we can then write\n\n    (   C_^\u2020 C_) \n       = \u2211_k, \u2113, k', \u2113'\u03b6_0^k+k'(\u03bb)\u03b6_1^\u2113+\u2113'(\u03bb)/\u221a(k!\u2113!k'!\u2113'!) r_1^k r_2^\u2113 s_1^k's_2^\u2113'( H^\u2020_k, \u2113 H_k', \u2113').\n\nComparing this equation with\u00a0(<ref>) we find that \n\n    \u27e8 H_k, \u2113, H_k', \u2113'\u27e9_ = ( H_k, \u2113^\u2020 H_k', \u2113') = \u03b4_k, k'\u03b4_\u2113, \u2113'.\n\n\n\n\nLet  be a single-mode thermal state with ()=0 and ()= \u03bb I with \u03bb> 1. Define operators H_k, \u2113 via\u00a0(<ref>) where C_ is given in\u00a0(<ref>). Then,  \n\n    \u0393={H_k, \u2113:  k, \u2113\u2265 0},\n \nis an orthonormal basis for the space of operators with respect to the inner product \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9_.\n\n\n\nWe have already shown in\u00a0(<ref>) that {H_k, \u2113:  k, \u2113\u2265 0} is an orthonormal set. It remains to show that {H_k, \u2113:  k, \u2113\u2265 0} span the whole space of operators. \n\nLet \ud835\udcb1_t be the space of of polynomials of operators , of degree at most t. In other words,\n\n    \ud835\udcb1_t = span{I, , , ^2, , ^2, \u2026, ^t-1,^t}.\n\nWe note that, as mentioned above, H_k, \u2113 is a polynomial of operators , of degree k+\u2113. Thus,  \n\n    span{H_k, \u2113:  k+\u2113\u2264 t}\u2286\ud835\udcb1_t.\n \nOn the other hand, by the orthogonality relations already established, we know that {H_k, \u2113:  k+\u2113\u2264 t} is an independent set. Thus, computing the dimensions of both sides in the above inclusion, we find that span{H_k, \u2113:  k+\u2113\u2264 t}= \ud835\udcb1_t. Thus, taking union over t\u2265 1, we find that span(\u0393) is equal to \ud835\udcb1_\u221e=\u222a_t \ud835\udcb1_t, i.e., the space of all polynomials of the quadrature operators. On the other hand, we know that the later set spans the whole space of operators.[This is essentially the content of the Stone-von Neumann theorem\u00a0<cit.>.] In fact, \ud835\udcb1_\u221e contains the displacement operators, and any bounded operator can be expressed in terms of displacement operators\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MAXIMAL CORRELATION FOR BIPARTITE GAUSSIAN STATES\n\n\nAs discussed, the maximal correlation is invariant under local unitary transformations. Hence, in order to compute the maximal correlation for bipartite Gaussian states, we can restrict to Gaussian states in the standard form\u00a0(<ref>) through Proposition\u00a0<ref>. Let \u03c1_AB be a bipartite Gaussian state that is in the standard form with first moment (\u03c1_AB)=0 and the covariance matrix\n\n    _AB = (\u03c1_AB) = [ \u03bb_A I      ;    ^\u22a4 \u03bb_B I ],   \u03bd=[ \u03bd_1   0;   0 \u03bd_2 ].\n \nHence, the marginal states are thermal states with the covariance matrices (\u03c1_A) =\u03bb_A I, (\u03c1_A) =\u03bb_B I and (\u03c1_A) = (\u03c1_B)=0.\n\nAccording to Theorem\u00a0<ref>, we know that the sets \n\n    {H_k, \u2113^A:  k, \u2113\u2265 0}\u00a0 and \u00a0{H_k, \u2113^B:  k, \u2113\u2265 0},\n\nare orthonormal bases with respect to the inner products \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9_\u03c1_A and \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9_\u03c1_B, respectively. Here H_k, \u2113^A's and H_k, \u2113^B's are defined in terms of the corresponding quadrature operators and the parameter \u03bb_A and \u03bb_B, respectively. To compute the maximal correlation \u03bc(A, B), we use the above bases to expand the local operator X_A and Y_B. Then, the objective function in the definition\u00a0(<ref>), which is equal to |\u27e8 X_A, Y_B\u27e9_\u03c1_AB|, can be expressed in terms of the inner products \u27e8 H_k, \u2113^A, H_k', \u2113'^B\u27e9_\u03c1_AB, which we compute in the following.\n\nLet C_^A and C_^B be the operator\u00a0(<ref>) in terms of the modal quadrature operators _A=(_A, _A)^\u22a4 and _B=(_B, _B)^\u22a4, respectively.\nAs C_^A and C_^B are local operators and commute, we have\n\n\n    (C_^A)^\u2020 C_^B = \u03c4  e^^\u22a4\u03a5_AB,\n\nwhere \n\u03c4=exp(-\u03bb_A/4^\u22a4\u03a5\u0305\u03a5\u0305^\u22a4-\u03bb_B/4^\u22a4\u03a5\u03a5^\u22a4),\nand\n\n    =[ ;  ], \u00a0 and \u00a0\u03a5= [ \u03a5\u0305  0;  0  \u03a5 ].\n\nThus, by using the Wigner function\u00a0(<ref>), we can compute the following inner product\n\n    \u27e8  C_^A, C_^B\u27e9_\u03c1_AB   =   \u03c4 (\u03c1_AB e^^\u22a4\u03a5_AB)\n       = \u03c4\u222b_\u211d^4 W_\u03c1_AB() e^^\u22a4\u03a5^4 \n        = \u03c4  e^1/4^\u22a4\u03a5_AB\u03a5^\u22a4\n     = e^1/2^\u22a4\u03a5\u0305\u03a5^\u22a4\n        = \u2211_p_00, p_01\n     p_10, p_11\u03c9_00^p_00\u03c9_01^p_01\u03c9_10^p_10\u03c9_11^p_11/p_00!p_01!p_10!p_11!\n    r_1^p_00+p_01 r_2^p_11+p_10\n             \u00d7 s_1^p_00+p_10 s_2^p_01+p_11\n \nwhere \u03c9_00, \u2026, \u03c9_11 are entries of 1/2\u03a5\u0305\u03a5^\u22a4 given by\n\n    [ \u03c9_00 \u03c9_01; \u03c9_10 \u03c9_11 ] = 1/2\u03a5\u0305\u03a5^\u22a4 = 1/4[ \u03bd_1+\u03bd_2 \u03bd_1-\u03bd_2; \u03bd_1-\u03bd_2 \u03bd_1+\u03bd_2 ].\n\nOn the other hand, using the expansion\u00a0(<ref>), we have \n\n    \u27e8  C_^A,     C_^B\u27e9_\u03c1_AB\n       = \u2211_k, \u2113\n     k', \u2113'\u03b1_0^k\u03b1_1^\u2113\u03b2_0^k'\u03b2_1^\u2113'/\u221a(k!\u2113!k'!\u2113'!) r_1^kr_2^\u2113 s_1^k's_2^\u2113'\u27e8 H_k, \u2113^A, H_k', \u2113'^B\u27e9_\u03c1_AB ,\n\nwhere \u03b1_0=\u03b6_0(\u03bb_A), \u03b1_1=\u03b6_1(\u03bb_A),  \u03b2_0=\u03b6_0(\u03bb_B) and \u03b2_1=\u03b6_1(\u03bb_B) are given in\u00a0(<ref>).

Then, the maximal correlation for the Gaussian state is given by\n\n    \u03bc(A, B) = ^(1).\n\nEquivalently, this means that in computing the maximal correlation in\u00a0(<ref>) we may restrict to X_A, Y_B that are linear in quadrature operators.\n\n\n\n\nBy using (<ref>) and (<ref>), the maximal correlation\u00a0(<ref>) for a Gaussian state reads \n\n    \u03bc(A, B) = =max_==1 |^\u2020|,\n\nwhere  is the operator norm of . Given the block structure of  we know that = max_t ^(t). Thus, to prove the theorem we need to show that \n\n    ^(1)\u2265^(t),    \u2200 t>1.\n\nTo this end, we derive an equivalent representation of the matrices ^(t).\n\n\nFor 0\u2264\u2113\u2264 t and =(b_1, \u2026, b_t)\u2208{0,1}^t with ||=\u2211_i b_i define\n\n    s_\u2113, = \u03b4_\u2113, ||\u221a(\u2113!

Thus,\n\n    ^(t)\u2264^t \u2264= ^(1),\n\nand \ntherefore the maximal correlation for a Gaussian state in the standard form becomes\n\n    \u03bc(A, B)    =^(1)=max_==1 | ^\u2020^(1) |.\n\nThis implies that the optimal local operators by using\u00a0(<ref>) can be expressed as a linear combination of quadrature operators\n\n    X_A   =f_0H_1,0^A + f_1H_0,1^A = \u03b1_x _A + \u03b1_p _A,\n    \n    Y_B   =g_0H_1,0^B + g_1H_0,1^B = \u03b2_x _B + \u03b2_p _B,\n\nwhere the coefficients are determined by\u00a0(<ref>). Note that, in general, the coefficients may be complex numbers, and hence the optimal operators may not correspond to local physical observables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 GAUSSIAN MAXIMAL CORRELATION\n\n \nIn this section, we define another measure of correlation for bipartite Gaussian states by restricting the optimization in (<ref>) to Gaussian observables\u00a0<cit.>, i.e., operators that are Hermitian and linear in terms of quadrature operators and correspond to homodyne measurements. We refer to this new correlation measure as the Gaussian maximal correlation which is given by\n\n    \u03bc_G(A, B) = sup_X_A, Y_B(\u03c1_AB X_A\u2297 Y_B),\n\nwhere \u03c1_AB is a bipartite Gaussian state, and X_A, Y_B are local Hermitian observables that are linear in terms of quadrature operators and satisfy (\u03c1_A X_A)= (\u03c1_B Y_B)=0 and (\u03c1_AX_A^2)=(\u03c1_B Y_B^2)=1. Note that by definition, \u03bc_G(A, B)\u2264\u03bc(A, B).\n\n\nSuppose that the covariance matrix of \u03c1_AB is\n\n    _AB = (\u03c1_AB) = [    _A   _AB; _AB^\u22a4    _B ],\n\nand for simplicity assume that (\u03c1_AB)=0. By the restrictions on X_A, Y_B, there are real vectors _A, _B such that X_A=_A^\u22a4_A, Y_B=_B^\u22a4_B and \n\n    1   =(\u03c1_A X_A^2)\n       =1/2( \u03c1_A {X_A, X_A})\n       =1/2_A^\u22a4( \u03c1_A {_A, _A})_A\n       =1/2_A^\u22a4_A _A,\n\nand similarly _B^\u22a4_B _B =2. Note that (\u03c1_A X_A) = (\u03c1_B Y_B)=0 is automatically satisfied since (\u03c1_AB)=0.\nNext, similar to the above computation, it is easily verified that 2(\u03c3_AB X_A\u2297 Y_B)=_A^\u22a4_AB_B. Therefore, rescaling _A, _B by a factor of \u221a(2), the Gaussian maximal correlation reads\n\n    \u03bc_G(A, B) = max__A, _B\u00a0   \u00a0_A^\u22a4_AB_B\n       \u00a0_A^\u22a4_A _A=1\n       \u00a0_B^\u22a4_B _B=1.\n\nWriting the above optimization in terms of _A= _A^1/2_A and _B= _B^1/2_B, we find that \n\n    \u03bc_G(A, B)=_A^-1/2_AB_B^-1/2.\n\nTherefore, for a Gaussian state in the standard form (<ref>) with |\u03bd_1|\u2265|\u03bd_2|, which can always be accomplished by relabeling the phase-space quadratures, the Gaussian maximal correlation becomes\n\n    \u03bc_G(A, B) = |\u03bd_1|/\u221a(\u03bb_A \u03bb_B).\n\nNote that the joint probability distribution p(x_A,x_B) associated with local homodyne measurements on the x-quadratures is Gaussian with Cov[x_A,x_B]=\u03bd_1,  Var[x_A]=\u03bb_A, and Var[x_B]=\u03bb_B. Therefore, comparing this equation with (<ref>), we observe that the Gaussian maximal correlation is in fact the classical maximal correlation of the outcome probability distribution of optimal local homodyne measurements. However, unlike the classical case, (<ref>) shows that  \u03bc_G(A, B) cannot be equal to one, as due to the uncertainty relation\u00a0(<ref>) the covariance matrix of physical states cannot have a zero eigenvalue.\n\nConsidering the characterization of Gaussian cptp maps\u00a0<cit.>, one can verify that \u03bc_G(A, B) is monotone under local Gaussian cptp maps; the point is that under such local super-operators in the Heisenberg picture, linear operators are mapped to linear operators. Therefore, correlations between phase-space quadratures cannot be increased under Gaussian operations. Gaussian maximal correlation also satisfies the tensorization property. To verify this, it suffices to use\u00a0(<ref>), the fact that (\u03c1_AB\u2297\u03c1_A'B') = (\u03c1_AB)\u2295(\u03c1_A'B') and \u03be\u2295\u03b7= max{\u03be, \u03b7}. Therefore, the Gaussian maximal correlation satisfies both the monotonicity and tensorization properties, and therefore can be used to study the local state transformation problem when both resource and target states are Gaussian. For example, this result shows that n copies of a Gaussian in the standard form with the Gaussian maximal correlation\u00a0(<ref>), cannot be locally transformed into another Gaussian state with the same marginal states but with |\u03bd_1'|>|\u03bd_1|.\n\n\n\nWe state yet another reformulation of the Gaussian maximal correlation. Note that \n\n    (_A\u2295_B)^-1/2   _AB (_A\u2295_B)^-1/2\n       = [                 I_A   _A^-1/2_AB_B^-1/2; _B^-1/2_AB^\u22a4_A^-1/2                 I_B ].\n\nThen, using\u00a0(<ref>) we fine that (_A\u2295_B)^-1/2_AB (_A\u2295_B)^-1/2\u2265 1- \u03bc_G(A, B). Therefore, we can write\n\u03bc_G(A, B)=1-V(A,B) where V(A,B)=max{q\u22641:_AB\u2265 q(_A\u2295_B)}. This  formulation of the Gaussian maximal correlation is related to the measure for Gaussian resources\u00a0<cit.> and is reminiscent of the entanglement measure introduced in\u00a0<cit.> for Gaussian states.\nIndeed, the measure of\u00a0<cit.> is defined by V'(A, B)=max{q\u22641:_AB\u2265 q('_A\u2295'_B)} where '_A, '_B are covariance matrices of some quantum states, while in our case they are the covariance matrices of the marginal states of \u03c1_AB. \n\nWe finish this section by emphasizing on the fact that the Gaussian maximal correlation is monotone only if we restrict to local Gaussian operations, while the quantum maximal correlation studies in previous sections is monotone under all local operations.  \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 EXAMPLES\n\nIn this section, we further illustrate various features of the correlation measures by considering examples of Gaussian states. We consider two classes of bipartite Gaussian states that are in the standard form with symmetric marginal states and zero first-order moments.\n\nThe first class of Gaussian states is described by the covariance matrix (<ref>) with \u03bb_A=\u03bb_B=\u03bb>1 and \u03bd_1=-\u03bd_2=\u03bd\u22650. The physicality condition\u00a0(<ref>) implies that \u03bd\u2264\u221a(\u03bb^2-1), and the state is entangled for \u03bb-1<\u03bd<\u221a(\u03bb^2-1). We refer to these states as correlated-anticorrelated (CA) Gaussian states. The maximal correlation for these states, using (<ref>) and (<ref>), is given by\n\n    \u03bc__CA(A,B)   = max_==1[ f\u0305_0 f\u0305_1 ][           0 \u03bd/\u221a(\u03bb^2-1 ); \u03bd/\u221a(\u03bb^2-1 )           0 ][ g_0; g_1 ]\n       =\u03bd/\u221a(\u03bb^2-1),\n \nwhere the maximum is attained for f_0=f_1=g_0=g_1=1/\u221a(2). Hence, optimal local operators using (<ref>) and (<ref>) can be found as X_A=_A^\u2020/\u221a(\u03bb+1)+_A/\u221a(\u03bb-1) and Y_A=_B^\u2020/\u221a(\u03bb+1)+_B/\u221a(\u03bb-1), which are not hermitian and cannot be viewed as physical observables.  \nNote that for \u03bd=\u221a(\u03bb^2-1), the Gaussian state corresponds to a two-mode squeezed vacuum state,\n\n    |\u03c8_AB\u27e9=\u221a(2/\u03bb+1)\u2211_n (\u03bb-1/\u03bb+1)^n/2|n_A,n_B\u27e9,\n\nwhich is a pure entangled state with \u03bc__CA(A,B)=1. Here {|n_A\u27e9} and  {|n_B\u27e9} are the Fock states. Thus, following Section\u00a0<ref>, one can easily verify that for two-mode squeezed vacuum states the maximal correlation of \u03bc=1 can be achieved using local hermitian operators X_A=(_A^\u2020_A-n\u0305)/\u0394 n=H_1,1^A and Y_B=(_B^\u2020_B-n\u0305)/\u0394 n=H_1,1^B, where n\u0305=(\u03bb-1)/2 and \u0394 n=\u221a(\u03bb^2-1)/2 are the mean and the standard deviation of photon-number distribution of the marginal states. This implies that the same maximal correlation can be obtained for two-mode squeezed vacuum states by using local hermitian operators that are quadratic in the phase-space quadrature operators. This means that, in general, optimal local operators for the maximal correlation are not unique.\n\nAs discussed, the maximal correlation for Gaussian states can be used to study the local state transformation problem when the target state is not Gaussian. For example, by using (<ref>), it can be seen that any arbitrary number of copies of CA Gaussian states cannot be locally transformed into the noisy Bell state\u00a0(<ref>) without classical communication if \u03bd<\u03ba\u221a(\u03bb^2-1). Note, however, that if two states have the same amount of the maximal correlation, it is not clear whether or how the two states can locally be transformed into one another in general. \n\nWe also consider a second class of Gaussian states described by the covariance matrix (<ref>) with \u03bb_A=\u03bb_B=\u03bb>1 and \u03bd_1=\u03bd_2=\u03bd\u22650. Note that for all physical values of \u03bd\u2264\u03bb-1, these states are separable with a nonnegative Glauber-Sudarshan P-function. We refer to these states as correlated-correlated (CC) Gaussian states. Using\u00a0(<ref>) and (<ref>), the maximal correlation is given by\n\n    \u03bc__CC(A,B)   = max_==1[ f\u0305_0 f\u0305_1 ][ \u03bd/\u03bb+1      ;     0 \u03bd/\u03bb-1 ][ g_0; g_1 ]\n       =\u03bd/\u03bb-1.\n \nHere, for g_0=f_0=0 and  g_1=f_1=1, we can see that optimal local operators X_A=_A\u221a(2/(\u03bb-1)) and Y_B=_B/\u221a(2/(\u03bb-1)) are not hermitian again. Of particular interest is the case of \u03bd=\u03bb-1 where \u03bc__CC(A,B)=1. In this case, the Gaussian state can be written as\n\n    \u03c1_AB=\u222b2e^-2|\u03b1|^2/(\u03bb-1)/(\u03bb-1)\u03c0|\u03b1\u27e9\u27e8\u03b1|\u2297|\u03b1\u27e9\u27e8\u03b1|^2\u03b1.\n\nUsing this representation, we can see that for any local measurements {\u03a0_A,n: n} and  {\u03a0_B,m: m}, \n\n    (\u03c1_AB\u03a0_A,n\u2297\u03a0_B,m)=\u222b   2e^-2|\u03b1|^2/(\u03bb-1)/(\u03bb-1)\u03c0\u27e8\u03b1|\u03a0_A,n|\u03b1\u27e9\n       \u00d7\u27e8\u03b1|\u03a0_B,m|\u03b1\u27e9^2\u03b1\u22600,\n\nfor any n and m. \nNote that here the positivity of measurement operators implies \u27e8\u03b1|\u03a0_B,n|\u03b1\u27e9\u22650 and \u27e8\u03b1|\u03a0_A,m|\u03b1\u27e9\u22650. Also, \u27e8\u03b1|\u03a0|\u03b1\u27e9 is, in general, an everywhere convergent power series in terms of \u03b1 and \u03b1\u0305 and cannot be identical to zero on some nontrivial region, unless \u03a0=0\u00a0<cit.>. Therefore, \u27e8\u03b1|\u03a0_A,n|\u03b1\u27e9\u27e8\u03b1|\u03a0_B,m|\u03b1\u27e9 cannot be zero almost everywhere. As the joint outcome probability distribution\u00a0(<ref>) is not in the form of\u00a0(<ref>), \u03bc__CC(A,B)=1 for \u03bd=\u03bb-1 cannot be achieved using hermitian local operators. This example shows that the maximal correlation of continuous-variable systems must be optimized over all hermitian and non-hermitian local operators.\n\n\nIt is easy to verify that even for non-Gaussian bipartite states of this form\n\n    \u03c1_AB=\u222b P(\u03b1) |\u03b1\u27e9\u27e8\u03b1|\u2297|\u03b1\u27e9\u27e8\u03b1|^2\u03b1,\n\nwhere P(\u03b1) is not necessarily Gaussian, the quantum maximal correlation of one is achieved using non-hermitian local operators X_A=(_A-\u27e8_A\u27e9)/\u0394_A and Y_B=(_B-\u27e8_B\u27e9)/\u0394_B with \u27e8_A\u27e9=\u27e8_A\u27e9=\u222b P(\u03b1)\u03b1 ^2\u03b1 and \u0394_A^2=\u222b P(\u03b1)|\u03b1|^2 ^2\u03b1-\u27e8_A\u27e9^2=\u0394_B^2. This fact can also be verified by examples of two-qubit states; see the updated arXiv version of\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\nComparing the maximal correlation of the CC and CA states for the same marginal states and 0\u2264\u03bd\u2264\u03bb-1, in which case both states are separable, we can see that \u03bc__CC(A,B)<\u03bc__CA(A,B). Although the only difference between the two classes is the sign of the correlation, this shows that any arbitrary number of copies of the CC state cannot be  transformed to the CA state by local operations and without classical communication. We note, however, that these two states have the same amount of Gaussian maximal correlation since by\u00a0(<ref>)  \n\n    \u03bc_G_CA(A,B)=\u03bc_G_CC(A,B)=\u03bd/\u03bb.\n\nHence, although the maximal correlation gives impossibility of local state transformation of the CC state to the CA state, the Gaussian maximal correlation cannot detect this. We also note that for these states the Gaussian maximal correlation is strictly less than the maximal correlation given by\u00a0(<ref>) and\u00a0(<ref>). \n\nAs an application of the Gaussian maximal correlation measure, suppose that a third party prepares a CA state \u03c1_AB and sends one subsystem to Alice and the other one to Bob through lossy channels. The covariance matrix of the shared state between Alice and Bob is given by\u00a0<cit.>\n\n    [ (\u03c4_A\u03bb+1-\u03c4_A) I   \u221a(\u03c4_A\u03c4_B)\u03bd Z;   \u221a(\u03c4_A\u03c4_B)\u03bd Z  (\u03c4_B\u03bb+1-\u03c4_B)I;                ],\n\nwhere 0\u2264\u03c4_A\u22641 and 0\u2264\u03c4_B\u22641 are the transmissivities of lossy channels to Alice and Bob, and Z=diag(1,-1).  We can then see that, if \u03c4_A<1 and/or \u03c4_B<1, the Gaussian maximal correlation of the shared state is less than the Gaussian maximal correlation of the initial state,\n\n    \u221a(\u03c4_A\u03c4_B)\u03bd/\u221a((\u03c4_A\u03bb+1-\u03c4_A)(\u03c4_B\u03bb+1-\u03c4_B))<\u03bd/\u03bb.\n\nTherefore, using any arbitrary number of copies of the shared state and without classical communication, Alice and Bob cannot locally retrieve the initial state \u03c1_AB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MULTIPARTITE GAUSSIAN STATES\n\n\nClassical maximal correlation for multipartite probability distributions is first defined in\u00a0<cit.>. The maximal correlation of an m-partite distribution is a subset of [0,1]^m, called the maximal correlation ribbon. This subset for m=2 is fully characterized in terms of  a single number that is the (bipartite) maximal correlation\u00a0<cit.>. Thus, the maximal correlation ribbon is really a generalization of the (bipartite) maximal correlation. Moreover, maximal correlation ribbon satisfies the data processing and tensorization properties, which are required for the local state transformation problem in the multipartite case.\n\n\nIn this section, we first generalize the classical notion of the maximal correlation ribbon for multipartite quantum states. Then, we characterize the quantum maximal correlation ribbon for multipartite Gaussian states. Here, we briefly discuss these results and give the details in  Appendix\u00a0<ref> and Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\nFollowing the definition of the maximal correlation ribbon in the classical case\u00a0<cit.>, in order to define a quantum maximal correlation ribbon we first need a notion of quantum conditional expectation. Let \u03c1_A^m=\u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m be an m-partite quantum state, and let \u03c1_A_j, j=1, \u2026, m be its marginal states. For simplicity we assume that \u03c1_A_j is full-rank for all j. Then, for any 1\u2264 j\u2264 m define the super-operator (\u00b7) by\n\n    _j(X) = _ j (X\u03c1_A^m\u03c1_A_j^-1),\n\nwhere by _ j we mean tracing out all the subsystems except the j-th one. _j(\u00b7) behaves like a \u201cconditional expectation\" whose properties are given in Lemma\u00a0<ref> in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\n\nNext, recall that the variance of an operator X is defined by\n\n    (X)    = \u27e8 X, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m - |(\u03c1_A^mX)|^2\n       = \u27e8 X-(\u03c1_A^mX) I, X-(\u03c1_A^mX) I\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m\n       = X-(\u03c1_A^mX) I^2,\n\nwhere as before \u27e8 X, Y\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m = (\u03c1_A^m X^\u2020 Y). \n\n\n\n\tFor an m-partite quantum state \u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m let (A_1, \u2026, A_m)\u2286 [0,1]^m be the set of tuples (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m) such that for any operator X=X_A^n we have\n\t\n    (X)\u2265\u2211_j \u03b8_j (_j(X)).\n\n\tWe call  (A_1, \u2026, A_m) the maximal correlation ribbon (MC ribbon) of \u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m.\n\n\n\nRemark that since (X)\u2265 0, in the definition of (A_1, \u2026, A_m) we restrict to \u03b8_j\u2265 0. Moreover, as shown in Lemma\u00a0<ref> in Appendix\u00a0<ref>, we have \n\n    (X)\u2265(_j(X)),   \u2200 j.\n\nThus,\u00a0(<ref>) implies \u03b8_j\u2264 1. This is why (A_1, \u2026, A_m) is defined as a subset of [0,1]^m. Moreover, by\u00a0(<ref>), any (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208 [0,1]^m with \u2211_j \u03b8_j\u2264 1 belongs to (A_1, \u2026, A_m) for any \u03c1_A^m. Thus, the interesting part of (A_1, \u2026, A_m) is the subset [0,1]^m beyond the above trivial subset. Finally, from the definition, it is clear that (A_1, \u2026, A_m) is a convex set. See Figure\u00a0<ref> for a typical shape of the MC\u00a0ribbon. \n\n  \n\nIt can be shown that for product states \u03c1_A^m= \u03c1_A_1\u2297\u22ef\u2297\u03c1_A_m, the MC\u00a0ribbon is the largest possible set: (A_1, \u2026, A_m)= [0,1]^m. On the other hand, for the maximally entangled state 1/\u221a(2)(|00\u27e9 +|11\u27e9), the MC\u00a0ribbon consists of only trivial points: (A_1, A_2)= {(\u03b8_1, \u03b8_2)\u2208 [0,1]^2: \u2211_j \u03b8_j\u2264 1 }. See Appendix\u00a0<ref> for more details.\n\nIn particular, as shown in Theorem\u00a0<ref> in Appendix\u00a0<ref> when m=2, the pair (\u03b8_1, \u03b8_2)\u2208 [0,1]^2 belongs to (A_1, A_2) if and only if\n\n    (1/\u03b8_1 -1 )(1/\u03b8_2 -1 )\u2265\u03bc^2(A_1, A_2),\n\nwhere \u03bc(A_1, A_2) is the maximal correlation of the bipartite state. This shows that the  MC\u00a0ribbon can be viewed as the generalization of the maximal correlation.\n\nAs shown in Theorem\u00a0<ref> in Appendix\u00a0<ref>, maximal correlation ribbon also satisfies the data processing and the tensorization properties:\n\n\t\n  * (Data processing) For local quantum operations \u03a6^(j)_A_j\u2192 A'_j, if\n\t\n    \u03c3_A'^m = \u03a6^(1)_A_1\u2192 A'_1\u2297\u22ef\u2297\u03a6^(m)_A_m\u2192 A'_m(\u03c1_A^m),\n\n\tthen (A_1, \u2026, A_m)\u2286(A'_1, \u2026, A'_m).\n\t\n\t\n  * (Tensorization) For any \u03c1_A^m and any integer n we have\n\t\n    (A_1^n,\u2026, A_m^n) = (A_1,\u2026,  A_m),\n\n\twhere the left hand side is the MC ribbon of \u03c1_A^m^\u2297 n.\n\n\nThese two properties show that the MC\u00a0ribbon is a relevant invariant for the local state transformation problem in the multipartite case. \n\nNow we get to our main problem, namely, how to compute the MC\u00a0ribbon for multipartite Gaussian states. The following theorem, that is a generalization of Theorem\u00a0<ref>, is our main result in this direction.\n\n (Informal)\n\tTo compute the MC\u00a0ribbon for Gaussian state it suffices to restrict X in\u00a0(<ref>) to operators that are linear in phase-space quadrature operators.\n\n\nFor a formal statement of this result and its proof see Appendix\u00a0<ref>. \n\nMotivated by the definition of the Gaussian maximal correlation\u00a0(<ref>), we can define a Gaussian maximal correlation ribbon for multipartite Gaussian states as follows. For an m-mode Gaussian state \u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m let _G(A_1, \u2026, A_m) be the set of tuples (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208 [0,1]^m satisfying \n\t\n    (\u2211_j=1^m X_j) \u2264\u2211_j=1^m 1/\u03b8_j(X_j),\n\n\tfor all local operators X_1, \u2026, X_m that are hermitian and linear in terms of phase-space quadrature operators. We note that, by Theorem\u00a0<ref> in Appendix\u00a0<ref>, removing the latter constraints on X_j's, we recover (A_1, \u2026, A_m). Therefore, we have (A_1, \u2026, A_m)\u2286_G(A_1, \u2026, A_m). Moreover, it is not hard to verify that _G(A_1, \u2026, A_m) is monotone under the action of local Gaussian operations and satisfies tensorization (in the sense of Theorem\u00a0<ref>).\n\nTo find an equivalent characterization of _G(A_1, \u2026, A_m),\n\ta straightforward computation as in the bipartite case shows that (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m) belongs to _G(A_1, \u2026, A_m) if and only if \n\t\n    [ 1/\u03b8_1_A_1         0         \u22ef         0;         0 1/\u03b8_2_A_2         \u22ef         0;         \u22ee         \u22ee         \u22f1         \u22ee;         0         0         \u22ef 1/\u03b8_m_A_m ]\u2265_A_1, \u2026, A_m,\n\n\twhere _A_1, \u2026, A_m is the covariance matrix of \u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m and _A_j is the covariance matrix of its marginal \u03c1_A_j.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISCUSSION\n\n\nThe maximal correlation is of particular interest for the local state transformation problem, where two parties are restricted to local operations but do not have access to classical communication. \nWe have shown that the maximal correlation for bipartite Gaussian states can be simply calculated by restricting the optimization to local operators that are linear in terms of the phase-space quadrature operators. These optimal local operators may not be hermitian and therefore the maximal correlation, in general, is an upper bound on the classical maximal correlation of the joint outcome probability distribution associated with optimal local measurements (local hermitian observables). Using our results, one can investigate the problem of local state transformation with local operations when either the resource or the target state is Gaussian.\n\nWe have also introduced the Gaussian maximal correlation, as another measure of correlation for Gaussian states, by restricting the optimization to the class of hermitian and linear operators in terms of quadrature operators. This measure corresponds to performing optimal homodyne measurements on the phase-space quadratures, and is relevant to the local state transformation when both the resource and the target states are Gaussian. Nevertheless, we have shown through examples, that sometimes the maximal correlation gives stronger bounds on the local state transformation \ncompared to the Gaussian maximal correlation even if both the states are Gaussian.\n\n\nAn interesting question, motivated by the definition of the Gaussian maximal correlation, is whether one can define other variants of maximal correlation by considering hermitian local operators that are quadratic or higher order in terms of quadrature operators. As we have shown for two-mode squeezed vacuum states, the optimal local measurements yielding the maximal correlation of one are photon-counting measurements that are non-Gaussian. This suggests that the maximization in the Gaussian maximal correlation can be further optimized using hermitian and quadratic operators in terms of quadrature operators. We leave the study of the properties of such invariants for future works.\n\n\nWe have also generalized the maximal correlation to the quantum maximal correlation ribbon for the multipartite case. We have shown that the quantum maximal correlation ribbon of Gaussian states can also be computed by restricting to local operators that are linear in terms of quadrature operators. Further, we have discussed its Gaussian version based on using Gaussian local observables.\n\nIn this paper, both in the bipartite and multipartite cases, in the computation of maximal correlation for Gaussian states we assume that each subsystem consists of a single mode. Another interesting problem it to generalize our results to cases where each party can have more than one mode of the shared Gaussian state. For example, one can consider the maximal correlation of a Gaussian state \u03c1_AB in which each subsystem A, B consists of two modes.\n\nHypercontractivity ribbon is another invariant of quantum states that gives bounds on the local state transformation problem\u00a0<cit.>. It would be interesting to compute the hypercontractivity ribbon for Gaussian states. \n\nFinally, the quantum maximal correlation is really a measure of correlation and not a measure of entanglement, as it can take its maximum value on separable states. It is desirable to find a measure of entanglement that satisfies the tensorization property; see\u00a0<cit.> for an attempt  in this direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\tfxundefined [1]\n\t\tifx#1\n\t\n\tfnum [1]\n\t\t#1firstoftwo\n\t\tsecondoftwo\n\t\t\n\tfx [1]\n\t\t#1firstoftwo\n\t\tsecondoftwo\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tnoop [0]secondoftwo\n\t\n\tref[1]@startlink#1@href\n\thref[1]#1@endlink\n\tanitize@url [0]`\n12`$12`&12`#12`1\u03022`_12`%12\n\tstartlink[1]\n\tendlink[0]\n\t\n\trl [1]href #1\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t@bib@innerbibempty\n\t\n\t[Bennett et\u00a0al.(1996a)Bennett, Bernstein, Popescu, and Schumacher]BennettPRA1996\n\tauthor author C.\u00a0H.

We start with the conditional expectation operator defined by\n\n    _j(X) = _ j (X\u03c1_A^m\u03c1_A_j^-1),\n\nwhere _ j means partial trace with respect to all subsystems except the j-th one. We note that _j maps an operator acting on the whole system A^m to an operator acting only on the j-th subsystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n  * If Y is an operator acting on the j-th subsystem, then for any X we have\n\n    \u27e8 Y, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m = \u27e8 Y, _j(X)\u27e9_\u03c1_A_j,\n\nwhere the inner product is given in\u00a0(<ref>).\n\n  * _j is a projection, i.e., _j^2=_j.\n\n  * _j is self-adjoint with respect to the inner product \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m. \n\n  * For an operator X define its variance by\n\n    (X)    = X-(\u03c1_A^mX) I_\u03c1_A^m^2\n       = \u27e8 X-(\u03c1_A^mX) I, X-(\u03c1_A^mX) I\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m\n       = \u27e8 X, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m - |(\u03c1_A^mX)|^2.\n\nThen, we have\n\n    (X) = (_j(X)) + (X-_j(X)).\n\nMoreover, since (X-_j(X))\u2265 0 we have  (X)\u2265(_j(X)).\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation\u00a0(<ref>) can be understood as a quantum generalization of the law of total variance. \n\n\n(i) Since Y acts on the j-th subsystem we have\n\n    \u27e8 Y, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m   = (\u03c1_A^m Y^\u2020 X) = (Y^\u2020 X \u03c1_A^m) = (Y^\u2020_ j(X \u03c1_A^m) ) =  ( \u03c1_A_jY^\u2020_ j(X \u03c1_A^m) \u03c1_A_j^-1)\n       = ( \u03c1_A_jY^\u2020_ j(X \u03c1_A^m\u03c1_A_j^-1)  )= \u27e8 Y, _j(X)\u27e9_\u03c1_A_j.\n\n\n(ii) We need to show that for Y_A_j, acting on the j-th subsystem, we have _j(Y)=Y. We compute\n\n    _j(Y)= _ j(Y\u03c1_A^m\u03c1_A_j^-1) = Y _ j(\u03c1_A^m) \u03c1_A_j^-1=Y \u03c1_A_j\u03c1_A_j^-1=Y.\n\n\n(iii) We need to show that \u27e8_j(X), Y\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m = \u27e8 X, _j(Y)\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m. We compute\n\n    \u27e8_j(X), Y\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m    = (\u03c1_A^m_j(X)^\u2020 Y) = ( \u03c1_A^m_ j(X\u03c1_A^m\u03c1_A_j^-1)^\u2020 Y  ) \n       = (  _ j(X\u03c1_A^m\u03c1_A_j^-1)^\u2020_ j (Y\u03c1_A^m)  ) = (  _ j( \u03c1_A_j^-1\u03c1_A^m X^\u2020) _ j (Y\u03c1_A^m)  ) \n       = (  \u03c1_A_j^-1_ j(  \u03c1_A^m X^\u2020) _ j (Y\u03c1_A^m)  ) = (   _ j(  \u03c1_A^m X^\u2020) _ j (Y\u03c1_A^m) \u03c1_A_j^-1) \n       = (   _ j(  \u03c1_A^m X^\u2020) _ j (Y\u03c1_A^m\u03c1_A_j^-1)  )\n    = (    \u03c1_A^m X^\u2020_ j (Y\u03c1_A^m\u03c1_A_j^-1)  ) \n       = (\u03c1_A^m X^\u2020_j(Y))\n       = \u27e8 X, _j(Y)\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m.\n\n\n(iv) Let Y=X-_j(X). By (i) and the fact that I_A^m can be considered as an operator acting on the j-th subsystem, we have \u27e8 I_A^m, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m = \u27e8 I_A_j, _j(X)\u27e9_\u03c1_A_j\n and (\u03c1_A^mY) = \u27e8 I_A^m, Y\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m = 0. This, in particular, means that (\u03c1_A^mX)=  (\u03c1_A_j_j(X)). Therefore,\n\n    (Y)    = \u27e8 Y, Y\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m= \u27e8 X-_j(X), X-_j(X)\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m\n       = \u27e8 X, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m -\u27e8 X, _j(X)\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m - \u27e8_j(X), X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m +\u27e8_j(X), _j(X)\u27e9_\u03c1_A_j\n       = \u27e8 X, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m -\u27e8_j(X), _j(X)\u27e9_\u03c1_A_j\n       = \u27e8 X, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m + |(\u03c1_A^mX)|^2 -  |(\u03c1_A_j_j(X))|^2 -\u27e8_j(X), _j(X)\u27e9_\u03c1_A_j\n       = (X) - (_j(X)),\n\nwhere in the third line we use (i).\n\n\n\n\nNow recall that the maximal correlation ribbon is defined by\n\n    (A_1, \u2026, A_m) = {(\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m): (X)\u2265\u2211_j \u03b8_j (_j(X)), \u2200 X}.\n\nIn the above definition (when the underlying Hilbert space is infinite dimensional), X runs over the space _A^m of operators for which \u27e8 X, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m is finite. We note that for such an X\u2208_A^m, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (\u03c1_A^m X)=\u27e8 I,  X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m is also finite. Moreover, by the low of total variance established in Lemma\u00a0<ref>, _j maps _A^m to _j, the space of operators X_j acting on the j-th subsystem with \u27e8 X_j, X_j\u27e9_\u03c1_j<\u221e. Thus, (A_1, \u2026, A_m) is well-defined even in the infinite dimensional case.\n\n\nTo establish (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208(A_1, \u2026, A_m) we need to verify an inequality for all operators X\u2208_A^m acting on the whole system A^m. In the following we show that we may restrict X to be a linear combination of local operators belonging to _j. We note that \n\n    =_1+\u22ef + _m\u2282_A^m,\n \nis a subspace of _A^m, where _1+\u22ef + _m is the closure of the subspace _1+\u22ef + _m. Moreover, _A^m is equipped with the inner product \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m. Thus, we may consider the orthogonal complement of  in _A^m:\n\n    = ^\u22a5,     _A^m = \u2295=(_1+\u22ef + _m)\u2295.\n\nLet Y\u2208. Then, by the orthogonality condition and part (i) of Lemma\u00a0<ref> for X_A_j\u2208_j\u2282  we have\n\n    0=\u27e8 Y, X_A_j\u27e9_\u03c1_A^n= \u27e8_j(Y), X_A_j\u27e9_\u03c1_A_j.\n\nThus, _j(Y) is an operator acting on the j-th subsystem that is orthogonal to all local operators in _j. This means that _j(Y)=0 for all j and Y\u2208. Moreover, since I_A^m\u2208 we have (\u03c1_A^mY)=\u27e8 I_A^m, Y\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m =0.\n\n\nIn the definition of the MC\u00a0ribbon in\u00a0(<ref>) we may restrict to X\u2208. That is, we may restrict to operators that are linear combinations of local ones. Moreover, we may assume that (\u03c1_A^mX)=0. \n\n\n\nFirst, by continuity we may assume that X belongs to (_1+\u22ef + _m)\u2295\u2286(_1+\u22ef + _m)\u2295 = _A^m. \nSuch an X can be written as \n\n    X = X_1+\u22ef + X_m + Y,\n\nwhere X_j\u2208_j and Y\u2208. Let X'=X_1+\u22ef + X_m\u2208. Then, by the above discussion we have _j(X) = _j(X'). Moreover, using \u27e8 X', Y\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m=0 and (\u03c1_A^mY) we have\n\n    (X)    = (X' + Y) =\u27e8 X'+Y - (\u03c1_A^mX'), X'+Y - (\u03c1_A^mX')\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m\n       =\u27e8 X' - (\u03c1_A^mX'), X' - (\u03c1_A^mX')\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m + \u27e8 Y , Y \u27e9_\u03c1_A^m\n        = (X') + (Y)\n       \u2265(X').\n\nPutting these together we find that if the inequality in\u00a0(<ref>) holds for X', then it holds for X. \n\nWe also note that (X) = (X+ cI_A^n) and (_j(X)) = (_j(X) + cI_A_j)=(_j(X+ cI_A^n)). Thus, without loss of generality we can assume that X in\u00a0(<ref>) satisfies (\u03c1_A^mX)=0.\n\n\n\nFor any 1\u2264 j\u2264 m let \n\n    _j^0 = {X\u2208_j: (\u03c1_A_j X)=0},\n\nand ^0 = _1^0+\u22ef+ _m^0. Observe that _j^0 is the orthogonal complement of the identity operator in _j, and we have\n\n    _A^m = \u2102I\u2295_m^0\u2295.\n\nBy the above proposition, in the definition of the MC\u00a0ribbon we may restrict to X\u2208_1^0+\u22ef+ _m^0.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor any 1\u2264 j\u2264 m let \n{F_j,k: k=1, 2, \u2026}\u2282_j^0,\nbe an orthonormal basis for _j^0, where _j^0 is defined in\u00a0(<ref>). Define\n\n    g_jk, j'k':= \u27e8 F_j, k, F_j', k'\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m,\n\nand let \ud835\udca2=(g_jk, j'k') be the Gram matrix associated with the set \u22c3_j {F_j,k: k=1, 2, \u2026}. Also for (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208 [0,1]^m let \u0398 be the diagonal matrix \n\n    \u0398_jk, j'k'=\u03b4_j, j'\u03b4_k, k'\u03b8_j.\n\nThen (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208(A_1, \u2026, A_m) if and only if \n\u0398^-1\u2265,\nmeaning that \u0398^-1- is positive semidefinite. Equivalently, (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208(A_1, \u2026, A_m) if and only if for every X_j\u2208_j^0, j=1, \u2026, m, we have\n\n    (\u2211_j=1^m X_j) \u2264\u2211_j=1^m 1/\u03b8_j(X_j).\n\n\n\n\nBy assumption any X\u2208^0 can be written as\n\n    X= \u2211_j=1^m \u2211_k c_jk F_j, k.\n\nSince (\u03c1_A^mX)=0 we have\n\n    (X) =\u27e8 Y, Y\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m = \u2211_j, j'=1^m \u2211_k, k'c\u0305_jk c_j'k'\u27e8 F_j, k, F_j', k'\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m = ^\u2020,\n\nwhere  is the vector of coefficients c_jk. Next, using _j(X)\u2208_j^0 we have\n\n    (_j(X))    = \u27e8_j(X), _j(X)\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m\n       = _j(X)^2\n       = \u2211_k |\u27e8 F_j, k, _j(X)\u27e9_\u03c1_A_j |^2 \n       = \u2211_k |\u27e8 F_j, k, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m |^2 \n       = \u2211_k |\u2211_j', k' c_j'k' g_jk, j'k'|^2.\n\nAlso, a simple computation shows that \n\n    \u2211_j=1^m \u03b8_j (_j(X))  =\u2211_j=1^m \u03b8_j (\u2211_k |\u2211_j', k' c_j'k' g_jk, j'k'|^2) = ^\u2020 G^\u2020\u0398.\n\nTherefore, (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208(A_1,\u2026, A_m) if and only if \n\n\n    ^\u2020\u2265^\u2020\u0398.\n\nEquivalently, this means that \u2265^\u2020\u0398. Now note that  is the Gram matrix of a linearly independent set, and is invertible. Hence, multiplying both sides from left and right by ^-1=(^\u2020)^-1, we find that \u2265\u0398 is equivalent to ^-1\u2265\u0398. Next, using the fact that t\u21a6 1/t is operator monotone\u00a0<cit.>, we obtain the equivalence of (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208(A_1, \u2026, A_m) and\n\n    \u0398^-1\u2265.\n\nThis equation means that for any  we have ^\u2020\u0398^-1\u2265^\u2020. Then, thinking of  as the vector of coefficients of the expansions of operators X_j\u2208_j^0 in  bases {F_j, k:  k=1, 2, \u2026} for j=1, \u2026, m, and following similar calculations as above, it is not hard to verify that the above equation is equivalent to\u00a0(<ref>).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us use this theorem to compute the MC\u00a0ribbon for the example of a product state \u03c1_A^m=\u03c1_A_1\u2297\u22ef\u03c1_A_m. In this case, for basis operators F_j, k, F_j', k' with j\u2260 j' we have\n\n    \u27e8 F_j, k, F_j', k'\u27e9_\u03c1_A^m = (\u03c1_A_j\u2297\u03c1_A_j'  F_j, k^\u2020\u2297 F_j', k'  ) \n    = (\u03c1_A_j F_j, k^\u2020)(\u03c1_A_j' F_j', k'  )=0.\n\nThus, the Gram matrix  is the identity matrix. In this case, for any (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208 [0,1]^m and its associated matrix \u0398 we have \u0398^-1\u2265. This means that (A_1, \u2026, A_m) =[0,1]^m. That is, for product states, the MC\u00a0ribbon is the largest possible set. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe following theorem shows that MC\u00a0ribbon is really a generalization of the maximal correlation in the bipartite case.\n\n\nIn the case of m=2 we have\n\n    (A_1, A_2) = {(\u03b8_1, \u03b8_2)\u2208 [0,1]^2: (1/\u03b8_1 -1 )(1/\u03b8_2 -1 )\u2265\u03bc^2(A_1, A_2))}.\n\n\n\n\nBy Theorem\u00a0<ref>, (\u03b8_1, \u03b8_2)\u2208 [0,1]^2 belongs to (A_1, A_2) iff for any X_j\u2208_j^0, j=1, 2 we have\n\n    (X_1+X_2)\u22641/\u03b8_1(X_1) +1/\u03b8_2(X_2).\n\nWe note that since (\u03c1_A_1X_1)=(\u03c1_A_2X_2)=0 we have \n\n    (X_1+X_2) = \u27e8 X_1, X_1\u27e9_\u03c1_A_1+\u27e8 X_2, X_2\u27e9_\u03c1_A_2 + 2Re\u27e8 X_2, X_1\u27e9_\u03c1_A^2.\n\nThen, (\u03b8_1, \u03b8_2)\u2208(A_1, A_2) iff for every X_j\u2208_j^0, j=1, 2 we have\n\n    2Re\u27e8 X_2, X_1\u27e9_\u03c1_A^2\u2264(1/\u03b8_1-1) (X_1) +(1/\u03b8_2-1) (X_2).\n\nScaling X_1, X_2 and replacing them with c_1X_1, c_2X_2 we obtain\n\n    2Re(c_1c\u0305_2 \u27e8 X_2, X_1\u27e9_\u03c1_A^2)\u2264  |c_1|^2 (1/\u03b8_1-1) (X_1) + |c_2|^2(1/\u03b8_2-1) (X_2),     \u2200 c_1, c_2.\n\nThis is equivalent to \n\n    [     (1/\u03b8_1-1) (X_1) - \u27e8 X_1, X_2\u27e9_\u03c1_A^2;  -\u27e8 X_2, X_1\u27e9_\u03c1_A^2     (1/\u03b8_2-1) (X_2) ]\u2265 0,\n\nbeing positive semidefinite, that itself is equivalent to \n\n    |\u27e8 X_1, X_2\u27e9_\u03c1_A^2| \u2264\u221a((1/\u03b8_1-1)( 1/\u03b8_2-1) )\u221a((X_1)(X_2)).\n\nTherefore, (\u03b8_1, \u03b8_2)\u2208(A_1, A_2) iff\n\n    max|\u27e8 X_1, X_2\u27e9_\u03c1_A_2|/\u221a((X_1)(X_2))\u2264\u221a((1/\u03b8_1-1)( 1/\u03b8_2-1) ),\n\nwhere the maximum is taken over X_1\u2208_1^0 and X_2\u2208_2^0. We note that by definition the left hand side is equal to \u03bc(A_1, A_2).\n\n\n\nRecall that for |\u03c8\u27e9_A_1A_2 = 1/\u221a(2) (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9) we have \u03bc(A_1, A_2)=1. Thus, by the above theorem, (\u03b8_1, \u03b8_2)\u2208(A_1, A_2) iff (1/\u03b8_1-1)(1/\u03b8_2-1)\u2265 1 that is equivalent to \u03b8_1+\u03b8_2\u2264 1.\nTherefore, the MC\u00a0ribbon for |\u03c8\u27e9_A_1A_2 is the smallest possible set.\n\n\nFor the next result we first need a lemma.\n\n\nLet X, X', Y, Y' be positive semidefinite matrices with the block forms X=(X_ij), X'=(X'_ij), Y=(Y_ij), Y'=(Y'_ij).\nSuppose that X\u2265 Y and X'\u2265 Y', meaning that X-Y and X'-Y' are positive semidefinite. Then,\n\n    X\u22a0 X'\u2265 Y\u22a0 Y',\n\nwhere X\u22a0 X' is a matrix whose ij-th block equals X_ij\u2297 X'_ij, and Y\u22a0 Y' is defined similarly.\n\n\n\nSince X-Y and X'-Y' as well as X', Y are positive semidefinite, (X-Y)\u2297 X' and Y\u2297 (X'-Y') are positive semidefinite. This means that (X-Y)\u2297 X'+Y\u2297 (X'-Y')= X\u2297 X'-Y\u2297 Y' is positive semidefinite. Now, we note that X\u22a0 X'-Y\u22a0 Y' is a principal submatrix of X\u2297 X'-Y\u2297 Y', so is positive semidefinite. \n\n\n\nWe now prove the main properties of the MC\u00a0ribbon, namely the data processing inequality and the tensorization.\n\n\n\n\n\n  * (Data processing) Suppose that \u03a6_A_j\u2192 A'_j is a quantum operator acting on the subsystem A_i. Then for \u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m and \u03c3_A'_1, \u2026, A'_m we have\n\n    (A_1, \u2026, A_m) \u2286(A'_1, \u2026, A'_m).\n\n\n\n  * (Tensorization) For any \u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m, \u03c3_A'_1, \u2026, A'_m we have \n\n    (A_1A'_1, \u2026, A_mA'_m) = (A_1, \u2026, A_m)\u2229(A'_1, \u2026, A'_m),\n\nwhere the left hand side is the MC\u00a0ribbon of the state \u03c1_A_1, \u2026, A_m\u2297\u03c3_A'_1, \u2026, A'_m considered as an m-partite state. \n\n\n\n\n(Data processing) Any quantum operation is a combination of an isometry and a partial trace. Clearly, local isometries do not change the MC\u00a0ribbon. Thus, it suffices to prove data processing under partial traces. To this end, we need to show that for a state \u03c1_A_1B_1, \u2026, A_mB_m we have\n\n    (A_1B_1, \u2026, A_mB_m) \u2286(A_1, \u2026, A_m).\n\nThis inclusion is immediate once we note that in the definition of the MC\u00a0ribbon in\u00a0(<ref>), we may restrict X_A_1B_1, \u2026, A_mB_m to act non-trivially only on the subsystems (A_1, \u2026, A_m).\n\n(Tensorization)\nLet {F_j,k: k=0, 1, \u2026} be orthonormal bases for _A_j with F_j, 0=I_A_j.  We note that {F_j,k: k=1, 2, \u2026} is an orthonormal basis for _A_j^0 = {X\u2208_A_j: \u27e8 I_A_j, X\u27e9_\u03c1_A_j =0}.  \nThen,  the Gram matrix  of the set \u22c3_j {F_j,k: k=1, 2, \u2026} can be decomposed into blocks =(_jj') where the block _jj' consists of the inner products of elements of {F_j,k: k=1, 2, \u2026} and {F_j',k: k=1, 2, \u2026}.\nSimilarly, letting {F'_j,k': k'=0, 1, \u2026} be an orthonormal basis for _A'_j with F_j, 0=I_A'_j, we can consider the associated Gram matrix '=('_jj') as above. \n\nWe note that the space of operators acting on A_jA'_j is equal to _A_jA'_j = _A_j\u2297_A'_j. Then, \n{F_j,k\u2297 F'_j, k': k, k'=0, 1, \u2026} is an orthonormal basis for _A_jA'_j. Moreover, since F_j, 0\u2297 F'_j, 0 = I_A_jA'_j, the set {F_j,k\u2297 F'_j, k': (k, k')\u2260 (0,0) } is an orthonormal basis for ^0_A_jA'_j.\nThus, following Theorem\u00a0<ref>, we need to compute the Gram matrix of the set \u22c3_j {F_j,k\u2297 F'_j, k': (k, k')\u2260 (0,0) }. This set can be decomposed into \u22c3_j {F_j,k\u2297 F'_j, k': (k, k')\u2260 (0,0) } = \u2131\u222a\u2131'\u222a\u2131, where \n\n    \u2131   =  \u22c3_j  {F_j,k\u2297 I_A'_j: k=1, 2,\u2026},\n    \u2131'    =  \u22c3_j {I_A_j\u2297 F'_j, k': k'=1, 2,\u2026},\n    \u2131    = \u22c3_j{F_j,k\u2297 F'_j, k': k, k'=1, 2,\u2026}.\n\nObserve that, first, these three sets are orthogonal to each other. Second, the Gram matrix of \u2131 equals , the Gram matrix of \u22c3_j  {F_j,k: k=1, 2,\u2026}, and similarly the Gram matrix of \u2131' equals '. Third, a straightforward computation shows that the Gram matrix of \u2131 is equal to \u22a0', defined in Lemma\u00a0<ref>. Putting these together, we find that the Gram matrix of the union is given by\n\n    [     0  0;  0  '  0;  0  0 \u22a0' ].\n\nNow, suppose that (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208(A_1, \u2026, A_m)\u222a(A'_1, \u2026, A'_m). Then, by Theorem\u00a0<ref> we have \u0398^-1\u2265 and \u0398'^-1\u2265', where \u0398' is defined similarly to \u0398 but probably with a different size. Thus, by Lemma\u00a0<ref> we have\n\n    [   \u0398^-1      0      0;      0  \u0398'^-1      0;      0      0 \u0398^-1\u22a0' ]\u2265[     0  0;  0  '  0;  0  0 \u22a0' ].\n\nNext, we note that \u0398^-1 is diagonal, so \n\n    \u0398^-1\u22a0' = \u0398^-1\u22a0diag('_11, \u2026, '_mm),\n\nwhere diag('_11, \u2026, '_mm) is a the block-diagonal matrix with blocks '_jj on the diagonal. On other hand, recall that '_jj is the Gram matrix of the set {F'_j, k':  k'=1, 2, \u2026}, that is orthonormal. Thus, '_jj is the identity matrix. Therefore, \n\n    \u0398^-1\u22a0' = \u0398^-1\u22a0diag(I^(1), \u2026, I^(m)),\n \nwhere I^(j) is the identity matrix of an appropriate size. Then,  using Theorem\u00a0<ref>, equation\u00a0(<ref>) implies that (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m) \u2208(A_1A'_1, \u2026, A_mA'_m) and\n\n    (A_1, \u2026, A_m)\u2229(A'_1, \u2026, A'_m)\u2286(A_1A'_1, \u2026, A_mA'_m).\n\nInclusion in the other direction is a consequence of the data processing property proven in the first part. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MAXIMAL CORRELATION RIBBON FOR GAUSSIAN STATES\n\n\nIn this appendix we compute the MC\u00a0ribbon for multipartite Gaussian states. We show that, similar to the bipartite case, in order to compute the MC\u00a0ribbon via\u00a0(<ref>), it suffices to consider only observables X_1, \u2026, X_m that are linear in the position and momentum operators. To prove this result, we follow similar ideas used in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\nLet \u03c1_A^m=\u03c1_A_1,\u2026,A_m be an m-mode Gaussian state. We note that, as is clear from its definition, the MC\u00a0ribbon does not change under local unitaries. Thus, by Theorem\u00a0<ref> we may assume that (\u03c1_A^m)=0 and \n\n    =(\u03c1_A^m) = [ \u03bb_1 I   _12     \u22ef   _1m;   _21 \u03bb_2 I     \u22ef   _2m;     \u22ee     \u22ee     \u22f1     \u22ee;   _m1   _m2     \u22ef \u03bb_m I ],\n\nwhere (\u03c1_A_j) = \u03bb_j I and _jj' =_j'j^\u22a4.\n\n\nLet \u03c1_A^m be an m-mode Gaussian state with first moment (\u03c1^m)=0 and covariance matrix given by\u00a0(<ref>).  Let \n\n    \u039b = diag(\u221a(\u03bb_1+1/2), \u221a(\u03bb_1-1/2), \u2026, \u221a(\u03bb_m+1/2), \u221a(\u03bb_m-1/2)),\n \nand \u03a5_m=\u03a5\u2295\u22ef\u2295\u03a5,\nwhere \u03a5 is given in\u00a0(<ref>). Then, (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208 [0,1]^m belongs to (A_1, \u2026, A_m) if and only if \n\n    1/2\u039b^-1\u03a5\u0305_m ( + i\u03a9_m) \u03a5_m^\u22a4\u039b^-1\u2264\u0398^-1\u2297 I_2,\n\nwhere \u0398= diag(  \u03b8_1,  \u2026, \u03b8_m) and I_2 is the 2\u00d7 2 identity matrix.\nIn particular, to compute the MC\u00a0ribbon of \u03c1_A^m, it suffices to consider X_1, \u2026, X_m in\u00a0(<ref>) that are linear in terms of \nphase-space quadrature operators. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe follow similar steps as in the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>. First, we note that the set {H_k, \u2113^(j):  k, \u2113\u2265 0} defined via\u00a0(<ref>), for \u03bb=\u03bb_j, forms an orthonormal basis for _j, the space of operators acting on A_j. Moreover, we have H_0,0^(j) = I_A_j, so {H_k, \u2113^(j):  (k, \u2113)\u2260 0} is an orthonormal basis for _A_j^0. Thus, to apply Theorem\u00a0<ref> we need to compute the Gram matrix of the set \u22c3_j {H_k, \u2113^(j):  (k, \u2113)\u2260 0}. To this end, we decompose this set in terms of the total degrees:\n\n    \u22c3_j {H_k, \u2113^(j):  (k, \u2113)\u2260 0} = \u22c3_t=1^\u221e(\u22c3_j {H_k, \u2113^(j):  k+\u2113=t}).\n\nWe note that by\u00a0(<ref>), basis operators with different degrees are orthogonal to each other. Then, the associated Gram matrix takes the form \n\n    diag(^(1), ^(2), \u2026),\n \nwhere ^(t) is the Gram matrix of \u22c3_j {H_k, \u2113^(j):  k+\u2113=t}. As computed in\u00a0(<ref>), the inner products of elements of {H_k, \u2113^(j):  k+\u2113=1} and {H_k, \u2113^(j'):  k+\u2113=1} equals\n\n    ^(1)_jj' = 1/2[ \u03b6_0^-1(\u03bb_j)           0;           0 \u03b6_1^-1(\u03bb_j) ]\u03a5\u0305_jj'\u03a5^\u22a4[ \u03b6_0^-1(\u03bb_j')            0;            0 \u03b6_1^-1(\u03bb_j') ],\n\nwhere \u03b6_0(\u03bb), \u03b6_1(\u03bb) are defined in\u00a0(<ref>). On the other hand, a simple computation shows that \n\n    1/2[ \u03b6_0^-1(\u03bb_j)           0;           0 \u03b6_1^-1(\u03bb_j) ]\u03a5\u0305(\u03bb_j I + i\u03a9) \u03a5^\u22a4[ \u03b6_0^-1(\u03bb_j)           0;           0 \u03b6_1^-1(\u03bb_j) ]=I_2,\n\nis the identity matrix, i.e., the Gram matrix of {H_k, \u2113^(j):  k+\u2113=1}. Putting these together, we conclude that  \n\n    ^(1)=1/2\u039b^-1\u03a5\u0305_m ( + i\u03a9_m) \u03a5_m^\u22a4\u039b^-1,\n\nwhich is the left hand side of\u00a0(<ref>). Thus, the statement of the theorem says that (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208(A_1, \u2026, A_m) if and only if\n\n    ^(1)\u2264\u0398^-1\u2297 I_2.\n\nWe note that by Theorem\u00a0<ref>, (\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m)\u2208(A_1, \u2026, A_m) if and only if for any t we have\n\n    ^(t)\u2264\u0398^-1\u2297 I_t+1,\n\nwhere \u0398=diag(\u03b8_1, \u2026, \u03b8_m) and I_t+1 is the (t+1)\u00d7 (t+1) identity matrix. Thus, to prove the theorem we need to show that if the above inequality holds for t=1, then it holds for all t. \nWe note that t=1 corresponds to degree-one basis operators, that are linear in terms of quadrature operators. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet S be the matrix of size (t+1)\u00d7 2^t used in the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref> whose entries are given by\u00a0(<ref>). Also, let \n\n    S_m = S\u2295\u22ef\u2295 S = I_m\u2297 S.\n \nBased on the computations in the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref> we have SS^\u2020=I. Moreover, letting ^(t)_jj' be the jj'-th block of ^(t) that consists of the inner products of elements of {H_k, \u2113^(j):  k+\u2113=t} and {H_k, \u2113^(j'):  k+\u2113=t}, we have S(^(1)_jj')^\u2297 tS^\u2020 = ^(t). Therefore, using the notation of Lemma\u00a0<ref> we have\n\n    S_m (^(1))^\u22a0 t S^\u2020_m = ^(t).\n\nThus, to prove the theorem we need to show that if ^(1)\u2264\u0398^-1\u2297 I_2, then S_m (^(1))^\u22a0 t S^\u2020_m \u2264\u0398^-1\u2297 I_t+1. Starting from ^(1)\u2264\u0398^-1\u2297 I_2 and using Lemma\u00a0<ref> we have\n\n    (^(1))^\u22a0 t\u2264(\u0398^-1\u2297 I_2)\u22a0(^(1))^\u22a0 (t-1) = \u0398^-1\u2297 I_2^\u2297 t,\n\nwhere the equality follows from the fact that \u0398^-1\u2297 I_2 is diagonal and the blocks on the diagonal of (^(1))^\u22a0 (t-1) are equal to I_2^\u2297 (t-1). Next, conjugating both sides with S_m=I_m\u2297 S and using\u00a0(<ref>) yield\n\n    ^(t)\u2264 S_m(\u0398^-1\u2297 I_2^\u2297 t)S_m^\u2020 = (I_m\u2297 S)(\u0398^-1\u2297 I_2^\u2297 t)(I_m \u2297 S^\u2020) = \u0398^-1\u2297 SS^\u2020 =\u0398^-1\u2297 I_t+1,\n\nwhich proves the theorem.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
