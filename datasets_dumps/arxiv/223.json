One application is to triage patients\u2019 radiological medical images based on the algorithm's binary outputs. Such AI-based prioritization software is known as computer-aided triage and notification (CADt). Their main benefit is to speed up radiological review of images with time-sensitive findings. However, as CADt devices become more common in clinical workflows, there is still a lack of quantitative methods to evaluate a device\u2019s effectiveness in saving patients' waiting times. In this paper, we present a mathematical framework based on queueing theory to calculate the average waiting time per patient image before and after a CADt device is used. We study four workflow models with multiple radiologists (servers) and priority classes for a range of AI diagnostic performance, radiologist's reading rates, and patient image (customer) arrival rates. Due to model complexity, an approximation method known as the Recursive Dimensionality Reduction technique is applied. We define a performance metric to measure the device\u2019s time-saving effectiveness. A software tool is developed to simulate clinical workflow of image review/interpretation, to verify theoretical results, and to provide confidence intervals  of the performance metric we defined. It is shown quantitatively that a triage device is more effective in a busy, short-staffed setting, which is consistent with our clinical intuition and simulation results. Although this work is motivated by the need for evaluating CADt devices, the framework we present in this paper can be applied to any algorithm that prioritizes customers based on its binary outputs.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe fast-growing development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies bring a potential to transform healthcare in many ways.\nOne emerging area is the use of AI/ML as Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) in radiological imaging to triage patient images with time-sensitive findings for image interpretation <cit.>.\nThese devices are known as computer-aided triage and notification (CADt) devices, by which medical images labeled as positive by an AI algorithm are prioritized in the radiologist's reading queue.\nThe major benefit of a CADt device is to increase the likelihood of timely diagnosis and treatment of severe and time-critical diseases such as large vessel occlusion (LVO), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), pneumothorax, etc.\nIn 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted marketing authorization to the first CADt device for potential LVO stroke patients via the de novo pathway <cit.>. \nSince then, multiple studies have shown improvements in patient treatment and clinical outcomes due to the use of CADt devices <cit.>.\nMost of these analyses focus on the diagnostic performance when evaluating these CADt devices, but a quantitative estimate of time savings for truly diseased (signal-present) patient images in a clinical environment remain unclear.\nTherefore, the goal of this work is to fill this gap by developing a queueing-theory based tool to characterize the time-saving effectiveness of a CADt device in a given clinical setting.\n\nFigure <ref> illustrates the radiologist workflows without and with a CADt device being used.\nIn the standard of care without a CADt device, patient images are reviewed by a radiologist on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.\nIn the context of queuing theory, our servers are radiologists, and our customers are patient images.\nOccasionally, the radiologist may be interrupted by an emergent case, for example, when a physician requests an immediate review of a specific patient image.\nTo distinguish these emergent cases from those in the reading queue, we call the images in the reading list \u201cnon-emergent.\"\nIf a CADt device is included in the workflow, the device only analyzes non-emergent patient images.\n\nCases labeled as AI-positive are either flagged or moved up in a radiologist's reading list, giving them higher priority, and the radiologist will review those cases before all AI-negative patient images.\nJust like the without-CADt scenario, the radiologist may be interrupted by emergent cases, which always have the highest priority over other images.\nOverall, without a CADt, we have a queue with two priority classes, and we have a queue with three priority classes in a with-CADt scenario.\n\n\n\nIt is noted that, though applied to radiology clinics, the mathematical frameworks presented here could be used to evaluate discrimination algorithms in other queueing contexts.\nFor example, algorithms may attempt to identify customers or jobs who may require less service time and place them into a higher priority class, thereby reducing overall wait time for customers on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PARAMETERS\n\n\n\nBefore applying queueing theory, a few parameters are defined to describe the clinical setting.\n\n  \n  * f_em is the fraction of emergent patient images with respect to all patient images.\n  \n  * \u03bb is the Poisson arrival rate of all patient images.\n  Patient images can be divided into subgroups, and each subgroup i has a Poisson arrival rate \u03bb_i = p_i\u03bb, where p_i is the fraction of image subgroup i with respect to all patient images.\n  \n  * The disease prevalence \u03c0 is defined within the non-emergent patient population, i.e.\n  \n    \u03c0 = Number of diseased, non-emergent cases/Number of non-emergent cases.\n\n  \n  * CADt diagnostic performance is defined by its sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp), which are also defined within the non-emergent patient images i.e.\n  \n    Se = 0.85Number of AI-positive, diseased, non-emergent cases/Number of diseased, non-emergent cases,\n\n  and\n  \n    0.85Sp = Number of AI-negative, non-diseased, non-emergent cases/Number of non-diseased, non-emergent cases.\n\n  \n  * N_rad is the number of radiologists on-site.\n  Typically, a clinic has at least one radiologist at all times. \n  For a larger hospital, multiple radiologists may be available during the day.\n  \n  * The radiologist's reading rates are denoted by \u03bc's.\n  For emergent (highest-priority) cases, the reading time T_em is assumed to be exponentially distributed with an average reading rate \u03bc_em=1/T_em.\n  For a non-emergent image, the average reading rate depends on the radiologist's diagnosis i.e. \u03bc_D if diseased image or \u03bc_ND if non-diseased image.\n  Therefore, in the without-CADt scenario, the reading time of the non-emergent (lower-priority) cases follows a hyperexponential distribution where the mean (1/\u03bc_nonEm) is determined by the mean reading rates of the two subgroups and the probability of disease prevalence \u03c0.\n  \n    1/\u03bc_nonEm = \u03c0/\u03bc_D + 1-\u03c0/\u03bc_ND.\n\n  In the with-CADt scenario, the average reading rates for AI-positive (middle-priority) and AI-negative (lowest-priority) classes are denoted by \u03bc_+ and \u03bc_- respectively.\n  The AI-positive group consists of true-positive (TP) and false-positive (FP) patients, and the probability that an AI-positive case is a TP is defined by the positive predictive value (PPV).\n  Hence, \n  \n    1/\u03bc_+ = PPV/\u03bc_D + 1-PPV/\u03bc_ND.\n  \n  Similarly, the average AI-negative reading rate is given by\n  \n    1/\u03bc_- = 1-NPV/\u03bc_D + NPV/\u03bc_ND,\n  \n  where NPV is the probability that an AI-negative case is a true-negative (TN).\n  \n  * \u03c1 is the traffic intensity defined as \u03c1 = \u03bb/\u03bc_eff, where  \u03bc_eff is effective reading rate considering all priority classes and N_rad in the queueing system.\n  \u03c1 ranges from 0 with no patient images arriving to 1 implying a very congested hospital.\n  \n  * With regard to the queueing discipline, when no CADt device is used, patient images are read in the order of their arrival time i.e. first-in first-out (FIFO).\n  In the with-CADt scenario, we consider a preemptive-resume priority scheduling:\n  whether or not a CADt device is used, whenever a higher-priority patient image enters the system, the reading of a lower-priority patient image will be interrupted and later resumed.\n  Although in reality some radiologists may prefer finishing up the current lower-priority image when a CADt device flags a higher-priority case (which would be a non-preemptive-resume priority), many CADt devices are designed assuming a radiologist reads the flagged cases immediately.\n  Therefore, a preemptive-resume priority is assumed in this work.\n\n\nTo assess the time-saving effectiveness of a given CADt device in a clinical setting defined by the above parameters, we first define four radiologist workflow models in Section <ref>. \nFor each of the models, we provide the Markov chain matrices to compute the mean waiting time for each priority class in both with- and without-CADt scenarios.\nSection <ref> discusses an in-house simulation software developed to verify theoretical results and to provide confidence intervals around the theoretical mean time savings.\nSection <ref> defines a metric that quantifies the time-saving effectiveness of a CADt device, and Section <ref> discusses the results obtained from theory and simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RADIOLOGIST WORKFLOW MODELS\n\n\n\nWe consider four radiologist workflow models:\n\n    \n  * Model A: The baseline model (N_rad = 1, f_em = 0, and \u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND)\n    \n  * Model B: Model A but with emergent patient images (N_rad = 1, f_em > 0, and \u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND)\n    \n  * Model C: Model B but with two radiologists  (N_rad = 2, f_em > 0, and \u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND)\n    \n  * Model D: Model B but with different reading rates for diseased and non-diseased images (N_rad = 1, f_em > 0, and \u03bc_D \u2260\u03bc_ND)\n\n\nFor each model, two calculations are performed: one assumes a without-CADt scenario, and the other assumes the use of a CADt device.\nEach scenario has a set of states that keeps track of the numbers of patient images in different priority classes.\nThe transition rates among states form a stochastic Markov chain matrix, from which the matrix geometric method is applied to calculate the set of state probabilities <cit.> .\nFor models involving multiple radiologists and priority classes, we apply the Recursive Dimensionality Reduction (RDR) method proposed by <cit.> to facilitate the calculation.\nLittle's Law <cit.> is then applied to calculate the mean waiting time per patient image for each priority class involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Model A: Baseline model\n\n\nWe start with a simple model with the absence of emergent patient images (f_em = 0), one radiologist on-site (N_rad = 1), and identical reading rates for diseased and non-diseased subgroups (\u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND).\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Model A in without-CADt scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we consider the without-CADt scenario.\nGiven that f_em = 0, only one priority class (the non-emergent subgroup) exists, and the arrival rate \u03bb is the arrival rate of non-emergent patient images \u03bb_nonEm.\nWhen \u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND and with only 1 radiologist on-site, the effective reading rate for the non-emergent subgroup is \u03bc_nonEm = \u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND.\nHence, Model A turns into a classic M/M/1/FIFO queueing model <cit.>.\nIts transition diagram is shown in Figure <ref>, from which the state probability p_n is given by\n\n    p_n_nonEm = \u03c1_nonEm^n (1-\u03c1_nonEm),\n\nwhere n_nonEm denotes the number of non-emergent patient image in the system.\nFrom the state probability p_n_nonEm, the average waiting time per non-emergent patient image can be calculated by the following steps.\n\n  \n  * Calculate the average number of non-emergent patient images in the system, L, from the state probability p_n_nonEm. That is, L =\u27e8 p_n_nonEm\u27e9, where \u27e8\u27e9 is the expectation operator.\n  \n  * Calculate the average response time per non-emergent patient image, W, via Little's Law i.e. W = L/\u03bb_nonEm.\n  \n  * Calculate the average waiting time in the queue per non-emergent patient, W_q_nonEm.\n  Because W is the sum of W_q_nonEm and the mean radiologist's reading time T=1/\u03bc_nonEm, we have W_q_nonEm  = W - 1/\u03bc_nonEm.\n\nIn summary, the average waiting time per non-emergent patient image W_q_nonEm in a without-CADt scenario is given by\n\n    W_q_nonEm = \u27e8 p_n_nonEm\u27e9/\u03bb_nonEm - 1/\u03bc_nonEm.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Model A in with-CADt scenario\n\n\n\nWhen a CADt-device is used with no emergent patient images (f_em = 0), two priority classes exist: an AI-positive, higher-priority class and an AI-negative, lower-priority class.\nThe arrival rates of AI-positive and AI-negative classes depend on the CADt diagnostic performance.\n\n    \u03bb_+ = [\u03c0Se + (1-\u03c0)(1-Sp) ]\u03bb,\n\n\n    \u03bb_- = [\u03c0(1-Se) + (1-\u03c0)Sp]\u03bb.\n\nThe state of a two-priority class system is defined by the number of AI-positive cases n_+ and that of AI-negative n_-.\nAs shown in Figure <ref>, the exact transition diagram is infinite in both horizontal (n_-) and vertical (n_+) directions.\nWith an assumed preemptive-resume priority scheduling, this 2D-infinity problem can be resolved using the Recursive Dimensionality Reduction (RDR) method <cit.>, in which the tangled two-priority-class system is broken down into two independent calculations, one for each priority class.\n\n\n\nFirst, we focus on the AI-positive, higher-priority system.\nBecause of the preemptive-resume queueing discipline, the AI-positive subgroup is not affected by the AI-negative images at all and is, by itself, a classic M/M/1/FIFO queueing model.\nTherefore, to solve for the average waiting time per AI-positive patient image, one can reuse Figure <ref> and replace n_nonEm by n_+.\nThe state probability for AI-positive patient images is modified based on Equation <ref>; \n\n    p_n_+ = \u03c1_+^n_+ (1-\u03c1_+),\n\nwhere \u03c1_+ \u2261\u03bb_+/\u03bc_+ is the traffic intensity for the AI-positive subgroup only.\nFollowing the steps in Equation <ref>, the average waiting time per AI-positive patient image W_q_+ is given by\n\n    W_q_+ = \u27e8 p_n_+\u27e9/\u03bb_+ - 1/\u03bc_+.\n\n\nFor the calculation of the AI-negative, lower-priority class, we cannot ignore the presence of AI-positive cases.\nHowever, with only one radiologist, no AI-negative patient image can exit the system when n_+ \u2265 1.\nAs noted by <cit.>, there is no need to keep track of every state beyond n_+ \u2265 1.\nHence, every column in Figure <ref> can be truncated such that all states beyond n_+ \u2265 1 are represented by (1^+, n_-).\nThe RDR-truncated transition diagram is shown in Figure <ref>.\n\n\n\nBecause of the truncation, the transition rate B from (1_+, n_-) to (0, n_-) no longer represents a simple exponential transition time distribution.\nIn fact, the shape of this transition time distribution is often unknown but can be approximated to an Erlang-Coxian (EC) distribution.\nAs shown in Figure <ref>, a general EC distribution consists of exactly two Coxian phases and N__EC-2 Erlang phases.\nFor a given distribution of unknown shape, <cit.> provided closed-form solutions to calculate the first three moments of the unknown distribution and the six parameters in the EC distribution that best matches the first three moments. \n\n\n\nWhen applying the EC-approximation method to the RDR-truncated transition diagram in Figure <ref>, only the two-phase Coxian distribution is sufficient.\nNo Erlang phases are needed; hence, p__EC, N__EC, and \u03bb_Y_EC in Figure <ref> are 1, 2, and 0 respectively.\nThe non-exponential transition B can then be explicitly expressed in terms of the approximated exponential transition rates t's as shown in Figure <ref>, where\n\n    t_1     = (1-p_X_EC)\u03bb_X1_EC; \n    t_12 = p_X_EC\u03bb_X1_EC; \n    t_2 = \u03bb_X2_EC.\n\n\n\n\nFigure <ref> is a typical Markov chain transition diagram, and its transition rate matrix M_A can be formed (see Section <ref> in Electronic Companions).\nUsing the matrix geometric method, an analysis method for quasi-birth\u2013death processes where the Markov chain matrix has a repetitive block structure <cit.>, the state probability p_n_- is computed.\nHence, the average waiting time per AI-negative, low-priority patient image, W_q_-, can be calculated;\n\n    W_q_- = \u27e8 p_n_-\u27e9/\u03bb_- - 1/\u03bc_-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Model B: Model A with emergent patient images\n\n\n\nModel B is similar to Model A but with the presence of emergent patient images (f_em > 0).\nThese emergent images are prioritized to the highest priority regardless of the presence of CADt devices.\nAlthough the waiting time of the emergent subgroup can be studied, this work only focuses on the non-emergent, AI-positive, and AI-negative subgroups which are impacted by the CADt device.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Model B in without-CADt scenario\n\n\n\nIn the standard of care without a CADt device, the presence of emergent class results in a two-priority-class queueing system: emergent and non-emergent classes.\nFor the emergent subgroup, \u03bc_em denotes its radiologist's reading rate, and its arrival rate is given by\n\n    \u03bb_em = f_em\u03bb.\n\nThe arrival rate for the non-emergent class is \n\n    \u03bb_nonEm = (1-f_em)\u03bb.\n\nSimilar to Model A, because \u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND and N_rad = 1, the effective reading rate for the non-emergent subgroup is \u03bc_nonEm =\u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND.\n\nWith only one radiologist on-site, the analysis of non-emergent, lower-priority class is exactly the same as that of the AI-negative class in Model A in the with-CADt scenario.\nFigure <ref> (and Equation <ref> in Electronic Companions) can be reused by replacing \u03bb_+ with \u03bb_em, \u03bb_- with \u03bb_nonEm, \u03bc_+ with \u03bc_em, and \u03bc_- with \u03bc_nonEm.\nAfter solving for the state probability p_n_nonEm, the average waiting time per non-emergent patient image is given by Equation <ref>.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Model B in with-CADt scenario\n\n\n\nWhen a CADt is included in the workflow, three priority classes exist: emergent (highest priority), AI-positive (middle priority), and AI-negative (lowest priority) classes.\nWith the presence of emergent patients, the arrival rates of AI-positive and AI-negative classes are now\n\n    \u03bb_+ = [\u03c0Se + (1-\u03c0)(1-Sp) ](1-f_em)\u03bb, and\n\n\n    \u03bb_- = [\u03c0(1-Se) + (1-\u03c0)Sp](1-f_em)\u03bb.\n\nTheir reading rates are given by Equations <ref> and <ref>.\nHowever, because \u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND, the reading rates for the AI-positive and AI-negative subgroups are the same; \u03bc_+ = \u03bc_- = \u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND.\nSimilar to Model A in with-CADt scenario, we apply the RDR method and solve for the AI-positive and AI-negative systems separately.\n\nFor the AI-positive subgroup, it is noted that an AI-positive patient image can only be interrupted by emergent patient images and will not be impacted by any AI-negative patient images.\nTherefore, the emergent and AI-positive subgroups form a two-priority-class queueing system which can be solved using the framework developed for the non-emergent subgroup in the without-CADt scenario.\nFigure <ref> (and Equation <ref> in Electronic Companions) can be reused by replacing \u03bb_+ with \u03bb_em, \u03bb_- with \u03bb_+, \u03bc_+ with \u03bc_em, and \u03bc_- with \u03bc_+.\nThe state probability p_n_+ for the AI-positive subgroup is calculated, from which the average waiting time per AI-positive patient image is given by Equation <ref>.\n\nThe calculation for the AI-negative, lowest-priority subgroup involves states (n_em, n_+, n_-) defined by the number of emergent, AI-positive, and AI-negative patient images in the system.\nAn AI-negative patient image can be interrupted by either an emergent or an AI-positive patient image.\nThe arrival time of the interrupting case denotes the start of a busy period, which is defined as the time period during which a radiologist is too busy for AI-negative cases.\nWhile the radiologist is reading the interrupting case, new emergent and/or AI positive images may enter the system, which further delays the review of the interrupted AI-negative case.\nOnce all the higher-priority images are reviewed, the radiologist then resumes the reading of the interrupted AI-negative patient image, and the busy period ends.\n\n\n\nDue to the different arrival and reading rates between the emergent and AI-positive patient images, the dependence of AI-negative busy period on the two subgroups are different.\nAs <cit.> discussed, one must keep track of the state at which the busy period starts and the state at which the busy period ends.\nWith only one radiologist, Model B has only two distinct busy periods:\n\n    \n  * B_1: (0, 1^+, n_-) \u2192 (0, 0, n_-)\n    \n  * B_2: (1^+, 0, n_-) \u2192 (0, 0, n_-)\n\nHere, B_1 and B_2 are the rates of the two busy periods and are explicitly shown as two non-exponential transitions in Figure <ref>.\n\nJust like the AI-negative system in Model A, one must first calculate the first three moments for each busy period and approximate each distribution using a two-phase Coxian distribution.\nWith three priority classes and two busy periods, the approximation involves the inter-level passage times from the AI-positive transition diagram, from which a transition probability matrix as well as the transition rate matrix are determined (see M_B in Section <ref>).\nFrom transition rate matrix, the state probability p_n_- can be solved via conventional matrix geometric method.\nOnce p_n_- is determined, the average waiting time per AI-negative patient image W_q_- can be calculated via Equation <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Model C: Model B with two radiologists\n\n\n\nModel C extends Model B by adding one extra radiologist on-site N_rad = 2.\nThe arrival rates for the emergent, non-emergent, AI-positive, and AI-negative classes remain the same (Equations <ref> - <ref>).\nBecause \u03bc_D = \u03bc_ND, the reading rates for the non-emergent, AI-positive, and AI-negative subgroups are the same; \u03bc_+ = \u03bc_- = \u03bc_nonEm.\nBecause of the extra radiologist, the traffic intensity \u03c1 has a factor of two; \u03c1=\u03bb/2\u03bc.\nIt should be noted that Model C has the same settings as the example in <cit.>.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Model C in without-CADt scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nWith no CADt devices, the RDR-truncated transition diagram for the non-emergent, lower-priority class is given by Figure <ref>.\nGiven two radiologists on-site, a non-emergent image can depart the system only when n_em < 2, and hence the truncation of states starts when n_em = 2.\nMoreover, when n_em = 0, both radiologists are available for non-emergent patient images.\nThus, the first row has a leaving rate 2\u03bc_nonEm, except the transition from (0, 1) to (0, 0) when only one radiologist has work to do.\nWhen n_em = 1 (the second row), only one of the two radiologists is available to review a non-emergent case, resulting in a leaving rate of 1\u03bc_nonEm.\nWhen n_em\u2265 2, both radiologists are busy handling emergent cases.\nSince no radiologist is available for non-emergent images, their leaving rate is 0, and no non-emergent images can leave the system.\nTo approximate the transition rate B in Figure <ref>, the same two-phase Coxian approximation described in Models A and B is applied.\n\nThe transition rate matrix M_C_noCADt for Figure <ref> can be found in Section <ref>.\nFrom M_C_noCADt, the state probability p_n_nonEm is determined, and the average waiting time per non-emergent patient image is given by Equation <ref>.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Model C in with-CADt scenario\n\n\n\nIn the with-CADt scenario, the calculations for AI-positive (middle-priority) and AI-negative (lowest-priority) subgroups are separated.\n\nThe queueing system for the AI-positive subgroup consists of two priority classes: the emergent and AI-positive classes, and the framework developed for the non-emergent subgroup in the without-CADt scenario can be reused.\nBy replacing \u03bb_nonEm with \u03bb_+ and \u03bc_nonEm with \u03bc_+ in Figure <ref> and Equation <ref>, the state probability for the AI-positive subgroup p_n_+ can be computed.\nAnd the average waiting time per AI-positive patient image W_q_+ is given by Equation <ref>.\n\n\n\nThe approach to analyze the AI-negative, lowest-priority subgroup is similar to the analysis of the AI-negative cases in Model B.\nRecall that a state is defined as (n_em, n_+, n_-) and that a busy period is defined by the time duration in which all the radiologists on-site are too busy for AI-negative patient images.\nWith two radiologists, a busy period may start from one of the three situations: when there are two emergent cases, when there are one emergent and one AI-positive case, or when there are two AI-positive cases.\nOn the other hand, the busy period ends when one radiologist is handling either an emergent case or an AI-positive case such that the other radiologist is available for the AI-negative case.\nTherefore, instead of two busy periods in Model B, adding one extra radiologist increases the total number of busy periods to six:\n\n    \n  * B_1: (0, 2^+, n_-) \u2192 (0, 1^+, n_-)\n    \n  * B_2: (0, 2^+, n_-) \u2192 (1^+, 0, n_-)\n    \n  * B_3: (1^+, 1^+, n_-) \u2192 (0, 1^+, n_-)\n    \n  * B_4: (1^+, 1^+, n_-) \u2192 (1^+, 0, n_-)\n    \n  * B_5: (2^+, 0, n_-) \u2192 (0, 1^+, n_-)\n    \n  * B_6: (2^+, 0, n_-) \u2192 (1^+, 0, n_-)\n\n\nFigure <ref> shows the RDR-truncated transition diagram for AI-negative subgroup.\nNote that states (0, 2^+, n_-), (1^+, 1^+, n_-), and (2^+, 0, n_-) are duplicated because their corresponding arrival rates also depends on the probabilities that the busy period ends at a particular state i.e. either (0, 1^+, n_-) or (1^+, 0, n_-). \nFor example, p_1 denotes the conditional probability that the busy period ends at (0, 1^+, n_-) given that it starts at (0, 2^+, n_-).\n\nBefore solving for Figure <ref>, one must compute the conditional probability and the first three moments of each busy period, from which the transition rates can be approximated.\nThe calculation is discussed in Section <ref>, where the AI-positive transition diagram for inter-level passage times is presented, and the transition probability matrix is constructed.\n\nEach busy period is approximated using the EC distribution (Figure <ref>).\nHowever, unlike Model B in which two-phase Coxian is sufficient for all busy periods, B_2 and B_5 in Model C require an extra Erlang phase, as shown in Figure <ref>.\nWith an extra phase, two extra parameters t_0 and t_01 are needed to approximate B_2 and B_5.\n\n    t_0     = (1-p__EC)\u03bb_Y_EC; \n    t_01 = p__EC\u03bb_Y_EC; \n    \n    t_1     = (1-p_X_EC)\u03bb_X1_EC;  \n    t_12 = p_X_EC\u03bb_X1_EC; \n    t_2 = \u03bb_X2.\n\n\n\n\nOnce all six busy periods are approximated, the transition rate matrix for the AI-negative, lowest-priority class can be constructed from Figure <ref>. (See Section <ref>.)\nLike before, the corresponding state probability p_n_- can be solved by the matrix geometric method.\nAnd, the average waiting time per AI-negative patient image W_q_- can be calculated via Equation <ref>.\n\nFor N_rad\u2265 3, the same approach can be applied.\nHowever, as the number of busy periods increases, the transition rate matrix will grow in size drastically, especially when more Erlang phases are required for the busy period approximation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Model D: Model B with different reading rates\n\n\nModel D extends Model B by differentiating the radiologist's reading rate between the diseased and non-diseased subgroups (N_rad = 1, f_em > 0, and \u03bc_D \u2260\u03bc_ND).\nThe arrival rates for the emergent, non-emergent, AI-positive, and AI-negative classes remain the same (Equations <ref> - <ref>).\nHowever, because \u03bc_D \u2260\u03bc_ND, the reading rates for non-emergent, AI-positive, and AI-negative subgroups depend on disease prevalence \u03c0, positive predictive value PPV, and negative predictive value NPV (Equations <ref>-<ref>).\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Model D in without-CADt scenario\n\n\n\n  \n\nThe without-CADt scenario has two priority classes: emergent and non-emergent patient images.\nWithin the non-emergent class, two groups of patient images (diseased and non-diseased) are reviewed in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis.\nThe corresponding transition diagram is shown in Figure <ref>.\nAs usual, the state keeps track of n_em and n_nonEm.\nIn addition, because of the different reading rates between the diseased and non-diseased subgroups, the state must also keep track of the disease status of the image that the radiologist is reviewing.\nTherefore, the state is defined as (n_em, n_nonEm, i), where i is either D (i.e. the radiologist is working on a diseased image) or ND (i.e. the radiologist is working on a non-diseased image).\nFurthermore, one must pay attention to how the busy period starts and ends.\nFor example, if the radiologist reading a diseased image is interrupted by the arrival of an emergent image i.e. (0, n, D) \u2192 (1^+, n, D), the state must go back to (0, n, D) and not to (0, n, ND) when the busy period is over.\nThis property is guaranteed by having two sets of truncated states: (1^+, n)_\u2192 D that can only interact with (0, n, D) and (1^+, n)_\u2192 ND that can only interact with (0, n, ND).\n\nThe corresponding transition rate matrix of Figure <ref> is given in Section <ref>. \nNote that, although Figure <ref> has two busy periods per column (one for \u201c\u2192 D\u201d and the other for \u201c\u2192 ND\u201d), they both describe the same transition time when at least one emergent image is in the system.\nTherefore, only one unique set of t-parameters is calculated to approximate both busy periods.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Model D in with-CADt scenario\n\n\n\nThe calculation for AI-positive (middle-priority) and AI-negative (lowest-priority) subgroups are separated. \n\nBecause AI-positive patient images are not impacted by AI-negative cases, the emergent and AI-positive subgroups form a two-priority-class queueing system.\nThe transition rate matrix M_D_noCADt from Figure <ref> can be reused to analyze the queueing of AI-positive patient images.\nBy replacing \u03bb_nonEm by \u03bb_+ (Equation <ref>), \u03bc_nonEm by \u03bc_+ (Equation <ref>), and \u03c0 by PPV, the state probability for the AI-positive subgroup p_n_+ is calculated via standard matrix geometric method.\nThe average waiting time per AI-positive patient image W_q_+ is then given by Equation <ref>.\n\n  \n\nFor the AI-negative, lowest-priority class, the full definition of state (n_em, n_+, i, n_-, j).\ni is either D or ND, indicating whether the radiologist is working on a diseased, AI-positive case or a non-diseased, AI-positive case respectively.\nThe disease status of an AI-negative case that the radiologist is reading is represented by the j which is either D or ND.\nBecause we only have one radiologist, i and j cannot appear simultaneously; the one radiologist can only handle an AI-positive or AI-negative case but not both at the same time.\n\nFigure <ref> shows the RDR-truncated transition diagram for the AI-negative subgroup.\nThere are three unique busy periods with the corresponding transition rates B_i:\n\n    \n  * B_1: (1^+, 0, n_-) \u2192 (0, 0, n_-, j)\n    \n  * B_2: (0, 1^+, D, n_-) \u2192 (0, 0, n_-, j)\n    \n  * B_3: (0, 1^+, ND, n_-) \u2192 (0, 0, n_-, j)\n\nFor each busy period, the truncated state is duplicated with either \u201c\u2192 D\" or \u201c\u2192 ND\" such that the system can return to the state with the correct disease status j when the busy period is over.\n\nLike before, for each unique busy period, its conditional probability and first three moments are determined from the transition probability matrix (see Section <ref>).\nAnd, each unique busy period has a set of t-parameters (Equation <ref>) approximated from a two-phase Coxian distribution.\nWith the approximated busy period transitions, a transition rate matrix can be constructed for the AI-negative subgroup from Figure <ref> (see Section <ref>).\nThe state probability p_n_- is then solved, and the average waiting time per AI-negative patient image W_q_- can be calculated via Equation <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SIMULATION\n\n\n\nTo verify the analytical results from our theoretical queueing approach, a Monte Carlo software was developed using Python to simulate the flow of patient images in a clinic with and without a CADt device.\nA workflow model is defined by a set of input parameters {f_em, \u03c0, \u03c1, \u03bc, N_rad, Se, and Sp}.\n\nDuring the simulation, a new patient image entry is randomly generated with a timestamp that follows a Poisson distribution at an overall arrival rate of \u03bb, which is computed from the user-inputs (traffic \u03c1 and radiologist's reading rates \u03bc).\nEach patient image is randomly assigned with an emergency status (emergent or non-emergent) based on the input emergency fraction f_em.\nIf the patient image is emergent, a reading time is randomly generated from an exponential distribution with a reading rate of \u03bc_em.\nIf the patient image is non-emergent, a disease status (diseased or non-diseased) is randomly assigned based on the input disease prevalence \u03c0.\nThe reading time for this non-emergent patient image is also randomly drawn from an exponential distribution with a reading rate of either \u03bc_D if it is diseased or \u03bc_ND if it is non-diseased.\nEach non-emergent patient image is also assigned with an AI-call status (positive or negative) based on its disease status and the input AI accuracy (Se and Sp).\nThe patient image is then simultaneously placed into two worlds: one with a CADt device and one without.\n\nIn a without-CADt world, the incoming patient image is either a higher-priority case (if it is emergent) or a lower-priority case (if non-emergent).\nIf the patient image is emergent, the case is prioritized over all non-emergent patient images in the system and is placed at the end of the emergent-only queue.\nOtherwise, the patient image is non-emergent and is placed at the end of the current reading queue.\nIn time, when its turn comes, this patient image is read by one of the radiologists and is then removed from the queue.\nTwo pieces of information are recorded for this simulated patient image.\nOne is its waiting time defined as the difference between the time when the image enters the queue and when it leaves the queue.\nIn addition, the number of emergent and non-emergent patient images in the queue right before the arrival of the new patient image are also recorded to study the state probability distribution.\n\nAlternatively, this very same patient image is placed in the with-CADt world.\nThis image has either a high priority (if emergent), a middle priority (if AI-positive), or a low priority (if AI-negative).\nIf the patient image is emergent, the case is prioritized over all AI-positive and AI-negative patient images in the system and is placed at the end of the emergent-only queue.\nIf the patient image is AI-positive, the case is prioritized over all AI-negative images and is placed at the end of the queue consisting of only emergent and AI-positive patient images.\nOtherwise, the patient image is AI-negative and is placed at the end of the current reading queue.\nThe reading time for this patient image in the with-CADt world is identical to its reading time in the without-CADt world.\nHowever, due to the re-ordering by the CADt device, its waiting time in the with-CADt world may be different from that in the without-CADt world.\nFor every patient image, the difference between the two waiting times in the two worlds can be calculated to determine whether the use of the CADt device results in a time-saving or time delay for this image.\nIn addition to its waiting time, the number of emergent, AI-positive, and AI-negative patient images right before the arrival of the new patient image are also recorded.\n\nTo simulate a big enough sample size, a full simulation includes 200 simulations, each of which contains roughly 2,000 patients.\nFrom all simulations, the waiting times from all diseased patient images are histogrammed from which the mean value and the 95% confidence intervals are determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 TIME-SAVING EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION METRIC\n\n\n\nWe define a metric to quantitatively assess the time-saving effectiveness of a given CADt device.\nBoth theoretical and simulation approaches output the mean waiting time per diseased patient image W_D in both with- and without-CADt scenarios.\n\nWithout a CADt device, since the arrival process is random, the average waiting time per non-emergent patient image W^no-CADt_nonEm is the same as W^no-CADt_D i.e. \n\n    W^no-CADt_D = W^no-CADt_nonEm = W_q_nonEm.\n\nWhen a CADt device is included in the workflow, the average waiting time per diseased and non-diseased patient images are no longer the same because the diseased images are more likely to be prioritized by the CADt. \nTo calculate W^CADt_D, we first compute the average waiting time per AI-positive (W^CADt_+ = W_q_+) and per AI-negative (W^CADt_- = W_q_-) patient image based on the mathematical frameworks discussed in Section <ref>.\nBy definition, the average waiting time for the diseased subgroup W^CADt_D is \n\n    W^CADt_D\u2261Total waiting time from all diseased patient images/Number of diseased patient images.\n\nNote that the total waiting time from all diseased patients is the sum of the total waiting time from the true-positive (TP) subgroup and that from the false-negative (FN) subgroup.\nLet N_TP, N_FN, and N_D be the number of TP patient images, that of FN patient images, and that of diseased images.\nW^CADt_D can be rewritten as\n\n    W^CADt_D = W^CADt_+\u00d7 N_TP + W^CADt_-\u00d7 N_FN/N_D.\n\nBecause N_TP/N_D and N_FN/N_D are, by definition, Se and 1-Se, we have\n\n    W^CADt_D = W^CADt_+\u00d7Se + W^CADt_-\u00d7 (1-Se).\n    \n\nTo quantify the time-saving effectiveness of a CADt device for diseased patient images, we define a time performance metric \u03b4 W_D as the difference in mean waiting time per diseased image in the with-CADt and that in the without-CADt scenario:\n\n    \u03b4 W_D\u2261 W^CADt_D - W^no-CADt_D.\n\nIt should be noted that, besides the explicit dependence on AI sensitivity in Equation <ref>, \u03b4 W_D also depends on AI specificity and all the clinical factors in the calculation of W^CADt_+, W^CADt_-, and W^no-CADt_nonEm.\n\nBased on its definition, a negative \u03b4 W_D implies that, on average, a diseased patient image is reviewed earlier when the CADt device is included in the workflow than when it is not.\nThe more negative \u03b4 W_D is, the more time is saved, and the more effective the CADt device is.\nIf \u03b4 W_D = 0, the presence of CADt device does not bring any benefit for the diseased patient images.\nIf \u03b4 W_D is positive, the review of a diseased patient image is delayed on average, and the CADt device brings more risks than benefits to the diseased subgroup.\n\nIt should also be noted that the amount of time savings for other subgroups can be defined similarly.\nFor example, for the non-diseased subgroup, the average waiting time per non-diseased patient image in the without-CADt scenario, W^no-CADt_ND, is \n\n    W^no-CADt_ND = W^no-CADt_nonEm.\n\nWhen the CADt device is included in the workflow, the average waiting time per non-diseased patient image, W^CADt_ND, becomes \n\n    W^CADt_ND = W^CADt_+\u00d7 (1-Sp) + W^CADt_-\u00d7Sp,\n\nwhere the first and second terms correspond to the false-positive and true-negative subgroups respectively.\n\u03b4 W_ND can then be defined to describe the average wait-time difference between the with-CADt and without-CADt scenarios for the non-diseased subgroup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n\n\nTop plot in Figure <ref> shows the time saved per diseased patient images as a function of traffic intensity \u03c1 for one and two radiologists on-site without any emergent patient images.\nAssuming a disease prevalence \u03c0 of 10%, an AI sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 89%, an average image reading time of 10 minutes for both diseased and non-diseased subgroups, and one radiologist on-site, the time saving is significantly improved from about 2 minutes in a quiet, low-volume clinic (radiology traffic intensity of 0.3) to about an hour in a relatively busy clinic (radiology traffic intensity of 0.8).\nAt a traffic intensity \u03c1 of 0.8, the impact due to disease prevalence is found to be small (see middle plot in Figure <ref>).\nOverall, the time-saving effectiveness of the device is also found to be more evident with only one radiologist on-site compared to two.\nBottom plot in Figure <ref> shows the impact on the time-saving effectiveness due to the presence of emergent patient images with the highest priority that overrides any AI prioritization.\nThe amount of time saved per diseased image without any emergent patients (f_em = 0) is more-or-less the same as that with f_em = 50%.\nThis is likely because the amount of delay caused by emergent patient images in a without-CADt scenario is similar to that in the with-CADt scenario.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nThe effect of having different radiologist's reading rates for diseased and non-diseased subgroups are shown in Figure <ref>.\nThe overall dependence on traffic intensity, disease prevalence, and emergency fraction is similar to that in Figure <ref>.\nHowever, more time is saved for diseased patient images when \u03bc_D < \u03bc_ND i.e. when a radiologist takes more time on average to read a non-diseased image than a diseased image.\n\nFor the purpose of evaluating a CADt device, we propose a summary plot as shown in Figure <ref> based on Model B, describing both the diagnostic and time-saving effectiveness of a CADt device.\nThis plot is built upon a traditional receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis <cit.>, in which the ROC curve characterizes the diagnostic performance of the CADt device.\nFor a given radiologist workflow defined by a set of parameters, every point of False-Positive Rate (FPR) and True-Positive Rate (TPR) in the ROC space has an expected mean time savings per diseased patient image, \u03b4 W_D, which is presented by the color map.\nThe device diagnostic performance is near ideal in the top left corner of the ROC space, where \u03b4 W_D is the most negative.\n\n  \n\nTo show the time-saving effectiveness of a CADt device, \u03b4 W_D along the ROC curve is plotted as a function of FPR (top) and TPR (left).\nAt (FPR, TPR) = (0, 0), \u03b4 W_D is 0 minute because all images are classified as AI-negative i.e. no images are prioritized.\nAs both FPR and TPR increase along the ROC curve, the amount of time savings |\u03b4 W_D| increases since most AI-positive cases are truly diseased patient images.\nAs FPR and TPR continue to increase, the number of false-positive cases becomes dominant, reducing the device\u2019s time-saving effectiveness.\nWhen (FPR, TPR) = (1, 1), \u03b4 W_D goes back to 0 because all images are classified as AI-positive, and the system essentially has no priority classes. \n\nThe mean time-savings for diseased patient images \u03b4 W_D can be directly linked to potential patient outcome.\nFor example, if our disease of interest is large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke, \u03b4 W_D color axis on the right side of Figure <ref> can be translated to three stroke patient outcome metrics.\nAccording to Table 12 in Supplementary Content (Supplementary 2) of <cit.>, for every 15 minutes sooner that a patient is treated, 3.9% of stroke patients resulted in less disability.\nThis can be translated to the two other common LVO stroke patient outcome metrics - the number of patients needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) and the number of minutes faster needed to treat (MNT).\nThe relationships between \u03b4 W_D and LVO stroke patient outcome metrics are extrapolated linearly and shown in the three axes on the right side of Figure <ref>.\nAs a result, the optimal \u03b4 W_D along the ROC curve is roughly -40 minutes, which corresponds to approximately 11% increase in LVO stroke patients with less disability, more than 9 NNTB, and more than 1.4 MNT.  Remember that these results depend on our assumed reading rates and traffic intensity.  In the future we expect to gather clinical data to make more accurate estimates of reading rates, traffic intensity, and wait-time savings.\n\nBased on our queueing approach, the time-saving effectiveness of a CADt device depends largely on the clinical settings.\nOur model suggests that CADt devices with a typical AI diagnostic performance (95% sensitivity and 89% specificity) are most effective in a busy, short-staffed clinic.\nAll theoretical predictions agree with simulation results well within the 95% confidence intervals.\nAll software used in making the theoretical calculations and the simulations in this paper will be made available on the Github site for the FDA's Division of Imaging, Diagnostics, and Software Reliability, https://github.com/DIDSR/QuCAD.\n\nIn this work where only one disease is considered, the CADt device is trained to identify the disease, and a patient image can either be diseased or non-diseased.\nUnder this consideration, when evaluating the time-saving effectiveness of the CADt, \u03b4 W_D is used as the performance metric because the CADt device is intended to benefit diseased patients with time critical conditions.\nIn the future, when we expand our work to a reading queue that consists of patient images with two or more diseases, a new performance matric will be defined to take into account other time-critical diseases that the CADt does not look for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSION\n\n\n\nWe present a mathematical framework based on queueing theory and the Recursive Dimensionality Reduction method to quantify the time-saving effectiveness of an AI-based medical device that prioritizes patient images based on its binary classification outputs.\nSeveral models are developed to theoretically predict the wait-time-saving effectiveness of such a device as a function of various parameters, including disease prevalence, patient arrival rate, radiologist reading rate, number of radiologists on-site, AI sensitivity and specificity, as well as the presence of emergent patient images with the highest priority that overrides any AI prioritization.\nThe methodology proposed in this paper helps evaluate the time-saving performance of a CADt or any prioritization device.\nThe models presented here could also be used to evaluate discrimination algorithms in many other queueing contexts, such as serving customers or computer job queueing.\nIn the near future, we plan on expanding our model to clinical scenarios of multiple disease conditions, modalities, and anatomies with several CADt devices being used simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Mor Harchol-Balter (harchol@cs.cmu.edu) and Dr. Takayuki Osogami (OSOGAMI@jp.ibm.com) for helping us understand their Recursive Dimensionality Reduction (RDR) method for complex queueing systems.
