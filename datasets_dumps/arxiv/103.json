This skew reflects the market's expectation of significant price movements on very short time scales in the underlying asset, which poses a challenge to traditional continuous models based on standard Brownian motion. To address this issue, the literature has developed several classes of models that capture the skewness in implied volatilities. Three prominent approaches  are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  * conventional  one-factor stochastic volatility models boosted with large mean-reversion and vol-of-vol. This class of models have been  justified by  several empirical studies that have identified the presence of very fast mean-reversion in the S&P volatility time series <cit.> and by the fact that they are able to correct conventional models  to reproduce the behavior of the at-the-money (ATM) skew for short maturities  <cit.>;\n    \n    \n  * jump diffusion models, especially the class of affine jump-diffusions for which valuation problems become (semi-)explicit using Fourier inversion techniques, see <cit.>. Such class of models incorporates  occasional and large  jumps to explain the   skew  observed implicitly on option markets, see <cit.>, and <cit.> for an empirical analysis of the impact of adding jumps to stochastic volatility diffusion on the implied volatility surface;\n    \n    \n  * rough volatility models, where the volatility process is driven by variants of the Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion\n    \n    W_t^H = 1/\u0393( H+1/2 )\u222b_0^t ( t-s)^H-1/2dW_s,    t \u2265 0,\n\n    with W  a standard Brownian motion and H \u2208(0,1/2)  the Hurst index. Such models are  able to reproduce  the roughness of the spot variance's trajectories measured empirically <cit.> together with  the explosive behavior of the ATM-skew <cit.>.\n\n\n\nSo far, in the mathematical finance community, jump diffusion models and rough volatility models have  often been treated as distinct approaches, and, in some cases, they have even been opposed to each other, see for instance  <cit.>. However, on the one side,  connections between rough volatility models and fast mean-reverting factors have  been established in <cit.>. On the other side, jump models have been related to fast regimes stochastic volatility models in <cit.>. In parallel, from the empirical point of view,  it can be very challenging for the human eye and for statistical estimators to distinguish between roughness, fast mean-reversions and jump-like behavior, as shown in <cit.>. \n\n\n\nThe above suggests that rough volatility and jump models may not be that different after all. Our main motivation is to establish for the fist time in the literature  a connection between rough volatility and jump models through conventional volatility models with fast mean-reverting regimes. \n\n \n We aim to reconcile these two classes of models through the use of the celebrated conventional Heston model <cit.> but with a parametric specification which encodes a trade-off between a fast mean-reversion and a large vol-of-vol.  We define the  reversionary Heston model  as follows:\n    \n    dS_t^\u03f5 = S_t^\u03f5\u221a(V_t^\u03f5)( \u03c1 dW_t + \u221a(1-\u03c1^2) dW_t^\u22a5),    S_0^\u03f5=S_0,\n        dV^\u03f5_t =  ( \u03f5^H- 1/2\u03b8 - \u03f5^-1( V_t^\u03f5-V_0 ) ) dt + \u03f5^H-1/2\u03be\u221a(V_t^\u03f5)dW_t,    V^\u03f5_0=V_0,\n\n    where ( W, W^\u22a5) is a two-dimensional Brownian motion, \u03b8\u2265 0, S_0, \u03be, V_0 >0, \u03c1\u2208 [-1,1]. The two crucial parameters here are the reversionary time-scale \u03f5>0 and H \u2208\u211d. Such parametrizations nest as special cases the fast regimes extensively studied by <cit.>, see also <cit.>, which correspond to the case H=0; \n    and also the regimes studied in <cit.> for the case H = -1/2. Letting the parameter H\u2208(\u221e, 1/2] free in (<ref>)  introduces more flexibility in practice    and leads to better fits with stable calibrated parameters across time as recently shown in <cit.>. In theory, it allows for a better understanding of the impact of the scaling in H on the limiting behavior of the model as \u03f5\u2192 0  as highlighted in this paper.\n    \n\n\nIn a nutshell, we show that:\n\n\n    \n  * for H>-1/2, the reversionary Heston model  can be constructed as a proxy of rough and hyper-rough Heston models  where H \u2208 (-1/2,1/2] plays the role of the Hurst index,\n    \n  * for H\u2264 -1/2, as \u03f5\u2192 0,\n    the reversionary Heston model  converges towards L\u00e9vy jump processes of Normal Inverse Gaussian type with distinct regimes for H=-1/2 and H<-1/2 respectively,  \n    \n  * the reversionary Heston model is capable of generating implied volatility surfaces and  at-the-money (ATM) skews similar to the ones generated by rough, hyper-rough and jump models, and comes arbitrarily close to the ATM skew scaling as \u03c4^-0.5 for small \u03c4 that characterizes the market, contrary to widespread understanding. \n\n\nOur results allow for a  reconciliation between rough and jump models as they  suggest that jump models and (hyper-)rough volatility models are complementary, and do not overlap. For H>-1/2, the reversionary Heston model can be interpreted as a proxy of rough and hyper-rough volatility models, while for H\u2264 -1/2, it can be interpreted as a proxy of jump models. Jump models actually start at H=-1/2 (and below), the first value for which hyper-rough volatility models can no-longer be defined. \n\n\nMore precisely,  our argument is structured as follows.\nFirst, in Section\u00a0<ref>, we show how the reversionary Heston model (<ref>)-(<ref>) can be obtained as a Markovian and semimartingale proxy of rough and hyper-rough Heston models <cit.> with Hurst index H \u2208 (-1/2,1/2). This is achieved using the resolvent of the first kind of  the shifted fractional kernel. \n\nSecond, in Section\u00a0<ref>, we derive the joint conditional characteristic functional of the log-price log S^\u03f5 and the integrated variance V\u0305^\u03f5 := \u222b_0^\u00b7 V^\u03f5_s ds in the model  (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) in terms of a solution to a system of time-dependent Riccati ordinary differential equations; see Theorem\u00a0<ref>. Compared to the literature, we  provide a  novel and  concise proof for the existence and uniqueness of a global solution to such Riccati equations using the variation of constant formulas.\n\nFinally, in Section\u00a0<ref>, we establish the convergence of the log-price and the integrated variance (log S^\u03f5,V\u0305^\u03f5) in  the reversionary Heston model (<ref>)-(<ref>) towards a L\u00e9vy jump process (X,Y), as \u03f5 goes to 0. More precisely, we show that the limit (X, Y) belongs to the class of Normal Inverse Gaussian - Inverse Gaussian (NIG-IG) processes which we construct from its L\u00e9vy exponent and we connect such class to first hitting-time representations in the same spirit of <cit.>. Our main \nTheorem\u00a0<ref> provides the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions of the joint process (log S^\u03f5, V\u0305^\u03f5)  through the  study of the limiting behavior  of the Riccati equations and hence the  characteristic functional given in Theorem\u00a0<ref>. Interestingly, the limiting behavior disentangles three different asymptotic regimes based on the values of H. The convergence of the integrated variance process  is even strengthened  to a functional weak convergence on the Skorokhod space   of c\u00e0dl\u00e0g paths on [0,T] endowed with the M_1 topology. We stress that the usual J_1 topology is not useful here, since jump processes cannot be obtained as limits of continuous processes in the J_1 topology. \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Literature. \n Convergence of the reversionary Heston models towards jump processes: our results clarify and extend the results of <cit.>, derived for the case H=-1/2, that establish and make clear the precise limiting connection between the Heston log-price process and the normal inverse-Gaussian (NIG) process of <cit.>. Connections between the long time behavior of the Heston log-price process and NIG distribution were first exposed  in <cit.> and were the main motivations behind the work of <cit.>.\n\nRelevance of fast regimes in practice: the pricing of options near maturity is challenging because of the very steep slope of smiles observed on the market and <cit.> showed that stochastic volatility should embed both a fast regime Ornstein-Uhlenbeck factor (see Remark <ref> below) from which approximations of option prices can be derived using a singular perturbation expansion, and a slowly varying factor to be able to match options with long maturities. On the other hand, <cit.> considers a Heston model with a fast mean-reverting volatility and uses large deviation theory techniques to derive an approximation price for out-of-the-money vanilla options when the maturity is small, but large compared to the characteristic time-scale of the stochastic volatility factor. More recently an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with the same parametrization as in (<ref>) has been used to construct  the Quintic stochastic volatility model <cit.> to achieve remarkable joint fits of SPX and VIX implied volatilities, outperforming its rough and path-dependent counterparts as shown empirically in <cit.>.\n\n\n\nNotations. For p\u2265 1, we denote by L^p_loc the space of measurable functions f:_+\u2192 such that \u222b_0^T |f(s)|^p ds<\u221e, for all T>0. We will denote by \u221a(x) the principal square root of x \u2208\u2102, i.e.\u00a0its argument lies within (-\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2]. \n\n\n\n\u00a7 FROM ROUGH HESTON TO REVERSIONARY HESTON\n \n\n\nIn this section, we show how reversionary Heston models (<ref>)-(<ref>) can be seen as proxies of rough and hyper-rough Heston models whenever H>-1/2. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Rough and hyper-rough Heston\n\nLet ( W, W^\u22a5) be a two-dimensional Brownian motion and set  B := \u03c1 W + \u221a(1-\u03c1^2) W^\u22a5 with \u03c1\u2208[ -1, 1 ].  We take as starting point a stochastic volatility model for an underlying asset P in terms of a time-changed Brownian motion:\n\n    dP_t = P_t dB_U\u0305_t,     P_0>0,\n\n for some non-decreasing continuous process U\u0305. If U\u0305_t = \u222b_0^t U_s ds, then U would correspond to the spot variance and U\u0305 plays the role of the integrated variance. The hyper-rough Volterra Heston model introduced in <cit.>  and studied further in <cit.> assumes that the dynamics of the integrated variance is of the form\n\n    U\u0305_t = G\u0305_0(t) + \u03be\u222b_0^t K_H(t-s)  W_U\u0305_s ds,\n\nfor a suitable continuous function G\u0305_0, and \u03be > 0, and K_H is the fractional kernel\n\n    K_H(t)  =  t^H-1/2,    t >0,\n\n for H \u2208 (-1/2,1/2]. The lower bound H>-1/2 ensures the L^1_loc integrability of the kernel K_H so that the stochastic convolution appearing in (<ref>) is well-defined.\n\n\nAny kernel K only in L^1_loc can be considered for the specification of the integrated variance in (<ref>), and if furthermore the kernel happens to be in L^2_loc, the following lemma ensures the existence of a spot variance process.\n\n\n    Let K \u2208 L^2_loc and g_0 \u2208 L^1_loc. Assume there exists a non-decreasing adapted process U\u0305 and a Brownian motion W such that\n    \n    U\u0305_t  = \u222b_0^t g_0(s)ds + \u222b_0^t K(t-s) W_U\u0305_s ds,\n\n    with sup_t\u2264 T\ud835\udd3c[ | U\u0305_t | ] < \u221e, for all T>0. Then, U\u0305_t = \u222b_0^t U_s ds, where U is a non-negative weak solution to the following stochastic Volterra equation\n    \n    U_t = g_0(t) + \u222b_0^t K(t-s) \u221a(U_s)dW_s,    \u211a\u2297 dt-a.e.\n\n    Conversely, assume there exists a non-negative weak solution U to the stochastic Volterra equation (<ref>) such that sup_t\u2264 T\ud835\udd3c[ U^2_t ] < \u221e, for all T>0, then U\u0305 solves (<ref>).\n\n\n\n   This is obtained by an application of stochastic Fubini's theorem, see <cit.>.\n\n\nGoing back to the fractional case, if we restrict H  in ( 0, 1/2 ], then we have K_H \u2208 L^2_loc. For G\u0305_0(t) := \u222b_0^t g_0(s) ds, a direct application of Lemma <ref> yields that the model (<ref>)-(<ref>) is  equivalent to the rough Heston model of <cit.> written in spot-variance form\n\n    dP_t = P_t\u221a(U_t)dB_t, \n        U_t = g_0(t) + \u222b_0^t K_H(t-s) \u03be\u221a(U_s) dW_s,\n\nfor some initial input curve g_0: \u211d_+ \u2192\u211d ensuring the non-negativity of V. Two notable specifications of such admissible input curves  are given by <cit.> and read \n\n    g_0  continuous and non-decreasing with  g_0 \u2265 0,\n    or\n    \n         g_0(t) = U_0 + \u03b8\u222b_0^t K_H(s)ds,  for some  U_0, \u03b8\u2265 0.\n\n  \n\nMoreover, for H\u2208 (0,1/2] the sample paths of the spot variance U are locally H\u00f6lder continuous of any order strictly less than H, and consequently rougher than those of the standard Brownian motion, which corresponds to the  case H=1/2, justifying the denomination  `rough model'.   The hyper-rough appellation corresponds to the case H\u2208 (-1/2,0] for which the process U\u0305 is continuous but no longer absolutely continuous. Indeed, in this case, one can show that the trajectories of U are nowhere differentiable, see <cit.>.\n\n\nA key advantage of rough and hyper-rough Heston models is the semi-explicit knowledge  of the characteristic function of the log-price modulo a deterministic Riccati Volterra convolution equation, as they belong the class of Affine Volterra processes <cit.>. More precisely,   \nfor any u=(u_1,u_2) \u2208\u2102^2  satisfying  \n    (u_1)=0,  (u_2) \u2264 0,\n \n\tthe joint Fourier\u2013Laplace transform of (log P, U\u0305)  is given by\n\t\n    \ud835\udd3c[ exp( u_1log P_T + u_2 U\u0305_T  ) ] = exp(  u_1 log P_0 +   \u222b_0^T  R(\u03c8_H(T-s))dG\u0305_0(s) ),\n\n\tfor all T \u2265 0, where \u03c8_H is the continuous solution to the following fractional Riccati\u2013Volterra equation\n\n    \u03c8_H(t)   =\u222b_0^t K_H(t-s)  R(\u03c8_H(s))ds,    t \u2265 0, \n    \n    \tR(x)   =1/2 (u_1^2 -u_1) +u_2 +  \u03c1\u03bd  u_1 x + \u03bd^2/2 x^2,\n\nsee <cit.>.\nThis allows fast pricing and calibration via Fourier inversion techniques. Compared to the conventional Heston model where the characteristic function is known explicitly, the solution to the Riccati Volterra equation is not explicitly known. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Deriving  reversionary Heston as a proxy: \u03f5-shifting  the singularity\n\nIn both regimes,  rough and hyper-rough, with the exception of H=1/2, the model is non-Markovian, non-semimartingale with singular kernels. From a practitioner standpoint, it  is therefore natural to look  for  Markovian approximations by suitable smoothing  of the singularity of the fractional kernel (<ref>) sitting at the origin.\nIn this section, we show how we can build a Markovian semi-martingale proxy of hyper-rough models. This is achieved using a two-step procedure. \n\n\nFirst step: recover semimartingality by smoothing out the singularity of the fractional kernel K_H. \nWe fix \u03f5>0, and  we  consider the shifted fractional kernel \n\n    K_H, \u03f5(t) := ( t+ \u03f5)^H-1/2,    t> 0,\n\nand the corresponding `integrated variance' U\u0305^\u03f5 given by \n\n    U\u0305^\u03f5_t = \u222b_0^t g_0^\u03f5(s) ds + \u03be\u222b_0^t K_H, \u03f5(t-s)  W_U\u0305^\u03f5_s ds,\n\nwith   \n\n    g_0^\u03f5(t) = U_0 + \u03b8\u222b_0^t K_H,\u03f5(s)ds.\n\nNote that now K_H, \u03f5 is in L^2_loc for any value of H, so that an application of Lemma\u00a0<ref> yields that U\u0305^\u03f5 = \u222b_0^\u00b7 U^\u03f5_s ds where the spot variance U^\u03f5 solves the equation \n\n    dP^\u03f5_t    = P^\u03f5_t \u221a(U^\u03f5_t)dB_t \n    \n         U^\u03f5_t    = U_0 + \u222b_0^t K_H,\u03f5(t-s) \u03b8 ds  + \u222b_0^t K_H,\u03f5(t-s) \u03be\u221a(U^\u03f5_s) dW_s.\n\nMoreover, since K_H,\u03f5 is continuously differentiable on [0,T], denoting by K'_H,\u03f5 its derivative, we get that U^\u03f5 is a semimartingale with the following dynamics \n\n    dU_t^\u03f5 =   (K_H,\u03f5 (0)\u03b8 + \u222b_0^t K'_H,\u03f5(t-s) dZ_s^\u03f5)dt + K_H,\u03f5 (0) \u03be\u221a(U_t^\u03f5) dW_t,\n\nwith\n\n    dZ^\u03f5_t  = \u03b8 dt + \u03be\u221a(U_t^\u03f5) dW_t.\n\n\n\nSecond step: recover a Markovian proxy thanks to the resolvent of the first kind.  The only non-Markovian term in (<ref>) is the term \u222b_0^t K'_H,\u03f5(t-s) dZ_s^\u03f5 appearing in the drift. Using the resolvent of the first kind of K_H,\u03f5 we will re-express this term in terms of a functional of the past of the process U^\u03f5.  For a kernel K, a resolvent of the first kind is a  measure L on _+ of locally bounded variation such that\n\n    \u222b_[0,t] K(t-s)L(ds) = 1,    t\u2265 0,\n\nsee <cit.>.  A resolvent of the first kind does not always exist.  We will make use of the notations (f*g)(t)=\u222b_0^tf(t-s)g(s)ds and (f*L)(t)=\u222b_[0,t]f(t-s)L(ds). \n\n\n\n\n    Fix \u03f5>0 and H \u2208 (-1/2,1/2). The kernel K_H, \u03f5 admits a resolvent of the first kind L_\u03f5  of the form\n\n    L_\u03f5 (dt)= \u03b4_0 (dt)/K_H,\u03f5(0) + \u2113_\u03f5(t)dt,\n\nwith \u2113_\u03f5 a locally integrable function.\nMoreover,  the function ( K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5) is continuously differentiable and it holds, for all t\u2265 0, that\n\n    \u222b_0^t K'_H,\u03f5(t-s) dZ_s^\u03f5  =  - ( 1/2-H ) \u03f5^-1( U_t^\u03f5-U_0)  + \u222b_0^t ( K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)'(t-s)   ( U_s^\u03f5 - U_0) ds.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the existence of the resolvent is justified as follows. Given H \u2208 (-1/2,1/2), K_H, \u03f5 is a positive completely monotone kernel[Recall that a function f is completely monotone if it is infinitely differentiable on (0,\u221e) such that (-1)^n f^(n)\u2265 0, for all n \u2265 0.] on [0,T] so that an  application of <cit.> yields the existence of a resolvent of the first kind in the form (<ref>) with \u2113_\u03f5 a completely monotone function. Convolving (<ref>) with K'_H,\u03f5 one obtains that \n\n    (K'_H,\u03f5 * L_\u03f5)(t)  = K'_H,\u03f5(0)/K_H,\u03f5(0) +  (K'_H,\u03f5 * \u2113_\u03f5)(t).\n\nSince K_H,\u03f5 is twice continuously differentiable on [0,T] and \u2113_\u03f5 is integrable, it follows that (K'_H,\u03f5 * \u2113_\u03f5) is continuously differentiable and so is (K'_H,\u03f5 * L_\u03f5). Writing \n\n    ( K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5) = ( K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)(0)+ 1 * ( K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)',\n\nconvolving  on the left hand side by  by K_H, \u03f5 combined with the associativity of the convolution operation and the fact that (L_\u03f5*K_H, \u03f5)=1 yields:\n\n    K_H, \u03f5' * 1 = K_H, \u03f5' *( L_\u03f5*K_H, \u03f5) = (K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)*K_H, \u03f5 = ( K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)(0) (1*K_H, \u03f5) + 1 * ( K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)'*K_H, \u03f5.\n\nAnd thus, we obtain almost everywhere with regards to the Lebesgue measure that:\n\n    K_H, \u03f5' = ( K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)(0) K_H, \u03f5 + (K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)' * K_H, \u03f5.\n\nIn addition, using (<ref>), we notice that\n\n    ( K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)(0)= K_H, \u03f5'(0)/K_H, \u03f5(0) = ( H-1/2) \u03f5^-1.\n\nCombining the above, we obtain that \n\n    \u222b_0^t K'_H,\u03f5(t-s) dZ_s^\u03f5  =  ( H-1/2) \u03f5^-1\u222b_0^t K_H,\u03f5(t-s) dZ_s^\u03f5    + ((K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)' * (K_H, \u03f5*dZ_t^\u03f5))_t,\n\nwhich yields (<ref>), after recalling that U^\u03f5 - U_0 = \u222b_0^\u00b7 K_H,\u03f5(\u00b7-s) dZ_s^\u03f5.\n\n\nWith the help of the resolvent of the first kind, we were able to recover in the first term of (<ref>), the first order mean-reversion scale  of the fractional kernel, the second term depends on the whole past trajectory of U^\u03f5.\n\nWe can now derive our Markovian proxy of the hyper-rough Heston model as follows: plugging the expression (<ref>) in the drift of (<ref>), recalling that K_H,\u03f5(0)=\u03f5^H-1/2 and dropping the non-Markovian term ( ( K_H, \u03f5' * L_\u03f5)' )_. * ( U^\u03f5_\u00b7 - U_0^\u03f5) )_t, we arrive to the Markovian process:\n\n    d \u1e7c_t^\u03f5 = (  \u03f5^H-1/2\u03b8  -  ( 1/2-H ) \u03f5^-1( \u1e7c_t^\u03f5 - U_0) ) ) dt + \u03f5^H-1/2\u03be\u221a(\u1e7c_t^\u03f5) dW_t,   \u1e7c_0 = U_0.\n\n\nFinally, re-scaling the mean-reversion speed from ( 1/2-H ) \u03f5^-1 to \u03f5^-1 leads to our reversionary Heston model  (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) where the parameter H becomes unconstrained.  In the following section, we illustrate numerically  the fact that such reversionary Heston model can be seen as a proxy of rough and hyper-rough Heston models. \n\n\n    Such proxy approximation can directly be applied to the Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion defined in (<ref>) to get the proxy:\n    \n    W_t^H,\u03f5 = \u03f5^H-1/2\u222b_0^t e^- ( 1/2-H ) \u03f5^-1 (t-s) dW_s,\n\n    which is a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as long as H<1/2, while the value H=1/2 yields back the standard Brownian motion.\n First, such Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process has been recently used to construct  the Quintic stochastic volatility model <cit.> to achieve remarkable joint fits of SPX and VIX implied volatilies, outperforming even its rough and path-dependent counterparts as shown empirically in <cit.>. \n\n    Furthermore, notice that the case H=0 degenerates into the fast scale volatility factor from <cit.>, with m=0, \u03bd=1 and their time-scale is twice the reversionary time-scale \u03f5, and whose auto-correlation under the invariant distribution is given by\n    \n    \ud835\udd3c[ W_t^0,\u03f5 W_s^0,\u03f5] = e^-|t-s|/2\u03f5.\n\n    Consequently, the reversionary time-scale \u03f5 sets the speed of decay of the auto-correlation function of W^H,\u03f5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Numerical illustration\n\n\nWe now illustrate numerically that the reversionary Heston model  (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) is able to reproduce  shapes of   implied volatility surfaces and at-the-money skew that are similar to the ones generated by rough and hyper-rough Heston models.\n\n\nFor this, we first generate implied volatility surfaces of the hyper-rough and rough Heston model via the Fourier-Cosine series expansion technique from <cit.>, where we used the fractional Adams scheme described in <cit.> on the fractional Riccati equation (<ref>) to compute the characteristic function of the (hyper-)rough Heston models. Three target smiles are generated with a (hyper-)rough Heston having parameters\n\n    \u03c1=-0.7,   \u03b8=0.02,   \u03be=0.3,    U_0=0.02,\n\nfor H \u2208{ 0.1, 0, -0.05 }.\n\nFor each of these smiles, we  calibrate the parameters ( \u03f5\u0302, \u0124) of the reversionary Heston model (<ref>)-(<ref>),  while fixing the other parameters equal to those of the hyper-rough Heston's, by minimizing a weighted  loss\n\n    \u2211_i,j w_i,j( C_rough Heston(T_i,K_j)-C^\u03f5\u0302, \u0124_reversionary Heston(T_i,K_j) )^2.\n\nThe reversionary Heston prices are also obtained by Fourier-Cosine expansion of the characteristic function. In contrast to the rough Heston models, the characteristic function is known explicitly, see Corollary <ref> below.  \nAfter calibration, we obtain the following parameters\n\n\nThe resulting At-The-Money (ATM) skews between 1 week and 1 year are shown on Figure\u00a0<ref>. The implied volatility surfaces for the case H=0.1 is illustrated on Figure\u00a0<ref>. The fit of the smiles for H=0 and H=-0.05 are deferred to Appendix <ref>, see Figures <ref> and <ref>. The graphs show that the reversionary Heston model seems to be able to generate similar shapes of the implied volatility surfaces of rough and hyper-rough models and very steep skews even in the hyper rough regimes H\u2264 0. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE JOINT CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTIONAL OF REVERSIONARY HESTON\n\nThe following theorem provides the joint conditional characteristic functional of the log-price log S^\u03f5 and the integrated variance V\u0305^\u03f5 := \u222b_0^\u00b7 V^\u03f5_s ds in the model  (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) in terms of a solution to a system of time-dependent Riccati ordinary differential equations. \n\n\n     Let f,g: [0,T]\u2192\u2102 be measurable and bounded functions  such that\n\n    g + 1/2(( f)^2 - f)  \u2264 0.\n\nThen, the joint conditional characteristic functional of (log S^\u03f5, V\u0305^\u03f5) is given by \n\n    \ud835\udd3c[ . exp(\u222b_t^T f(T-s) dlog S^\u03f5_s + \u222b_t^T g(T-s) d V\u0305_s^\u03f5) | \u2131_t ] = exp(\u03d5_\u03f5( T-t ) + \u03f5^1/2-H\u03c8_\u03f5( T-t ) V^\u03f5_t ),    t \u2264 T,\n\nwhere (\u03d5_\u03f5, \u03c8_\u03f5) is the solution to the following system of time-dependent Riccati equations \n\n    \u03d5_\u03f5'(t)     = ( \u03b8 + \u03f5^-H-1/2 V_0 ) \u03c8_\u03f5(t),   \u03d5_\u03f5(0) = 0, \n     \n    \u03c8_\u03f5'(t)     =  \u03f5^H-1/2\u03be^2/2\u03c8_\u03f5 ^2(t) +  ( \u03c1\u03be\u03f5^H - 1/2 f(t) - \u03f5^-1) \u03c8_\u03f5(t) \n                + \u03f5^H - 1/2( g(t) + f^2(t)-f(t)/2),     \u03c8_\u03f5(0) = 0.\n\n\n\n\n    The proof is given in Section\u00a0<ref> below.\n\nBefore proving the result, we note that in the case f and g are constant, one recovers the usual formula for the characteristic function of the <cit.>  model, where the solution (\u03d5_\u03f5, \u03c8_\u03b5) of (<ref>)-(<ref>) is explicit as stated in the following corollary. \n\n\n\n Let u,v \u2208\u211d and set \nf(t) =i u and g(t)=i v, for all t\u2208  [0,T]. Then, the solution (\u03d5_\u03f5,\u03c8_\u03f5)  to the Riccati equations (<ref>)-(<ref>) is explicitly given by \n\n    \u03d5_\u03f5(t)    = ( \u03f5^-1/2-H\u03b8 + \u03f5^-1-2H V_0) \u03be^-2( ( 1 - i \u03c1\u03f5^H+1/2\u03be u - d ) t - 2 \u03f5ln( 1 - ge^- \u03f5^-1 td/1-g) ), \n    \u03c8_\u03f5(t)    = \u03f5^-H-1/2\u03be^-2( 1 - i \u03c1\u03f5^H+1/2\u03be u - d ) 1 - e^- \u03f5^-1 td /1 - ge^- \u03f5^-1 td  ,\n\nwith\n\n    g     := 1 - i \u03c1\u03f5^H+1/2\u03be u - d/1 - i \u03c1\u03f5^H+1/2\u03be u + d,    \n        d  := \u221a(( 1 - i \u03c1\u03f5^H+1/2\u03be u )^2 - 2 ( \u03f5^H+1/2\u03be)^2 ( i v - u^2 + iu/2)),    d > 0.\n\n Consequently, the conditional joint characteristic function  of (log S_T^\u03f5, \u222b_t^T V^\u03f5_s ds ) is given by \n\n    \ud835\udd3c[ . exp( iu logS^\u03f5_T + iv\u222b_t^T   V_s^\u03f5 ds) | \u2131_t ] = exp(iulog S^\u03f5_t +\u03d5_\u03f5( T-t ) + \u03f5^1/2-H\u03c8_\u03f5( T-t ) V^\u03f5_t ),    t \u2264 T.\n\n\n\n\n    For the explicit derivation of the formulas, see for example  <cit.>. An application of Theorem\u00a0<ref> yields the result.\n\n\n\nSuch formulas for \u03d5_\u03f5 avoid branching issues as described in <cit.>.\n\n\nThe rest of the section if dedicated to the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>. We first study the existence of a solution to time-dependent Riccati ODEs for which equation (<ref>) is a particular case, and provide some of their properties in Section\u00a0<ref>. We complete the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref> in Section\u00a0<ref>. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Time-dependent Riccati ODEs: existence and uniqueness\n\n\n In this section, we consider a generic class of time-dependent Ricatti equations that encompass \n equation (<ref>),  in the form \n\n    \u03c8'(t)  = \n    a(t) \u03c8^2(t) + b(t) \u03c8(t) + c(t),   \u03c8(0) = u_0,    t\u2264 T,\n\n with u_0 \u2208\u2102 and a,b,c:[0,T]\u2192\u2102 three measurable and bounded functions. We say that \u03c8:[0,t^*] \u2192\u2102 for some t^* \u2208( 0,T ] is a local extended solution to (<ref>) with some initial condition \u03c8(0)=u_0 \u2208\u2102 if, almost everywhere on [0,t^*], it is continuously differentiable and satisfies the relations in (<ref>). The extended solution is global if t^*=T.\n  \n\nThe presence of the squared non-linearity in (<ref>) precludes the application of the celebrated Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem and  can lead to explosive solutions in finite time. Compared to the related literature on similar Riccati equations  <cit.>, we provide a concise and simplified proof for the existence and uniqueness of a global extended solution to the Riccati equation (<ref>) using a variation of constant formula under the following assumption on the coefficients (a,b,c) and the initial condition u_0:\n\n    (a(t)) = 0,     a(t) >0,   ( c(t) ) + ( b(t) )^2/4a(t)\u2264 0,   (u_0)\u2264 0,    t\u2264 T.\n\n\nThe following theorem gives the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the Riccati equation (<ref>).\n\n \nLet u_0\u2208\u2102 with (u_0)\u2264 0 and a,b,c:[0,T]\u2192\u2102 be measurable and bounded functions satisfying (<ref>). Then,  there exists a unique extended solution \u03c8:[0,T]\u2192\u2102 to the Ricatti equation (<ref>) such that \n\n    (\u03c8(t))\u2264 0,    t\u2264 T,\n\nand\n\n    sup_t\u2264 T |\u03c8(t)|<\u221e.\n\n\n\n\n For the existence part, we proceed in two steps. First, we  start by arguing the existence of a local solution using \nCarath\u00e9odory's theorem.  For this we rely on <cit.>,  using the notations therein (see equation (1.7) for example), we consider the integral equation\n\n    \u03c8(t) = \u03c8(0) + \u222b_0^t g (t,s,\u03c8(s))ds,    t \u2265 0,\n\nwhere the operator g is defined by\n\n    g(t,s,\u03c8(s)):= a(s) x(s)^2 + b(s) x(s) + c(s).\n\n Let D be an open, connected subset of \u211d^+ \u00d7\u2102 that contains ( 0, \u03c8(0) ). Define\n\n    T_\u221e := sup{ t \u2208\u211d^+ | C_\u03c8(0),D( [0,T), \u2102) \u2260\u2205},\n\nwhere\n\n    C_\u03c8(0),D( [0,T), \u2102) := {\u03d5\u2208 C( D, \u2102) | \u03d5(0) = \u03c8(0)  and ( t, \u03d5(t)) \u2208 D  for  t \u2208 [0,T)}.\n\nAn application of  <cit.>  yields the existence of a unique non-continuable solution to (<ref>) that satisfies ( t, \u03c8(t) ) \u2208 D on the interval [0,T_\u221e) such that either T_\u221e = T or t \u2192 T_\u221elim |\u03c8(t)| = \u221e.  Indeed, the assumptions (i) to (v) of <cit.> are readily satisfied by boundedness and integrability of a, b and c and the fact that g does not depend on t and satisfies the Carath\u00e9odory conditions.\n\n  For the existence part, assume without loss of generality that u_0=0. Define the local domain\n  \n    D: 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T,   | x | \u2264 b,\n\n  with T and b are positive real numbers. The right-hand function f(t,x) := a(t) x^2 + b(t) x + c(t) satisfies the three Carath\u00e9odory conditions on D such that\n  \n      \n  * x \u21a6 f(t,x) is continuous for almost all t \u2208[ 0, T ],\n      \n  * t \u21a6 f(t,x) is measurable for all x,\n      \n  * | f(t,x) | \u2264 A | x |^2 + B | x | + C \u2264 A b^2 + B b + C =: K(b) < \u221e, with K(b) a constant (which is integrable on [ 0, T ]) depending on b and a,b and c are upper-bounded by A, B and C respectively.\n  \n  \nConsequently, <cit.> yields the existence of a local extended solution \u03c8 to (<ref>) up to a maximal time 0<t_+\u2264 T, and one can take an arbitrary number t_+ which satisfies the inequalities\n\n    0 \u2264 t_+ \u2264 T,    t_+ \u2264b/K(b)\n\nC'est un mauvais r\u00e9sultat car la borne sup\u00e9rieure en temps d\u00e9pend de la borne en espace, et T \u2192 0 pour b \u2192 0... \n\n\nThe right-hand function f(t,x) := a(t) x^2 + b(t) x + c(t) satisfies the three Carath\u00e9odory conditions and <cit.> yields the existence of a local extended solution \u03c8 to (<ref>) up to a maximal time t_+\u2264 T such that either t_+ = T or t \u2192 t_+lim |\u03c8(t)| = \u221e[How to justify this?].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, we argue that \n\n\n    sup_t\u2264 T_\u221e |\u03c8(t)|<\u221e,\n \nwhich would then yield T_\u221e=T and the existence of a global solution \u03c8.  Let t< T_\u221e. We start by showing that (\u03c8(t)) \u2264 0.  Indeed, taking real parts in (<ref>), \u03c8_ r:=( \u03c8) satisfies the following equation on [0,T_\u221e):\n    \n    \u03c8_ r' (s)= { a(s) ( \u03c8(s) ) + ( b(s) ) }\u03c8_ r(s)+ d(s),\n\nwhere d(s) = - a(s) ( ( \u03c8(s) ) + ( b(s) )/2a(s))^2 + ( c(s) ) + ^2( b(s) )/4a(s)\u2264 0 thanks to condition (<ref>), after a completion of squares. The variation of constant for \u03c8_ r then yields\n    \n    \u03c8_ r(t) = e^\u222b_0^t ( a(u) ( \u03c8(u) ) + ( b(u) ) ) du(u_0)  + \u222b_0^t   d(s)  e^\u222b_s^t ( a(u) ( \u03c8(u) ) + ( b(u) ) ) duds \u2264 0,\n\n since the exponential is positive and d(s)\u2264 0, and (u_0)\u2264 0 by assumption.  This shows that (\u03c8)\u2264 0, on [0,T_\u221e). Finally, an application of a similar variation of constants formula on  equation (<ref>) leads to \n  \n    \u03c8(t) = e^\u222b_0^t ( a(u) ( \u03c8(u) ) + ( b(u) ) ) du u_0  + \u222b_0^t  e^\u222b_s^t ( a(u) ( \u03c8(u) ) +  ( b(u) ) ) du c(s) ds,\n\nso that taking the module together with the triangle inequality and the fact that (\u03c8)\u2264 0 on [0,T_\u221e), yields \n\n    |\u03c8(t)|    \u2264 |e^\u222b_0^t ( a(u)  \u03c8(u)  + ( b(u) ) ) du | |u_0|  + \u222b_0^t  | e^\u222b_s^t ( a(u)  \u03c8(u)+  ( b(u) ) ) du|  |c(s)| ds\n       =    e^\u222b_0^t ( a(u)  ( \u03c8(u) ) + ( b(u) ) ) du  |u_0|  + \u222b_0^t  e^\u222b_s^t ( a(u)  ( \u03c8(u) ) +  ( b(u) ) ) du |c(s)|ds\n       \u2264  e^\u222b_0^t  ( b(u) )  du  |u_0|  + \u222b_0^T  e^\u222b_s^t  ( b(u) )  du  |c(s)|ds \n       \u2264 C( |u_0| + \u222b_0^T |c(s)|ds),\n\nwhere C=sup_s,s'\u2208 [0,T]^2 e^\u222b_s^s'(b(u)) du  does not depend on t \n and is finite by boundedness of b. \nThis shows (<ref>) as needed. Combining the above we obtain the existence of a solution \u03c8 on [0,T] satisfying (<ref>) and (<ref>).\n\n\nTo argue uniqueness, assume there are two such extended solutions \u03c8_1 and \u03c8_2 that satisfy (<ref>).

Let us rewrite the Ricatti ODE from (<ref>) as\n\n    \u03c8_\u03f5'(t) = a_\u03f5\u03c8_\u03f5 ^2(t) + b_\u03f5(t) \u03c8_\u03f5(t) +c_\u03f5(t),   \u03c8_\u03f5(0) = 0,    t \u2264 T,\n\nwhere we defined\n\n    a_\u03f5    := \u03f5^H-1/2\u03be^2/2\n    \n        b_\u03f5(t)     := \u03f5^H-1/2\u03c1\u03be f(t) -  \u03f5^-1\n    \n        c_\u03f5(t)     := \u03f5^H-1/2[ g(t) + f^2(t) - f(t)/2].\n\nSince condition (<ref>) ensures\n\n    ( c_\u03f5) + ( b_\u03f5)^2/4a_\u03f5 = \u03f5^H-1/2(  g + 1/2( ( f)^2 -  f ) + ( \u03c1^2 - 1 ) (  f )^2 ) \u2264 0,\n\nthen conditions (<ref>) are readily satisfied and consequently Theorem <ref> yields the existence and uniqueness of a solution \u03c8_\u03f5:[0,T]\u2192\u2102\nto the Ricatti ODE (<ref>) such that\n\n    (\u03c8_\u03f5(t)) \u2264 0,   t \u2264 T.\n\n The function  \u03d5_\u03f5 defined  in integral form as\n\n    \u03d5_\u03f5(t) = ( \u03b8 + \u03f5^-H-1/2 V_0 ) \u222b_0^t \u03c8_\u03f5(s)ds,    t \u2264 T,\n\nsolves  (<ref>). \n\nWe now prove the expression for the charateristic functional (<ref>). Define the following process M:\n\n    M_t    = exp(U_t),  \n    \n    U_t    =  \u03d5_\u03f5( T-t ) + \u03f5^1/2-H\u03c8_\u03f5( T-t ) V^\u03f5_t +    \u222b_0^t f(T-s) dlog S^\u03f5_s + \u222b_0^t g(T-s) d V\u0305_s^\u03f5.\n\nIn order to obtain (<ref>), it suffices to show that M is a martingale. Indeed, if this is the case, and after observing that the terminal value of M  is  given by\n\n    M_T = exp(  \u222b_0^T f(T-s) dlog S^\u03f5_s + \u222b_0^T g(T-s) d V\u0305_s^\u03f5),\n\nrecall that \u03d5_\u03f5( 0 )=\u03c8_\u03f5( 0 )=0,\nwe obtain \n\n    \ud835\udd3c[ exp(  \u222b_0^T f(T-s) dlog S^\u03f5_s + \u222b_0^T g(T-s) d V\u0305_s^\u03f5) |\u2131_t] =  \ud835\udd3c[  M_T  | \u2131_t] = M_t = exp(U_t),\n\nwhich yields (<ref>). We now argue that M is a martingale. We first show that M is a local martingale using It\u00f4 formula. The dynamics of M read\n\n    dM_t = M_t (dU_t + 1/2 d\u27e8 U\u27e9_t ),\n\nwith \n\n    dU_t =    {\u03d5_\u03f5'(T-t) - ( \u03b8 + \u03f5^-1/2-H V_0 ) \u03c8_\u03f5(T-t)  + ( - \u03f5^1/2-H\u03c8_\u03f5 '(T-t) - \u03f5^-1/2-H\u03c8_\u03f5(T-t) + g(T-t) - f(T-t)/2) V^\u03f5_t } dt\n        + ( \u03be\u03c8_\u03f5(T-t) + \u03c1 f(T-t) ) \u221a(V^\u03f5_t)dW_t+\u221a(1-\u03c1^2)f(T-t)\u221a(V^\u03f5_t)dW^\u22a5_t.\n\nThis yields that the drift in dM_t/M_t is given by \n\n    \u03d5_\u03f5'(T-t) - ( \u03b8 + \u03f5^-1/2-H V_0 ) \u03c8_\u03f5(T-t) \n        + ( - \u03f5^1/2-H\u03c8_\u03f5'(T-t) + \u03be^2/2( \u03c8_\u03f5 (T-t) )^2 + ( \u03c1\u03be f(T-t) - \u03f5^-1/2-H) \u03c8_\u03f5(T-t) + g(T-t) + f^2(T-t) - f(T-t)/2) V^\u03f5_t\n\n\nwhich is equal to 0 from the Riccati equations (<ref>) and (<ref>). This shows that M is a local martingale. \nTo argue that M is a true martingale, we note that (\u03c8_\u03f5)\u2264 0 which implies (\u03d5_\u03f5)\u2264 0, so that \n\n    (U_t)    \u2264\u222b_0^t (f(T-s)) dlog S^\u03f5_s + \u222b_0^t (g(T-s)) d V\u0305_s^\u03f5\n       = \u222b_0^t ( (g(T-s)) \n     -1/2(f(T-s)))  V_s^\u03f5 ds + \u222b_0^t   (f(T-s))  \u221a(V_s^\u03f5)dB_s \n       \u2264  -1/2\u222b_0^t  \n    (f(T-s))^2 V_s^\u03f5 ds + \u222b_0^t   (f(T-s))  \u221a(V_s^\u03f5)dB_s=:\u0168_t,\n\nwhere the last inequality follows from (<ref>).  It follows that \n\n    |M_t|=exp((U_t)) \u2264exp(\u0168_t),\n\nwhere the process exp(\u0168) is a true martingale, see <cit.>. This shows that  M is a true martingale, being a local martingale bounded by a true martingale, see <cit.>, which concludes the proof. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 FROM REVERSIONARY HESTON TO JUMP PROCESSES\n\n\nIn this section, we establish the convergence of the log-price and the integrated variance (log S^\u03f5,V\u0305^\u03f5) in  the reversionary Heston model (<ref>)-(<ref>) towards a L\u00e9vy jump process (X,Y), as \u03f5 goes to 0. More precisely, the limit (X, Y) belongs to the class of Normal Inverse Gaussian - Inverse Gaussian (NIG-IG) processes defined as follows.\n\n Fix  \u03b1\u2265 |\u03b2| \u2265 0, \u03b4,\u03bb > 0 and \u03bc\u2208. We say that ( X_t, Y_t )_t \u2265 0 is a Normal Inverse Gaussian - Inverse Gaussian (NIG-IG) process with parameters ( \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b4,\u03bc,  \u03bb) if it is a two-dimensional homogeneous L\u00e9vy process with c\u00e0dl\u00e0g sample paths, starting  from (X_0,Y_0)=(0,0) almost surely, with L\u00e9vy exponent \u03b7 defined by\n\n    \u03b7(u,v) := [ i \u03bc u + \u03b4( \u221a(\u03b1^2 - \u03b2^2) -\u221a(\u03b1^2 - 2i\u03bb v -( \u03b2 + iu )^2)) ],    u, v \u2208\u211d,\n\ni.e.\u00a0the joint characteristic function is given by\n\n    \ud835\udd3c[ exp( iu X_t + iv Y_t ) ] = exp( \u03b7(u,v) t ),    u, v \u2208\u211d,    t \u2264 T.\n\n\n\nIn order to justify the existence of such a class of L\u00e9vy processes, one needs to justify that \u03b7 given in (<ref>) is indeed the logarithm of a characteristic function associated to an infinitely divisible distribution, see  <cit.>.  \n This is the object of the following lemma, which also provides the link with first-hitting times and subordinated processes. \n\n\n    Let \u03b1\u2265 |\u03b2| \u2265 0, \u03b4,\u03bb > 0, \u03bc\u2208  and   (W, W^\u22a5) be a two dimensional Brownian motion. Let (\u039b_t)_t\u2208 [0,T] be the first hitting-time process defined as\n    \n    \u039b_t :=  inf{ s \u2265 0 : \u221a(\u03b1^2-\u03b2^2)s + W_s\u2265\u03b4 t },    t \u2208[ 0,T \n        ],\n\nand define Z as the following shifted subordinated process \n\n    Z_t =\u03bc t + \u03b2\u039b_t +  W^\u22a5_\u039b_t,    t \u2208[ 0,T \n        ].\n\nThen,\n\n    \ud835\udd3c[ exp( iuZ_t+ iv \u03bb\u039b_t ) ]  = exp(\u03b7(u,v)t),    u,v \u2208\u211d,    t \u2208[ 0,T \n        ].\n\n In particular, \u03b7 given by (<ref>) is the logarithm of the characteristic function  of the joint random variable (Z_1,\u03bb\u039b_1) which is infinitely divisible.\n\n\nFix t \u2208[ 0,T ]. By construction, it is well-known that  \u039b_t has an Inverse Gaussian distribution if \u03b1 > | \u03b2| with parameters IG( \u03b4 t/\u221a(\u03b1^2 - \u03b2^2), \u03b4^2 t ), and in the drift-free case \u03b1 = | \u03b2|, \u039b_t follows a L\u00e9vy distribution with parameters L\u00e9vy( 0, \u03b4^2 t ) (see <cit.> and Definition <ref> in the Appendix). Now conditional on \u039b_t, Z_t is Gaussian with parameters \ud835\udca9( \u03bc t + \u03b2\u039b_t, \u039b_t ) and using the tower property of conditional expectation, we get for the first case that\n    \n    \ud835\udd3c[exp( iu Z_t + iv \u03bb\u039b_t ) ]     = \ud835\udd3c[ \ud835\udd3c[ . exp( iu Z_t ) | \u039b_t ] exp( iv \u03bb\u039b_t ) ] \n        = \ud835\udd3c[ exp( iu ( \n            \u03bc t + \u03b2\u039b_t ) - \u039b_t u^2/2 + iv \u03bb\u039b_t ) ] \n        = exp( iu \u03bc t ) \ud835\udd3c[ exp( ( iu \u03b2 - u^2/2 + iv \u03bb) \u039b_t ) ] \n        = exp( iu \u03bc t + \u03b4 t \u221a(\u03b1^2 - \u03b2^2)( 1 - \u221a(1-2/\u03b1^2 - \u03b2^2( iu \u03b2 - u^2/2 + iv \u03bb))) )\n    i.e. \ud835\udd3c[ exp( iuZ_t+iv\u03bb\u039b_t ) ]     = exp( i u \u03bc t + \u03b4 t ( \u221a(\u03b1^2 - \u03b2^2) -\u221a(\u03b1^2 - 2i\u03bb v -( \u03b2 + iu )^2))) = exp(\u03b7(u,v)t),    u,v \u2208\u211d,\n\nwhere we used Definition <ref> to get the fourth equality, noting that ( i (u \u03b2 + v \u03bb) - u^2/2) \u2264 0. Similar computations yield the result for the case \u03b1 = | \u03b2|. Furthermore, we will say that that the random variable (Z_1,\u03bb\u039b_1) follows a NIG-IG distribution with parameters (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03bc, \u03b4,\u03bb) (see Definition <ref> in the Appendix). Such distribution is  infinitely divisible because if ( X_1, Y_1 ), \u22ef, ( X_m, Y_m ) are independent NIG-IG random variables with common parameters ( \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bb) and individual ( \u03bc_i, \u03b4_i ), for i =1, \u22ef, m, then ( X, Y ) :=  ( \u2211_i=1^mX_i, \u2211_i=1^mY_i ) is again NIG-IG-distributed with parameters ( \u03b1, \u03b2, \u2211_i=1^m\u03bc_i, \u2211_i=1^m\u03b4_i, \u03bb).\n\n\n\nThe appellation NIG-IG for the couple (X,Y) in Definition\u00a0<ref> is justified as follows:\n  \n\n  * Y is an Inverse Gaussian process first derived by <cit.> which can be checked either by recovering the Inverse Gaussian distribution with parameters IG( \u03bb\u03b4/\u221a(\u03b1^2 - \u03b2^2), \u03bb\u03b4^2 ) after setting u=0 in (<ref>); or by using  the representation as a first passage-time in (<ref>). It is worth pointing that, \n for \u03b1 = |\u03b2|, one recovers the well-known L\u00e9vy distribution for the  first-passage of a Brownian motion  with parameters L\u00e9vy( 0, \u03bb\u03b4^2 ). The L\u00e9vy distribution can be seen as a special case of the Inverse Gaussian distribution. \n    \n  * X is the celebrated Normal Inverse Gaussian process of <cit.>, with parameters NIG( \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bc, \u03b4), which can be checked by setting v=0 in (<ref>) or by using the representation as subordinated Brownian motion with an Inverse Gaussian subordinator as in (<ref>).\n\n\nIn addition, we allow in Definition\u00a0<ref> the parameter \u03b1 to be equal to \u221e in the following sense:\n\n\nConsidering the set of parameters\n    \n    (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b4,\u03bc, \u03bb) =  ( \u03b1, 0, \u03c3^2 \u03b1, \u03bc, 1 ),\n\n    a second order Taylor expansion, as \u03b1\u2192\u221e, of the square root yields\n    \n    \ud835\udd3c[ exp( iu X_t + iv Y_t ) ] = exp( [ i \u03bc u - \u03c3^2 (u^2/2 + iv)] t ),    u, v \u2208\u211d,    t \u2264 T,\n\n    which is equivalent to the normal-deterministic process defined by\n    \n    ( X_t, Y_t )_t \u2208 [0,T] =  ( \u03bc t + \u03c3W_t, \u03c3^2 t )_t \u2208 [0,T]d=( \u03bc t + W_\u03c3^2 t, \u03c3^2 t )_t \u2208 [0,T].\n\nWe will consider that such (degenerate) process is a particular case of Definition\u00a0<ref> with parameters denoted by\n    \n    . ( \u03b1, 0, \u03c3^2 \u03b1, \u03bc, 1 )|_\u03b1\u2192\u221e.\n\n\n\n\nWe are now in place to state our main convergence theorem. Theorem\u00a0<ref> provides the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions of the joint process (log S^\u03f5, V\u0305^\u03f5)  through the  study of the limiting behavior of the  characteristic functional given in Theorem\u00a0<ref>. Interestingly, the limiting behavior disentangles three different asymptotic regimes based on the values of H that can be seen intuitively on the level of the Riccati equation (<ref>) as follows. Applying the variation of constants on \u03c8_\u03f5, we get:\n\n    \u03c8_\u03f5(t)     = \u03f5^H+1/2\u222b_0^t K_\u03f5(t-s) F(s,\u03c8_\u03f5(s)) ds,    t\u2264 T,\n    \n        F(s,u)     := \u03be^2/2 u^2 + \u03c1\u03be f(s) u + g(s) + f^2(s) - f(s)/2,\n\nwith K_\u03f5 the kernel defined by \n    K_\u03f5(t) =  \u03f5^-1 e^-\u03f5^-1t,     t\u2265 0.\n\nAssuming that \u03c8_\u03f5 converges to some \u03c8_0 and observing that K_\u03f5 plays the role of the Dirac delta as \u03f5\u2192 0, one expects \u222b_0^t K_\u03f5(t-s) F(s,\u03c8_\u03f5(s)) ds \u2192 F(t,\u03c8_0(t)) in (<ref>), the  pre-factor \u03f5^H+1/2 suggests then  three different limiting regimes with respect to H that can be characterized through the functions F  and  \u03c8_0: \n\n    \u03c8_0(t) = 0,      H>-1/2,   \n    \u03c8_0(t)= F(t,\u03c8_0(t)),    (\u03c8_0(t))\u2264 0,      H=-1/2,   \n    \n         0 = F(t,\u03c8_0(t)),          (\u03c8_0(t))\u2264 0,       H<-1/2.\n\nThe function  \u03c8_0 in (<ref>) is even explicitly given by \n\n    \u03c8_0(t)=  \n        0,       H>-1/2,   \n    \u03be^-2( 1 - \u03c1\u03be f(t) - \u221a(( 1 - \u03c1\u03be f(t) )^2 - 2 \u03be^2 ( g(t) + f^2(t)-f(t)/2))),      H=-1/2,   \n    \n          - \u03be^-1( \u03c1 f(t) + \u221a(f(t) ( 1 - ( 1- \u03c1^2 ) f(t) ) - 2 g(t))),      H<-1/2,\n\nsee Lemma\u00a0<ref> below. Furthermore, the convergence of the integrated variance process is strengthened to a functional weak convergence on the Skorokhod space  (D(0,T), M_1) of c\u00e0dl\u00e0g paths on [0,T] endowed with the strong M_1 topology, see Section\u00a0<ref> below. Such topology is weaker and less restrictive than the commonly used uniform or J_1 topologies which share the property that a jump in a limiting\nprocess can only be approximated by jumps of comparable size at the same time or, respectively, at nearby times. On the contrary, the M_1 topology of <cit.> captures approximations of unmatched jumps, which in our case, will allow us to prove the convergence of the stochastic process V\u0305^\u03f5  with continuous sample trajectories towards a L\u00e9vy process with c\u00e0dl\u00e0g sample trajectories. The statement is now made rigorous in the following theorem.\n\n\n    Let f,g:[0,T]\u2192\u2102 be bounded and measurable such that f =  g = 0 and such that \u03c8_0 defined in (<ref>) has bounded variations. Then, based on the value of H, we obtain different explicit asymptotic formulas for the characteristic functional given in Theorem\u00a0<ref>:\n    \n    lim_\u03f5\u2192 0\ud835\udd3c[ exp(\u222b_0^T f(T-s) dlogS^\u03f5_s + \u222b_0^T g(T-s) d V\u0305_s^\u03f5) ]=exp( \u03d5_0(T)),\n\n    with \n     \n    \u03d5_0(T) := \n        V_0 \u222b_0^T h(s) ds,       H>-1/2,   \n    ( \u03b8 + V_0 ) \u03be^-2( T - \u222b_0^T ( \u03c1\u03be f(s) + \u221a(( 1 - \u03c1\u03be f(s))^2 - 2 \u03be^2 h(s))) ds ),      H=-1/2, \n    \n        -\u03b8\u03be^-1\u222b_0^T ( \u03c1 f(s) + \u221a(\u03c1^2 f^2(s) - 2 h(s))) ds,       H<-1/2,\n\nwhere h(s): =g(s)+ f^2(s)-f(s)/2.\nIn particular for \u03c1\u2208 (-1,1), as \u03f5\u2192 0,   the finite-dimensional distributions of the joint process (logS^\u03f5/S_0,V\u0305^\u03f5) converge to the finite-dimensional distributions of a NIG-IG process (X,Y) in the sense of Definition\u00a0<ref> with the following parameters depending on the value of H:\n \n    (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b4,\u03bc, \u03bb) := .( \u03b1, 0, V_0 \u03b1, - V_0/2, 1 )|_\u03b1\u2192\u221e,        H>-1/2, \n    ( 1/2\u221a((\u03be-2\u03c1)^2 + 4(1-\u03c1^2))/\u03be (1-\u03c1^2), -1/2\u03be - 2 \u03c1/\u03be( 1 - \u03c1^2 ), \u221a(1-\u03c1^2) (\u03b8+V_0)\u03be^-1, - \u03c1(\u03b8 + V_0) \u03be^-1, 1/1-\u03c1^2) ,      H=-1/2, \n    ( 1/2(1-\u03c1^2), - 1/2(1-\u03c1^2), \u221a(1-\u03c1^2)\u03b8\u03be^-1, - \u03c1\u03b8\u03be^-1, 1/1-\u03c1^2),       H<-1/2,\n\nwhere \u03b8, S_0, \u03be and V_0 are the same from (<ref>)-(<ref>). Furthermore, the process V\u0305^\u03f5 converges weakly  towards Y on the space (D(0,T), M_1), as \u03f5\u2192 0.\n\n  The  convergence of the characteristic functional in (<ref>) is established in Section\u00a0<ref> (Lemmas\u00a0<ref> and <ref>). This implies the convergence of the finite-dimensional  distributions of \n (log S^\u03f5,V\u0305^\u03f5) as detailed in Section\u00a0<ref>. Finally, the weak convergence of V\u0305^\u03f5 on ( D(0,T),M_1) is proved in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\nThe  interpretation of the convergence results becomes even more interesting when combined with Section\u00a0<ref>. In Section\u00a0<ref>, for H>-1/2,  the reversionary Heston model (log S^\u03f5, V\u0305^\u03f5) is constructed as a proxy of rough and hyper-rough Heston models.  Theorem\u00a0<ref> shows that the limiting regime for H>-1/2 is a (degenerate) Black-Scholes regime, cf.Remark <ref>, whereas,  for H\u2264 -1/2 one obtains the convergence of the reversionary regimes towards (non-degenerate) jump processes with distinct regimes between H=-1/2 and H<-1/2, see Corollary <ref> below. This suggests that jump models and (hyper-)rough volatility models are complementary, and do not overlap. For H>-1/2 the reversionary model can be interpreted as a proxy of rough and hyper-rough volatility models, while for H\u2264 -1/2 it can be interpreted as a proxy of jump models.   Jump models actually start at H=-1/2 (and below), the first value for which hyper-rough volatility models can no-longer be defined. \n\n\n\nIn Figures <ref> and <ref>, we plot respectively the convergence of the smiles and the skew of the reversionary Heston model (log S^\u03f5, V\u0305^\u03f5) for the case H=-1/2 towards the Normal Inverse Gaussian model. The volatility surface is obtained by applying Fourier inversion formulas on  the corresponding characteristic functions.  Similar to Figures\u00a0<ref> and <ref>, the graphs show that the fast parametrizations introduced in the Heston model  are able to reproduce very steep skews for the implied volatility surface. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case (f,g) = ( iu, iv ), with u, v \u2208\u211d, the asymptotic marginals of reversionary Heston expressed in Corollary <ref> below are obtained as a direct consequence of the convergence Theorem <ref>. \n\n \nBased on the value of H \u2208\u211d, the pair of normalized log price and integrated variance (logS^\u03f5_T/S_0, V\u0305^\u03f5_T ) has distinct asymptotic marginals as the reversionary time-scale \u03f5 goes to zero given by:\n\n    \n  * H>-1/2, i.e.\u00a0Black Scholes-type asymptotic regime (BS regime)\n    \n    \n    \ud835\udd3c[ iulog S^\u03f5_T/S_0 + ivV\u0305^\u03f5_T ] \u03f5\u2192 0\u27f6exp{ - V_0/2( u^2 - 2i ( v - u/2) ) T }.\n\n    \n    \n  * H=-1/2, i.e.\u00a0Normal Inverse Gaussian-type asymptotic regime (NIG regime)\n    \n    \n    \ud835\udd3c[ iulog S^\u03f5_T/S_0+ ivV\u0305^\u03f5_T ] \u03f5\u2192 0\u27f6exp{( \u03b8 + V_0 ) \u03be^-2( 1 - i \u03c1\u03be u -\u221a(( 1 - i \u03c1\u03be u )^2 - 2 \u03be^2 ( i v - u^2 + iu/2))) T }.\n\n    \n    \n  * H<-1/2, i.e.\u00a0Normal L\u00e9vy-type asymptotic regime (NL regime)\n    \n    \n    \ud835\udd3c[ iulog S^\u03f5_T/S_0 + ivV\u0305^\u03f5_T ] \u03f5\u2192 0\u27f6exp{ - \u03b8\u03be^-1(i \u03c1 u + \u221a(( 1 - \u03c1^2 ) u^2 - 2i ( v - u/2))) T }.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nIn Figure <ref>, we illustrate numerically the convergence of the characteristic function in all three regimes.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the section is dedicated to the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Convergence of the joint characteristic functional\n \n    \nIn this section we prove the convergence of the characteristic functional of (logS^\u03f5/S_0, V\u0305^\u03f5) as \u03f5 goes to 0 stated in Theorem\u00a0<ref>. For this, we fix \nf,g:[0,T]\u2192\u2102 bounded and measurable such that f = g = 0. We note that (<ref>) is trivially satisfied so that an application of Theorem\u00a0<ref>, with t=0, yields that \n\n    \ud835\udd3c[ exp(\u222b_0^T f(T-s) dlog S^\u03f5_s + \u222b_0^T g(T-s) d V\u0305_s^\u03f5) ] = exp( \u03d5_\u03f5(T) + \u03f5^1/2  - H \u03c8_\u03f5(T) V_0 ),\n\n    where (\u03d5_\u03f5,\u03c8_\u03f5) solve (<ref>)-(<ref>).\n  We start by showing that the second term in the exponential  \u03f5^1/2-H\u03c8_\u03f5 goes to 0 for any value of H\u2208 in the following lemma. \n   \nFor \u03f5>0, let \u03c8_\u03f5 be a solution  the time-dependent Ricatti ODE (<ref>) such that (\u03c8^\u03f5)\u2264 0 with   f, g:[0,T]\u2192\u2102  bounded and measurable functions such that f =  g = 0. Then, \n\n    | \u03c8_\u03f5(t) | \u2264 C \u03f5^H+1/2( 1 - e^- \u03f5^-1t),    t\u2264 T,\n\n    for some constant C independent of \u03f5. In particular, we have the uniform convergence\n    \n    lim_\u03f5\u2192 0sup_t\u2264 T\u03f5^1/2-H|\u03c8_\u03f5(t)| = 0,        H \u2208.\n\n\n\n \n The variation of constants applied to the differential equation (<ref>) yields:\n\n    \u03c8_\u03f5(t) = \u222b_ 0^t c_\u03f5(s)e^\u222b_s^t ( a_\u03f5\u03c8_\u03f5(u) + b_\u03f5(u) ) du ds,\n\nwith a_\u03f5, b_\u03f5, c_\u03f5 defined as in (<ref>).  Given that f and g are both bounded on [0,T], we fix C \u2265 0 such that | c_\u03f5(u) | \u2264 C \u03f5^H-1/2, u \u2264 T. Note that b_\u03f5 = - \u03f5^-1, having also ( \u03c8_\u03f5) \u2264 0 and a_\u03f5 > 0, we get the desired upper bound on the solution. The convergence result follows immediately.\n\n\n  \nThe first term \u03d5_\u03f5, however,  yields  different limits based on the value of H. Consequently, we will study in Lemma\u00a0<ref> the convergence of the following quantity\n\n    \u03d5_\u03f5 (t) = \u222b_0^t ( \u03b8 + \u03f5^-H-1/2 V_0 ) \u03c8_\u03f5(s) ds,\n\n for different regimes of H. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    We have the convergence\n \n    lim_\u03f5\u2192 0\u03d5_\u03f5(T) = \u03d5_0(T),\n\n where  \u03d5_0(T) is given by (<ref>).\n \n \n \nCase H>-1/2.\n    In this case, the solution \u03c8_\u03f5 converges uniformly to zero from the upper bound given in Lemma <ref> which, combined with the expression of F in (<ref>),  yields \n\n    lim_\u03f5\u2192 0 F(s,\u03c8_\u03f5(s))  = F(s,0) = g(s) + f^2(s) - f(s)/2,    s\u2264 T.\n    \n    Furthermore, integrating the variation of constants expression (<ref>) leads to\n    \n    \u222b_0^t \u03f5^-H-1/2\u03c8_\u03f5(u) du     = \u222b_0^t {\u222b_0^u K_\u03f5(u-s) F(s,\u03c8_\u03f5(s)) ds } du\n        = \u222b_0^t {\u222b_s^t K_\u03f5(u-s) du } F(s,\u03c8_\u03f5(s)) ds\n        = \u222b_0^t ( 1 - e^-\u03f5^-1(t-s)) F(s,\u03c8_\u03f5(s)) ds,\n\nwhere we used Fubini for the second equality as the integrated quantity is bounded and measurable.

There will be two subsections: first, in Section <ref> we recall briefly the definition of the Strong M1 (SM_1) topology as well as some associated convergence results, and then we prove the tightness of the integrated variance in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Reminder on the SM_1 topology and conditions for convergence\n \n\nWe recall succinctly key definitions and convergence theorems for the M_1 topology. We refer the reader to the key reference book <cit.> for more details.  For x \u2208 D, we define the thin graph of x as\n\n    \u0393_x := { (z,t) \u2208\u211d\u00d7[ 0, T ]: z \u2208[ x(t^-), x(t) ] },\n\nwhere, for t \u2208[ 0,T ], [ x(t^-), x(t) ] denotes the standard segment {\u03b1 x(t^-) + ( 1 - \u03b1)  x(t), 0 \u2264\u03b1\u2264 1 }, which is different from a singleton at discontinuity points of the c\u00e0dl\u00e0g sample trajectory x. We denote Disc(x) the set of such instants. Define on \u0393_x the strong order relation as follows: (z_1,t_1) \u2264(z_2,t_2) if either t_1<t_2 or t_1=t_2 and |x(t_1^-)-z_1| \u2264|x(t_1^-)-z_2|. Furthermore define a strong parametric representations of x as a continuous non-decreasing (with respect to the previous order relation) function ( x\u0302, r\u0302) mapping [ 0,1 ] into \u0393_x such that ( x\u0302(0), r\u0302(0) ) = ( x(0),0 ) and ( x\u0302(T), r\u0302(T) ) = ( x(T),T ). We say the component r\u0302 scales the time interval [ 0,T ] to [ 0,1 ] while x\u0302 time-scales x, and we denote by \u03a0_s(x) the set of all strong parametric representations of x. Finally, the strong M1 topology is the topology induced by the metric d_s defined as\n\n    d_s( x_1, x_2) := ( x\u0302^i, r\u0302^i) \u2208\u03a0_s(x^j), j=1,2inf{| x\u0302^1 - x\u0302^2| \u2228| r\u0302^1 - r\u0302^2| }.\n\n\n\nBelow we mention briefly five theorems in a row that eventually yields criteria to prove the desired convergence.\n\n\n    D := D([0,T], \u211d^+) endowed with the SM_1 topology is Polish, i.e.\u00a0metrizable as a complete separable metric space.\n\n\n\n    Let (S,m) be a metric space. If a subset A in \ud835\udcab(S) is tight, then it's relatively compact. On the other hand, if the subset A is relatively compact and the topological space is Polish, then A is tight.\n\n\nThe first two theorems ensure that, since (D,SM_1 ) is Polish, proving relative compactness of any family of probability measures on such space is sufficient to ensure the existence of a convergent sub-sequence. Finally the convergence of finite-dimensional laws allows to uniquely determine its limit as formulated in the following theorem.\n\n Let ( ( X_n)_n\u2208\u2115, X ) be random functions defined on a common filtered probability space ( \u03a9, ( \u2131_t )_t, \u2119). Then, X_n \u21d2 X in D for the SM_1 topology if the following conditions hold:\n\n        \n  * (X_n)_n\u2208\u2115 is tight with regards to the SM_1 topology.\n        \n  * The finite dimensional distributions of X_n converge to those of X on T_X, where:\n        \n    T_X := { t > 0, \u2119(t \u2208 Disc(X) ) = 0 }\u222a{T}.\n\n        \n    \n\n\nTo conclude this section, we recall a characterization of tightness for a sequence of probability measures.\n\n\nThe sequence of probability measures {\u2119_n }_n \u2265 1 on (D,SM_1) is tight if and only if:\n\n    \n  (i) \u2200\u03b5\u0305>0, \u2203 c < \u221e, \u2200 n \u2265 1, \u2119_n ( { x \u2208 D: ||x|| > c }) < \u03b5\u0305\n    \n  (ii) \u2200\u03b5\u0305>0, \u2200\u03b7 > 0, \u2203\u03b4>0, \u2200 n \u2265 1, \u2119_n ( { x \u2208 D: w'(x,\u03b4) \u2265\u03b7}) < \u03b5\u0305\n\nWhere we defined for x \u2208 D, t\u2208 [0,T] and \u03b4>0:\n\n    ||x||     := t \u2208 [0,T]sup |x_t|,\n    \n        w'(x,\u03b4)    := w(x,\u03b4) \u2228v\u0305(x,0,\u03b4) \u2228v\u0305(x,T,\u03b4) ,\n    \n        w(x,\u03b4)    := t \u2208 [0,T]sup w_S(x,t,\u03b4), \n    \n        w_S(x,t,\u03b4)    := 0 \u2228 t-\u03b4\u2264 t_1 < t_2 < t_3 \u2264 (t+\u03b4) \u2227 Tsup| x(t_2)-[ x(t_1), x(t_3)] |, \n    v\u0305(x,t,\u03b4)    := 0 \u2228 t-\u03b4\u2264 t_1 \u2264 t_2 \u2264 (t+\u03b4) \u2227 Tsup| x(t_1)-x(t_2) |.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Convergence of the integrated variance process\n\n\nWe already proved in Section <ref> the convergence of finite dimensional distributions as \u03f5 goes to zero of V\u0305^\u03f5 toward those of either the deterministic linear, or the Inverse Gaussian, or the L\u00e9vy process denoted Y depending respectively on the value of the Hurst index with L\u00e9vy exponent \u03b7(0,\u00b7) from (<ref>) with the respective parameters given in Theorem <ref>. Consequently, all that remains to prove is the tightness of the family of processes ( V\u0305^\u03f5)_\u03f5>0 for the SM_1 topology to get the desired convergence result as a direct consequence of Theorem <ref>. We will apply the characterization Theorem <ref> of tightness in SM_1 to conclude, and more precisely, we will see that the criteria of tightness within the SM_1 topology simplifies greatly for almost surely non-decreasing and continuous stochastic processes in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFix \u03b5\u0305> 0.
