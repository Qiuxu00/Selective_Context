This geometric setting can be found in two distinct and independent contexts. The first of these is the well-known construction due to Fefferman <cit.> that associates a non-degenerate or contact CR structure of hypersurface type to a conformal structure of Lorentzian signature on a canonical circle bundle. There are various approaches to the construction: in the original version, Fefferman shows how a conformal structure can be constructed from the standard K\u00e4hler structure on the complex space ^m+1 in which the CR hypersurface is embedded. Later formulations allow for the CR manifold (M,H,J) to be abstract, that is, not necessarily embeddable. Of particular relevance in this article is the construction due to Lee <cit.>, who showed that Fefferman's conformal structure lives on the total space of a circle bundle over (M,H,J), which is a certain quotient of the canonical bundle C over M. \u010cap and Gover <cit.> later substituted C for a certain root thereof, which allows them to work within the framework of parabolic geometry and tractor calculus. In all of these versions, one associates to each contact form \u03b8 a so-called Fefferman metric\n\t\n\t\n    g_\u03b8    = 4 \u03b8\u2299\u03c9^W_\u03b8 + h   ,\n\nwhere \u03c9^W_\u03b8 is the induced Weyl connection one-form compatible with \u03b8, and h is the (degenerate) metric induced from the Levi form of \u03b8. Conformally related contact forms yield conformal related Fefferman metrics. The conformal structure thus constructed is characterised by the existence of a null conformal Killing field, and the CR manifold is recovered as the leaf space of its space of integral curves.\n\n\tThere is no global Einstein metric in the Fefferman conformal class, and at best, there exists only local ones defined off two cross-sections of M\u2192M. Each such metric can be shown to arise from a so-called CR\u2013Einstein structure, which is determined by a certain complex density \u03c3 satisfying a system of CR invariant equations <cit.>. This density determines a contact form \u03b8, and thus a Fefferman metric g_\u03b8. Using \u03c3 to trivialise M\u2192M with local coordinate \u03d5, and off the sections \u03d5 = \u00b1\u03c0/2, the metric\n\t\n    g    = ^2 \u03d5\u00b7g_\u03b8  ,\n\n\nis Einstein. Rather disappointingly, a CR\u2013Einstein three-manifold is flat, i.e. locally CR equivalent to the Heisenberg group or the three-sphere, and this implies in turn that the Fefferman space is conformally flat <cit.>.\n\n\tThere is, however, another, less-known, story connecting three-dimensional CR manifolds to four-dimensional Lorentzian metrics, which goes back to the Golden Age of mathematical relativity. And more importantly, these metrics are exact solutions to the vacuum Einstein's field equations, which include Einstein metrics. These are said to be algebraically special, meaning that the Weyl tensor is algebraic degenerate. A theorem due to Golberg and Sachs <cit.> tells us that such a property is equivalent to the existence of a so-called non-shearing congruence of null geodesics, that is, a (local) foliation by curves generated by a null vector field k, which preserves the conformal structure along directions orthogonal to it. For our purpose, we also assume that the congruence is twisting, i.e. the orthogonal complement ot k is non-integrable.\n\t\n\t Viewed in this light, our local Fefferman\u2013Einstein metric is a special case, albeit conformally flat. But there are of course many other, non-conformally flat, algebraically special Einstein metrics. In local coordinates (u, \u03b6, \u03b6, r), broadly following <cit.>, they may be cast as\n\t\n\t\n    g    = 4 \u03f1\u00b7\u03c9\u2299\u03bb'_\u03c9 + 2 (r^2 + \u03f1^2)   \u00b7\u03c9^1\u2299\u03c9 ^1\u0305  .\n\n\twhere\n\t\n    \u03c9    = 1/2 \u03f1(\u1ee5 + Z \u03b6\u0323+ Z\u03b6)   ,    \u03c9^1     = \u03b6\u0323  ,    \u03bb'_\u03c9    = \u1e5b + W\u03c9^1 + W\u03c9^1 + U\u03c9  .\n\n\n\tHere, the coordinate r is an affine parameter along the null geodesics of the congruence defined by the null vector field k, and (u, \u03b6, \u03b6) are coordinates on the leaf space, with u real, and \u03b6 complex. The non-vanishing complex-valued function Z and real function \u03f1 are defined on M, and the one-forms \u03c9 and \u03c9^1 define the contact CR structure on the leaf space, with \u03c9\u0323= \u0131\u03c9^1 \u2227\u03c9^1\u0305\u03c9. The r-dependence of the complex-valued function W and real function U is fully determined by virtue of the algebraical degeneracy of the Weyl tensor and (a subset of) Einstein's field equations, the\tso-called reduced Einstein equations. This form of the metric has the advantage of being amenable to asymptotics analysis as shown in <cit.>.\n\t\n\tA more convenient form for these metrics was obtained by Lewandowski and Nurowski in <cit.>, who found that any algebraically special pure radiation metric can be cast in the form\n\t\n    g    = \u03f1^2 ^2 (\u03d5 - \u03d5 )\u00b7( 4 \u03b8\u2299\u03bb + 2 \u03b8^1 \u2299\u03b8^1\u0305)   ,\n\nwhere \u03d5 is an affine parameter along the geodesics of the congruence, the one-forms \u03b8 and \u03b8^1 define the CR structure on the leaf space M, with \u03b8\u0323= \u0131\u03b8^1 \u2227\u03b8^1, and \u03f1 and \u03d5 are smooth functions on M, but, as argued in <cit.>, both \u03f1 and \u03d5 can be eliminated by a rescaling of the contact form \u03b8 and a reparametrisation of the geodesics respectively. The components of the null one-form \u03bb all admit finite Fourier expansions in \u03d5, so their coefficients are functions on M. The coordinates \u03d5 and r from our previous form are related by the transformation r = \u03f1tan (\u03d5 - \u03d5). We can then see at once that each of the metrics (<ref>) and (<ref>) with (<ref>) live on a circle bundle with some cross-sections removed, and this strongly suggests that they only differ from each other by some `perturbation' semi-basic one-form \u03be, i.e. \u03bb = \u03c9^W_\u03b8 + \u03be, and one of the aims of this article will be to establish this fact formally. From the relation between the two coordinates r and \u03d5, we see that r \u2192\u00b1\u221e as \u03d5\u2192\u00b1\u03c0/2, so one can interpret the hypersurfaces where the metric g blows up as conformal infinity. To accommodate these singularity sets, we shall put Gover's notion of almost Einstein scale into good use. These are certain densities \u03c3 on M satisfying a conformally invariant second-order differential equation, which encapsulates the existence of an Einstein metric in the conformal class, but defined only off the singularity set of \u03c3, if non-empty.\n\nA by-product of the investigation of these non-shearing congruences of null geodesics, which is the focus of Lewandowski1990a,Hill2008 is the discovery of analytic properties of CR three-manifolds arising from some subset of Einstein's field equations: these concern the existence of CR function, of which Kerr's complex coordinate \u03b6 in (<ref>) is an example, or even the realisability of the CR manifold, under suitable conditions.\n\nMore recently, the authors of <cit.> revisited the work of Lewandowski1991,Hill2008 by focussing on a variant of Fefferman's construction, which admits non-conformally flat solutions of a certain subset of Einstein's field equations, and by appealing to Jacobowitz's work on the realisability of CR manifolds <cit.>. The present article will delve further into these ideas.\n\nFinally, many of the computations necessary to derive the present results were carried out by the author in arbitrary even dimensions in <cit.>. In dimensions greater than four, all Einstein metrics on Lorentzian conformal manifolds of even dimension admitting a twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics were found to be contained in a three-parameter family of metrics, which include the Taub\u2013NUT\u2013(A)dS metric. We shall return to these findings in a separate article.\n\n\nThe overall aim of the article is two-fold:\n\n\t\n  * To introduce and study CR invariant differential equations for contact CR manifolds, in connection with the existence of CR functions and the CR embeddability. These naturally occur in the investigation of algebraically special Einstein Lorentzian four-manifolds.\n\t\n  * To show that algebraically special Lorentzian four-manifolds with prescribed Ricci curvature can find a natural formulation in the context of Fefferman spaces. To be precise, these belong to the same conformal class as `perturbed' Fefferman metrics, i.e. they are of the form g = cos\u03d5\u00b7( g_\u03b8 + 4 \u03b8\u2299\u03be) where g_\u03b8 is a Fefferman metric for some contact form \u03b8, \u03be is a semi-basic one-form, determined by some CR data, and \u03d5 a local fibre coordinate arising from a distinguished trivialisation of the Fefferman bundle.\n\t\n\t\n\tWe presently outline the structure of the paper while highlighting its main results. Section <ref> gives a review of CR geometry in any odd dimensions, but new interpretations are also obtained in connection with realisability of contact CR structures. In particular, we recast two results due to Jacobowitz <cit.> in terms of solutions to a CR invariant second-order differential equation in Proposition\t<ref> and Theorem <ref>. In fact, this equation can be defined in terms of a so-called first BGG operator as pointed out in Remark <ref>. A non-linear analogue of this equation, which we term a Webster\u2013Weyl structure provides in dimension three a criterion for the existence of CR functions \u2014 Theorem <ref>. Theorem <ref> shows that this non-linear equation can always be `linearised' in a certain sense.\n\n\tSection <ref> contains a review of conformal geometry and so-called optical geometries which are at the heart of non-shearing congruences of null geodesics. In Definitions <ref> and <ref>, we introduce formal definitions of certain metrics with prescribed Ricci curvature, which we term weakly half-Einstein, half-Einstein and pure radiation metrics, and their almost Lorentzian scale analogues as generalisations of almost Einstein scales \u2014 Proposition <ref>.\n\t\n\tWe briefly recall the Fefferman construction in Section <ref>, and define their perturbation by a semi-basic form, which is shown in Lemma <ref> to arise from some CR data understood as a tuple of densities on the CR manifold.\n\t\n\tIn Section <ref>, we start our investigation of optical geometries with twisting non-shearing null geodesics in dimension four and their relation to perturbed Fefferman spaces. In particular, we prove Theorem <ref>, which can be summarised as follows:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLet (M,c) be a Lorentzian conformal four-manifold with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics K. Suppose that for any generator k of K, the Weyl tensor and the Bach tensor of c satisfy\n\t\t\t\n    (k,v,k,\u00b7)     = 0   ,    \n    (k,k)     = 0   ,\n\n\t\t\trespectively. Then (M,c) is locally conformally isometric to a perturbation of a Fefferman space over a contact CR three-manifold.\n\t\t\n\t\n\tIn Section <ref>, we investigate almost (weakly) half-Einstein and pure radiation scales on perturbed Fefferman spaces. Their zero set are shown to arise from a distinguished density on the CR base space \u2014 see Proposition <ref>. Next, in the same framework, Theorems <ref>, <ref> and <ref> show how various prescriptions on the Ricci curvature can be translated into CR invariant differential equations. They provide CR invariant articulations of the results of Lewandowski1990,Mason1998. Of interest is Proposition <ref>, which gives an alternative characterisation of algebraically special optical geometries as perturbed Fefferman spaces. Drawing from Section <ref>, we also recover the results of Lewandowski1990a,Hill2008 regarding CR realisability in Proposition <ref>, Theorems <ref> and <ref>. On that matter of realisability, Corollary <ref> adds new results in some specific cases of perturbed Fefferman spaces.\n\t\t\n\t\n\tIn Proposition\t<ref> of Section <ref>, we provide a detailed description of the Weyl tensor of an important class of perturbed Fefferman spaces in terms of weighted tensors on the base space. These are shown to satisfy algebraic conditions in the presence of an almost half-Einstein scale or an almost pure radiation scale in Propositions <ref> and <ref>. The asymptotic behaviour of the curvature at conformal infinity is examined Propositions <ref>, <ref> and <ref>.\n\n\t\n\tWe end the article with Section <ref> by commenting briefly on conformal symmetries and their interpretation in terms of CR invariant differential equations.\n\t\n\tFour appendices are included: Appendix <ref> contains some technical results regarding adapted coframes in dimension three, which are used in Section <ref>. In Appendices <ref> and <ref>, we provide computations of parts of the Bach tensor and the Ricci tensor used in Sections <ref> and <ref> respectively. In Appendix <ref>, we sketch how to recover the Debney\u2013Kerr\u2013Schild metric from our approach.\n\n\nAcknowledgments: The author would like to thank Rod Gover and Jerzy Lewandowski for helpful and stimulating conversations.

This means that the complexification ^H of H splits as ^H = H^(1,0)\u2295H^(0,1) where H^(1,0) and H^(0,1) are the rank-m \u0131-eigenbundle and -\u0131-eigenbundle of J respectively. When H^(1,0) is involutive, i.e. [H^(1,0),H^(1,0)] \u2282 H^(1,0), we refer to (M,H,J) as a CR manifold. The complex line bundle C := \u22c0^m+1(H^(0,1)) is known as the canonical bundle of (M,H,J). We refer to <cit.> for a review on the topic.\n\t\n\tA (complex) infinitesimal symmetry of H^(1,0) is a complex-valued vector field v on M that preserves the distribution H^(1,0) in the sense that _v w \u2282\u0393(H^(1,0)) for any w \u2208\u0393(H^(1,0)). An infinitesimal symmetry of (M,H,J) is a real vector field v on M that preserves H^(1,0). In particular, since it is real, it preserves H^(1,0) too. An infinitesimal symmetry v of either H^(1,0) or (H,J) is said to be transverse (to H), if it satisfies v \u03b8\u2260 0, for any \u03b8\u2208\u0393((H)).\n\t\n\t\n\t\tA complex infinitesimal symmetry of H^(1,0) as we have defined it is not an infinitesimal symmetry in the strict sense of the term since it does not generate a one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms preserving the CR structure unless it is real. Its geometric interpretation will be given in Jacobowitz Proposition <ref> below.\n\t\n\t\n\tReal hypersurfaces in ^m+1 are the prototypical examples of CR manifolds. Not every CR manifold arises in this way, but those that do are referred to as (locally) realisable or embeddable, in the sense that locally there exists an embedding from M to ^m+1 with the property that the bundle complex structure J on H is induced from the ambient complex structure on ^m+1.\n\n\n\t\n\tA CR function on (M, H,J) is a smooth complex-valued function f defined in the neighbourhood of a point of M that satisfies X(f) = 0 for any section X of H^(0,1). We shall say that a set of CR functions { f_1, \u2026 f_r} on some subset U\u2282M is independent if they satisfy\n\t\n    f\u0323_1 \u2227\u2026\u2227f\u0323_r \u2260 0   ,\n\nat every point, and strongly independent if they satisfy\n\t\n    f\u0323_1 \u2227f_1\u2227\u2026\u2227f\u0323_r \u2227f_r\u2260 0   ,\n\nat every point of U. Realisability is then equivalent to the existence of m+1 independent CR functions. We shall give further criteria for realisability below. Before that, we give the following criterion for the existence of a CR function:\n\t\n\t\tLocally, a CR manifold (M, H,J) admits a strongly independent CR function if and only if there exists a smooth complex-valued one-form \u03b1 annihilated by H^(0,1) such that \u03b1\u2227\u03b1\u0323= 0 and \u03b1\u2227\u03b1\u2260 0.\n\t\n\tMore precisely, one can find two non-vanishing smooth complex-valued functions w and z on M such that \u03b1 = w^-1\u1e93.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tLocally, a CR manifold (M, H,J) is realisable if and only if it admits a complex transverse infinitesimal symmetry of H^(1,0).\n\t\n\t\n\tThe existence of a (real) transverse infinitesimal symmetry of (M,H,J) is sufficient but not necessary for realisability.\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOn a realisable CR manifold of dimension 2m+1, the pullback of any holomorphic (m+1,0)-form from ^m+1 to M gives rise to a closed section of the canonical bundle. So realisability provides an abundance of such forms. However, a closed section of the canonical bundle does not guarantee realisability <cit.>, unless one has enough CR functions at disposal:\n\t\n\n\tLocally, a (2m+1)-dimensional CR manifold is realisable if and only if it admits m strongly independent CR functions and a closed section of the canonical bundle. \n\n\n\n\tIn dimension three, it follows that once we know that (M,H,J) admits a CR function, realisability becomes equivalent to the existence of a closed section of the canonical bundle.\n\t\n\nFor ease of reference, we summarise the various criteria for the realisability of a CR manifold below. Given the following statement on a CR manifold (M,H,J):\n\n\t\n  * there is a (real) transverse symmetry of (H,J);\n\t\n  * there is a (complex) transverse symmetry of H^(1,0);\n\t\n  * the CR structure is realisable;\n\t\n  * there are m+1 independent CR functions;\n\t\n  * there are m strongly independent CR functions and a closed section of C;\n\t\n  * there is a closed section of C;\n\nwe have that\n\n    (1)       \u27f9       (2)       \u27fa        (3)       \u27fa       (4)       \u27fa       (5)       \u27f9       (6)   .\n\n\n\n\tLocal sections of H^(0,1) can be interpreted as so-called Cauchy\u2013Riemann operators, sometimes called Lewy operators. CR functions thus correspond to smooth complex functions that lie in the kernel of all such operators. For a CR manifold embedded as a real hypersurface in complex space, these operators arise from the restriction of the standard Cauchy\u2013Riemann operators on ^m+1. We say that a Cauchy\u2013Riemann operator \u2202 is solvable at a point, if for each sufficiently smooth complex-valued function \u03be in its neighbourhood, there exists a complex-valued function z in a possibly smaller neighbourhood such that\n\t\n    \u03be = \u0131\u2202log z   .\n\nIn dimension three, even for realisable CR manifolds, there exists a \u03be for which there is no z solving (<ref>) <cit.>. In other words, the \u2202-Poincar\u00e9 Lemma does not hold in CR geometry in general.\n\n\t\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Contact CR structures\n\n We shall be mostly interested in the case where our CR manifold (M,H,J) is contact, that is, the distribution H is contact, i.e. maximally non-integrable in the sense that T M = H + [H,H]. This is particularly convenient as there is a well-developed theory of such geometries available <cit.>. We also assume M and H to be oriented. A choice of contact form \u03b8\u2208\u0393((H)) is referred to as a pseudo-hermitian structure in the present context. Its Levi form, that is, the restriction h of \u03b8\u0323 to H, has signature (p,q) with p+q=m, p positive, q negative eigenvalues. It provides a hermitian form on ^ H, and thus a bundle metric on H of signature (2p,2q). The Reeb vector field of \u03b8 is the unique vector field \u2113, satisfying \u03b8 (\u2113) = 1 and \u03b8\u0323 ( \u2113 , \u00b7 ) = 0. Since there is in general no preferred pseudo-Hermitian structure on (M,H,J), we obtain a subconformal structure c_H on H compatible with J.\n\t\nIt will be convenient to assume that the canonical bundle C admits a -1/m+2-th root, and define the line bundle E(1,0) := C^-1/m+2, its complex conjugate E(0,1) = E(1,0), dual  E(-1,0) :=  E(1,0)^*. More generally, we define CR density bundles E(w,w') := E(1,0)^w \u2297E(1,0)^w' for any w, w' \u2208 such that w - w' \u2208. By definition, it follows that E(w,w') = E(w',w).\n\nThere are  canonical sections \u03b8 of T^* M\u2297E(1,1) and h of (H^(1,0))^* \u2297 (H^(0,1))^* \u2297E(1,1) with the property that for each CR scale, that is, a (real) section 0 < s \u2208\u0393(E(1,1)), then \u03b8 = s^-1\u03b8 is a contact form with Levi form h = s^-1h. This reflects the fact that T M/H injects into E(1,1). The weighted Levi form h allows us to identify H^(1,0) with (H^(0,1))^*\u2297E(1,1) and H^(0,1) with (H^(1,0))^*\u2297E(1,1).\n\nOne can also understand the relation between CR scales and contact forms as follows: to each section \u03b6 of C = E(-(m+1),0), there is a unique contact form \u03b8 with Reeb vector field \u2113 for which \u03b6 is volume-normalised, i.e.\n    \u03b8\u2227 (\u03b8\u0323)^m     = \u0131^m^2 m!

Further, since a section \u03b5 of the canonical bundle is a density of weight of -m-2, choosing any -w/m+2-th root of \u03b5 for any w \u2208 yields a section of E(w,0). In particular, the structure equations (<ref>) together with (<ref>) gives a straightforward proof of the next result.\n\t\n\t\tLocally, a contact CR manifold admits a closed section of the canonical bundle if and only if it admits CR densities of weight (w,0) with 0 \u2260 w \u2208.\n\t\n\t\n\tNow, since any realisable (M,H,J) admits closed sections of C, we have:\n\t\n\t\tAny realisable contact CR manifold (M,H,J) admits CR densities of weight (w,0) for any w \u2208.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSince CR densities and CR functions are on the same footing, Jacobowitz's Theorem <ref> feels very natural in that respect: in this light, the closed section of the canonical bundle is just a CR density.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLee showed <cit.> that locally, the existence of a closed section of C is essentially equivalent to the existence of a so-called pseudo\u2013Einstein structure, that is, the existence of a contact form \u03b8 such that the Webster\u2013Schouten tensor is proportional to the Levi form (but not necessarily by a constant factor).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Complex infinitesimal transverse symmetries\n\n\tIt is straightforward to check that for any density \u03c3 of weight (1,w), w \u2208, the equation\n\t\n    \u2207_\u03b1\u2207_\u03b2\u03c3 + \u0131_\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3    = 0   ,\n\nis CR invariant.\n\n\n\tIn the language of parabolic geometries, the solution \u03c3 lies in the kernel of a so-called first Bernstein\u2013Gel'fand-Gel'fand (BGG) operator <cit.> \u2014 see also for instance <cit.>, especially Section 8.2 there for the case m=1. For w\u22650, the operator occurs as part of a resolution of an irreducible (m+1,1)-representation.\n\n\nIn the case where w=1, the geometric interpretation of its solutions is given in the next proposition.\n\t\n\t\tAny solution \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,1)) to (<ref>) is equivalent to the existence of a complex infinitesimal transverse symmetry of H^(1,0).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn a local adapted frame (\u2113, e_\u03b1, e_\u03b1\u0305), a vector field v on (M,H,J) can be expressed as\n\t\t\n    v     = v^0\u2113 + v^\u03b1 e_\u03b1 + v^\u03b1\u0305e\u0305_\u03b1\u0305  ,\n\n\t\tfor complex v^0\u2208\u0393(E), v^\u03b1\u2208\u0393(E^\u03b1) and v^\u03b1\u0305\u2208\u0393(E^\u03b1\u0305). Note we are not assuming that v^\u03b1\u0305 is the complex conjugate of v^\u03b1 in general. A straightforward computation shows that v preserves H^(1,0), i.e. _v e_\u03b1\u2208\u0393(H^(1,0)), if and only if\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    v_\u03b1 - \u0131\u2207_\u03b1 v^0    = 0   , \n    \u2207_\u03b1 v_\u03b2 + \u0131_\u03b1\u03b2    = 0   .\n\n\t\t\n\t\tThe condition that v be transverse to H means that v^0 is non-vanishing. Setting \u03c3 := v^0 s where s is the CR scale preserved by \u2207, we see that \u03c3 satisfies (<ref>).\n\t\t\n\t\tThe converse is clearly true: let \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,1)) be a solution of (<ref>), choose a CR scale s with Webster connection \u2207, and set v^0 := \u03c3 s^-1. Then v^0 is non-zero, and v_\u03b1 := \u0131\u2207_\u03b1 v^0 satisfies (<ref>) by virtue of (<ref>). Define v := v^0 \u2113 + v^\u03b1 e_\u03b1 + v^\u03b1\u0305e_\u03b1\u0305 for any choice of section v^\u03b1 of E^\u03b1. Then \u03c3 yields a complex transverse symmetry of H^(1,0).\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn the special case where a density \u03c3 of weight (1,1) is real, i.e. \u03c3 is a CR scale, and solves (<ref>), then the Reeb vector field defined by \u03c3 is an infinitesimal transverse symmetry of (M,H,J). Note that in this case the assumption that (H,J) is contact forces the symmetry of (H,J) to be transverse. We shall nevertheless retain the terminology. Such solutions have already been investigated in e.g. <cit.> in the context of deformations of (almost) CR structures.\n\t\t\n\t\tOn the other hand, the correspondence between complex densities of weight (1,1) satisfying (<ref>) and complex transverse symmetries is not one-to-one in general, since the (1,0)-part of the latter is completely arbitrary. This is to be expected since H^(1,0) is involutive. Thus if one solution exists, so do infinitely many.\n\t\n\t\n\tIn the context of contact CR manifolds and in the light of Proposition <ref>, we can re-express Jacobowitz's Proposition <ref> in the following terms: \n\t\n\t\tLocally, a contact CR manifold (M,H,J) is realisable if and only if it admits a solution \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,1)) to  (<ref>). \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Webster\u2013Weyl structures\n\n\t\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 General odd dimensions\n\nIn this section, we introduce a CR invariant structure that may be thought of as a non-linear analogue to (<ref>), and will play a key r\u00f4le in the subsequent sections. We start with a simple lemma, whose proof follows from the transformation rule (<ref>) of the Webster torsion tensor.\n\t\n\t\tLet \u2207 and \u2207 be two Webster connections on a contact CR manifold (M,H,J) related by (<ref>). Then a section \u03bb_\u03b1 of E_\u03b1 is a solution to\n\t\t\n    \u2207_(\u03b1\u03bb_\u03b2) -  \u0131\u03bb_\u03b1\u03bb_\u03b2  - _\u03b1\u03b2    = 0   ,\n\n\t\tif and only if \n\t\t\n    \u03bb_\u03b1 = \u03bb_\u03b1 + \u0131\u03a5_\u03b1  ,\n\n\tis a solution to\n\t\n    \u2207_(\u03b1\u03bb_\u03b2) -  \u0131\u03bb_\u03b1\u03bb_\u03b2  - _\u03b1\u03b2    = 0   .\n\n\t\n\n\nConsidering the close resemblance of (<ref>) to the Einstein\u2013Weyl equation, we make the following definition.\n\t\n\t\tA Webster\u2013Weyl structure on (M,H,J) is an equivalent class [\u2207_\u03b1,\u03bb_\u03b1] of pairs (\u2207_\u03b1,\u03bb_\u03b1), where \u2207_\u03b1 is a (partial) Webster connection and \u03bb_\u03b1\u2208\u0393(E_\u03b1), with the property that these satisfy the Webster\u2013Weyl equation (<ref>), and (\u2207_\u03b1, \u03bb_\u03b1) \u223c (\u2207_\u03b1,\u03bb_\u03b1) whenever \u2207_\u03b1 and \u2207_\u03b1 related by (<ref>), and \u03bb_\u03b1 and \u03bb_\u03b1 by (<ref>).\n\t\n\n\n\t It is not difficult to check that equation (<ref>) for a real density \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,1)) is a particular case of (<ref>) where, for every choice of representative [\u2207_\u03b1,\u03bb_\u03b1], we have that \u03bb_\u03b1 = \u0131\u2207_\u03b1\u03c8 for some real smooth function \u03c8 on M. In particular, there is a representative for which \u03bb_\u03b1 = 0, which tells us that the Reeb vector field corresponding to \u03c3 is an infinitesimal symmetry of (M,H,J).\n\n\nThere is an analogue of equation (<ref>), closely related to (<ref>) for gauged partial connections: Let \u03be\u2207_\u03b1 be a partial Webster connection gauged by some \u03be_\u03b1\u2208\u0393(E_\u03b1). Then\n\n    \u03be\u2207_(\u03b1\u03be\u2207_\u03b2)\u03c3 + \u0131_\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3    = 0   ,\n\nis a well-defined CR invariant on densities of weight (1,w). In fact, CR invariance simply follows from the following easy observation:\n\n\tSuppose that \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,w)) for any w \u2208 is a solution to (<ref>). Then\n\t\n    \u03bb_\u03b1 = \u0131\u03c3^-1\u03be\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3 = \u0131\u03c3^-1\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3 + \u03be_\u03b1  ,\n\nsatisfies the Webster\u2013Weyl equation (<ref>).\n\nConversely, suppose that \u03bb_\u03b1 solves (<ref>). Fix some \u03c3\u2208E(1,w), w \u2208, and define a partial gauge \u03be_\u03b1\u2208\u0393(E_\u03b1) by (<ref>). Then \u03c3 satisfies (<ref>).\n\nThus, we can interpret equation (<ref>) in three different ways:\n\n\t\n  * as an equation on the density \u03c3 for \u03be_\u03b1 fixed;\n\t\n  * as an equation on the partial gauge \u03be_\u03b1 for \u03c3 fixed;\n\t\n  * as an equation on the pair (\u03c3, \u03be_\u03b1) subject to the freedom (<ref>) since by Lemma <ref>, it leaves \u03bb_\u03b1 as defined by (<ref>) unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\nA consequence of Lemma <ref> is the following:\n\n\tFor any non-vanishing complex-valued function z, any solution \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,0)) to (<ref>) yields a solution z \u03c3 to (<ref>) where the partial gauge is given by \u03be_\u03b1 =\u0131\u2207_\u03b1log z.\n\t\n\tSuppose that \u03be_\u03b1 = \u0131\u2207_\u03b1log z for some non-vanishing complex-valued function z. Then any solution to (<ref>) gives rise to a solution to (<ref>).\n\n\nOnce a solution to (<ref>) is known for some gauge, it is easy to produce more by using CR densities of weight (1,0) as `raising' or `lowering' operators:\n\nSuppose that (M,H,J) admits a CR density \u03c4 of weight (w,0) for some w \u2208 Z. Then any solution s of weight (1,w') to (<ref>) for some w' \u2208 Z gives rise to a solution \u03c3=s \u03c4^-1 of weight (1,w'-w) to (<ref>).\n\n\nIt thus follows from Lemmata <ref> and <ref> that for realisable (M,H,J), densities of weight (1,0) that satisfies (<ref>) exists in plentiful. We note that the geometric interpretation of a solution to (<ref>) crucially depends on the weight of the density since in general only weight (1,1) implies realisability. However, Jacobowitz's Theorem <ref> already hints at a way to remedy this issue.\n\n\tLocally, a contact CR manifold (M,H,J) is realisable if and only if it admits two densities \u03c3 and \u03c4 of weight (1,0) that satisfy\n\t\n\t\n    \u2207_\u03b1\u2207_\u03b2\u03c3 + \u0131_\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3    = 0   , \n    \u2207_\u03b1\u0305\u03c4    = 0   ,\n\n\nrespectively.\n\n\n\n\tSuppose that (M,H,J) is realisable. Then Lemma <ref> provides a solution \u03c4 to (<ref>), and Proposition <ref> provides a solution to (<ref>). Hence, by Lemma <ref> we obtain a solution to (<ref>).\n\t\n\tConversely, we apply Lemma <ref> to our solutions \u03c3 and \u03c4 to (<ref>) and (<ref>) respectively, to produce a solution \u03c3\u03c4^-1\u2208\u0393(E(1,1)) to (<ref>). Realisability then follows by Proposition <ref>.\n\n\n\n\nIn the special case, where \u03c4=\u03c3 in Theorem <ref>, the pair of equations (<ref>) and (<ref>) define what is referred to as an (almost) CR\u2013Einstein structure in <cit.>. In this case, the solution \u03c3 defines a pseudo-hermitian structure \u03b8 for which\n\n    _\u03b1\u03b2    = 0   ,    ( \u03a1_\u03b1\u03b2\u0305)_\u2218    = 0   ,    \u2207_\u03b1\u03a1    = 0   .\n\nIn dimension three, any solution thereof immediately tells us that (M,H,J) is CR\u2013flat.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Dimension three\n\nHenceforth, we assume that (M,H,J) has dimension three. Then the tensor product of any number of copies of H^(1,0) and H^(0,1) is of rank 1, so symmetrisation is a vacuous operation, and we have that H^(1,0)\u2297H^(0,1)\u2245E(1,1), since for any A^\u03b1\u2208\u0393(E^\u03b1), B^\u03b1\u0305\u2208\u0393(E^\u03b1\u0305), we can write A^\u03b1B^\u03b2\u0305 = A^\u03b3B_\u03b3h^\u03b1\u03b2\u0305. While the use of indices, which concretely only take the numerical value 1, may appear to be of rather limited utility, they turn out to be extremely useful for book keeping and ultimately makes the geometric interpretation of our computations much more transparent, and the relation to the general case more direct.\n\nWe now return to the problem of characterising the existence of a CR function. \tLet us choose an arbitrary local adapted coframe (\u03b8, \u03b8^\u03b1, \u03b8^\u03b1\u0305) on (M,H,J) with dual (\u2113,e_\u03b1,e_\u03b1\u0305).

This choice picks out a representative ((\u03b8)\u2207_\u03b1,(\u03b8)\u03bb_\u03b1) of [\u2207_\u03b1,\u03bb_\u03b1]. We now return to equation (<ref>), and to emphasise the dependence on the choice of frame, we adorn the geometric quantities with (\u03b8)\u00b7. Then \u03c9\u0323^1 = 0 implies that\n\t\n\t\t\n    (\u03b8)\u2207_\u03b2\u0305(\u03b8)\u03bb^\u03b1 + \u0131(\u03b8)\u03bb_\u03b2\u0305(\u03b8)\u03bb^\u03b1 - (\u03b8)^\u03b1_\u03b2\u0305    = 0   , \n    (\u03b8)\u0393_\u03b2\u0305\u03b3^\u03b3 + \u0131(\u03b8)\u03bb_\u03b2\u0305    = 0   , \n    \n       - (\u03b8)\u0393_0 \u03b3^\u03b3\u03b4_\u03b2^\u03b1 - e_\u03b2( (\u03b8)\u03bb^\u03b1 ) + (\u03b8)\u03bb^\u03b3\u0305(\u03b8)\u0393_\u03b3\u0305\u03b4^\u03b4\u03b4_\u03b2^\u03b1 +  \u0131(\u03b8)\u03bb^\u03b1(\u03b8)\u03bb_\u03b2    = 0   .\n\n\n\tClearly, equation (<ref>) is vacuous. By (<ref>), equation (<ref>) tells us that (\u03b8)\u03bb_\u03b1\u0305 = 3 \u0131\u03c3^-1(\u03b8)\u2207_\u03b1\u0305\u03c3 for some density \u03c3 of weight (1,0) such that \u03c3^-3 = \u03b8\u2227\u03b8^1 and \u03b8 = (\u03c3\u03c3)^-1\u03b8. However, this expression depends on the coframe, and thus on the choice of connection. To resolve this issue, we note that since (\u03b8)\u2207(\u03c3\u03c3) = 0, we can write\n\t\n    (\u03b8)\u03bb_\u03b1    =  \u0131\u03c3^-1(\u03b8)\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3 - 2 \u0131\u03c3^-1(\u03b8)\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3 = \u0131\u03c3^-1\u03c3^2 (\u03b8)\u2207_\u03b1 (\u03c3\u03c3^-2 )  .\n\n\tThis new expression gives the appropriate transformation for (\u03b8)\u03bb_\u03b1 under a change of contact form. In particular, it does not depend on the particular choice of representative of [\u2207_\u03b1, \u03bb_\u03b1], and we can safely drop the adornment (\u03b8)\u00b7, thereby establishing (<ref>). We can now recast (<ref>) as (<ref>). Plugging now (<ref>) into (<ref>) yields (<ref>).\n\t\n\t\n\tFinally, we note that if z is some non-zero complex-valued function that satisfies \u2207_\u03b1\u0305 z = 0 (so z is a CR function) and \u2207_0 z - \u03bb^\u03b1\u2207_\u03b1 z = 0, the one-form \u03c9^1 = z \u03c9^1 is also exact with a CR potential. Rescaling \u03c3 as in (<ref>) yields a unitary adapted coframe of the first kind (\u03b8, \u03b8^1, \u03b8^1\u0305) where \u03b8 = z z\u03b8 and \u03b8^1 = z \u03b8^1 + \u03a5^1\u03b8. Carrying out the analysis as before, we find that\n\t\n    \u03bb_\u03b1    = \u0131\u03c3^-1\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3 - 2 \u0131\u03c3^-1\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3  ,\n\n\tand we may verify for consistency that \u03bb_\u03b1 = \u03bb_\u03b1 + \u0131\u03a5_\u03b1.\n\n\n\nTheorem <ref> tells us that we obtain an equivalence class of densities related by (<ref>), for which the solution \u03bb takes the form (<ref>). Each of these densities singles out a connection \u2207 in which the connection one-form component \u0393_\u03b1\u03b2\u0305^\u03b2\u0305 in the associated adapted coframe can be identified with \u0131\u03bb_\u03b1. This falls short of a distinguished connection, but nevertheless partially mimics the behaviour of Einstein\u2013Weyl structure in the conformal setting.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhile Theorem <ref> singles out a family of unitary adapted coframes, and in particular, of contact forms, in the context of CR functions, these might not be the most convenient ones when it comes to geometric structures. Indeed, a local transverse symmetry determines a unique contact form \u03b8 for which the Reeb vector field is its generator. But in general, there will be no admissible unitary coframe (\u03b8^1) such that \u03b8^1 = \u1e89 where w is a CR function.\n\t\n\t\n\tWe end this section by an application of Theorem <ref>, which weakens the assumptions of Theorem <ref> in dimension three:\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLocally, a contact CR three-manifold (M,H,J) is realisable if and only if it admits two densities \u03c3 and \u03c4 of weight (1,0) that satisfy\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    \u03be\u2207_\u03b1\u03be\u2207_\u03b2\u03c3 + \u0131_\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3    = 0   , \n    \u03be\u2207_\u03b1\u0305\u03c4    = 0   ,\n\n\t\t\n\twhere \u03be\u2207_\u03b1 = \u2207_\u03b1 + \u03be_\u03b1 for some gauge \u03be_\u03b1\u2208\u0393(E_\u03b1).\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tWe work locally. Suppose that \u03c3 and \u03c4 solve (<ref>) and (<ref>) respectively. Then \u03bb_\u03b1 = \u0131\u03c3^-1\u03be\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3 satisfies the Webster-Weyl equation (<ref>), and so by Theorem <ref>, there exists a density \u03c3 of weight (1,0) such that\n\t\t\n    \u03bb_\u03b1    = \u0131( \u03c3^-1\u03c3^2) \u2207_\u03b1( \u03c3\u03c3^-2)   ,\n\n\t\tand it immediately follows that\n\t\t\n    \u03be_\u03b1    = \u0131\u03f1^-1\u2207_\u03b1\u03f1  ,\n\n\tWe shall now produce a CR density with the data provided.\n\t\tDefine \u03c4' = \u03f1^-1\u03c4\u2208\u0393(E(3,0)). Since, by assumption, (<ref>) holds, \u2207_\u03b1\u0305\u03c4 =  \u0131\u03be_\u03b1\u0305\u03c4 and \u2207_\u03b1\u0305\u03f1 =  \u0131\u03be_\u03b1\u0305\u03f1, and so\n\t\t\n    \u2207_\u03b1\u0305\u03c4'\n    \t\t\t    = \u2207_\u03b1\u0305( \u03f1^-1\u03c4) \n        = ( \u2207_\u03b1\u0305\u03f1^-1) \u03c4  + \u03f1^-1( \u2207_\u03b1\u0305\u03c4) \n        = - \u0131\u03be_\u03b1\u0305\u03f1\u03f1^-2\u03c4  + \u0131\u03be_\u03b1\u0305\u03f1^-1\u03c4 = 0   .\n\n\t\tHence, \u2207_\u03b1\u0305\u03c4' = 0, and thus, by Theorem <ref>, (M,H,J) is locally realisable.\n\t\t\n\t\tThe converse is immediate.\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\u00a7 CONFORMAL GEOMETRY\n\n\tLet (M, c) be an oriented and time-oriented conformal smooth manifold of dimension four and of Lorentzian signature (+,+,+,-). Two metrics g and g belong to the conformal class c if and only if\n\t\n    g    = ^2  \u03c6g  ,\n\n\tFollowing <cit.>, for each w \u2208, there are naturally associated density bundles denoted E[w], and the Levi-Civita connection of g extends to a linear connection on E[w]. In particular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between metrics in c and sections of the bundle of conformal scales, denoted E_+[1], which is a choice of square root of E[2]. The correspondence is achieved by means of the conformal metric g, which is a distinguished non-degenerate section of ^2 T M\u2297E [2]: if \u03c3\u2208E_+[1], then g = \u03c3^-2g is the corresponding metric in c. We shall refer to such a non-vanishing density as a Lorentzian scale. The Levi-Civita connection \u2207 of g also preserves \u03c3, and it follows that g is preserved by the Levi-Civita connection of any metric g in c.  We thus have a canonical identification of T M with T^* M\u2297E [2] via g.\n\t\n\t\n\tWe shall often use the abstract index notation, whereby sections of T M, respectively, T^* M will be adorned with upper, respectively, lower minuscule Roman indices starting from the beginning of the alphabet, e.g.  v^a \u2208\u0393(T M), and \u03be_a b\u2208\u0393(\u22c0^2 T^* M). Symmetrisation will be denoted by round brackets, and skew-symmetrisation by square brackets, e.g. \u03bb_[a b] = 1/2( \u03bb_a b - \u03bb_b a) and \u03bb_(a b) = 1/2( \u03bb_a b + \u03bb_b a). In particular, we will write E_[a_1 \u2026 a_k] for the k-th exterior power of the cotangent bundle \u22c0^k T^* M, and E_(a_1 \u2026 a_k) for its k-th symmetric power ^k T^* M.  Its tracefree part ^k_\u2218 T^* M will by denoted  E_(a_1 \u2026 a_k)_\u2218.\n\t\n\tBy convention, we take the Riemann tensor of a given metric g_a b in c to be defined by\n\t\n    2 \u2207_[a\u2207_b]\u03b1_c     = - _a b^d_c\u03b1_d   ,    \u03b1_a \u2208\u0393(E_a[w])   .\n\n\tIt decomposes as\n\t\n    _a b c d    = _a b c d + 4 g_[a|[c\u03a1_d]|b]  ,\n\n\twhere _a b c d is the conformally invariant Weyl tensor and \u03a1_a b the Schouten tensor, which is related to the Ricci tensor _a b = _c a^c_b and the Ricci scalar = _a^a by\n\t\n    \u03a1_a b    = 1/2( _a b - /6g_a b)   .\n\n\tThe Schouten scalar is defined to be \u03a1 := \u03a1_a bg^a b = 1/6. One construct the Cotton tensor and the Bach tensor as\n\t\n    _a b c    = 2 \u2207_[b\u03a1_c] a  , \n    _a b    = - \u2207^c_a b c + \u03a1^c d_a c b d  ,\n\nrespectively. The former vanishes whenever g is an Einstein metric, while the latter is a conformally invariant obstruction to the existence of an Einstein metric. By the Bianchi identities, we have\n\t\n    _a b c = \u2207^d _d a b c  .\n\n\n\tFor any two metrics g and g in c related by (<ref>), their respective Levi-Civita connections \u2207 and \u2207 are related by\n\n    \u2207_a \u03b1_b     = \u2207_a \u03b1_b + (w - 1) \u03a5_a \u03b1_b - \u03a5_b \u03b1_a + \u03a5_c \u03b1^c g_a b  ,    \u03b1_a \u2208\u0393(E_a[w])\n\nwhere \u03a5_a := \u2207_a \u03c6. The Schouten tensor, Schouten scalar and Cotton tensor transform as\n\n    \u03a1_a b     = \u03a1_a b - \u2207_a\u03a5_b + \u03a5_a\u03a5_b - 1/2\u03a5^c\u03a5_cg_a b  ,    \u03a1     = \u03a1 - \u2207^a\u03a5_a - \u03a5^c\u03a5_c  , \n    _a b c    = _a b c + \u03a5^d _d a b c  ,\n\nrespectively. \t\n\t\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Non-shearing congruences of null geodesics\n\n\tWe briefly review some notions that have been introduced and studied variously in <cit.>. We shall refer to a null line distribution K on (M,c) as an optical structure, and the triple (M,c,K) as an optical geometry. The orientation and time-orientation on (M,c) induces an orientation on K. It is a subbundle of its orthogonal complement  K^\u22a5 with respect to c, i.e. K\u2282K^\u22a5\u2282 T M, and the screen bundle H := K^\u22a5 / K of K inherits a conformal structure of Riemannian signature from c.\n\t\n\tSince H has rank two it admits a bundle complex structure J, and thus a splitting ^H = H^(1,0)\u2295H^(0,1) into the eigenbundles of J. One can show that there is a unique complex rank-two distribution N, totally null with respect to c, such that ^K = N\u2229N and N / ^K = H^(0,1). Conversely, any totally null complex rank-two distribution arises in this way. We refer to the pair (N,K) as the almost Robinson structure associated to K.\n\t\t\n\tAny non-vanishing section k of K generates a congruence of null curves K tangent to K. These curves are oriented since K is oriented. The local leaf space M of K inherits geometric structures from (M,c,K) under certain conditions. The weakest of all is when the curves of K are geodesics, that is,\n\t\t\n    _k\u03ba  (v)      = 0   ,    v   \u2208\u0393(K^\u22a5)   .\n\n\t\twhere \u03ba = g (k,\u00b7) for some metric g in c. This means that H descends to a rank-two distribution H on M.\n\t\t\n\tWe shall suppose that in addition,  K is non-shearing,\n\t\t that is, the conformal structure on H is preserved along the flow of k, i.e.\t\t\n    _kg (v , w )     = \u03f5g (v , w )    ,    v, w\u2208\u0393(K^\u22a5)   ,\n\n\t\tfor some smooth function \u03f5. Then H inherits a bundle conformal structure from H, and thus a bundle complex structure J. In fact, the property that K is non-shearing is equivalent to the associated almost Robinson structure (N,K) being involutive, in which case we refer to (N,K) as a Robinson structure. The subbundle H^(1,0) descends to the \u0131-eigenbundle H^(1,0) of J. This makes (M,H,J) a CR three-manifold.\n\t\n\t\tOur last requirement will be that K is twisting, i.e. K^\u22a5 is non-integrable: for any generator k and any metric g in c, the one-form \u03ba = g (k,\u00b7) satisfies\n\t\t\n    \u03ba ( v , w)    \u2260 0   ,    v, w   \u2208\u0393(K^\u22a5)   .\n\n\t\tBy virtue of (<ref>), the leaf space (M,H,J) of K is then a contact CR three-manifold.\n\n\nFor a congruence of null curves, the properties regarding the geodesy, shear and twist are all conformally invariant and do not depend on the choice of generator of K. The next question that we need to address is how metrics in c are related to contact forms for (M,H,J). To this end, we shall use the following canonical structures arising from our geometric setup <cit.>:\n\n\t\n  * There is a conformal subclass n.e.c of metrics in c with the property that whenever g is in n.e.c, the congruence K is non-expanding, i.e.\t\n    _kg (v , w )     = 0    ,    v, w   \u2208\u0393(K^\u22a5)   ,\n\n\tAny two metrics in n.e.c differ by a factor constant along K.\n\t\n  * From the twisting property of K, there is a distinguished generator k of K with the property that for any metric g in n.e.c, we have that\n\t\n    \u03ba    = g(k,\u00b7) = 2 \u03b8  ,\n\n\twhere \u03b8 is a contact form for (H,J)\n\nThanks to k and n.e.c, we obtain a `tight' relation between (M,c,K) and the leaf space (M,H,J) of K. To be precise, there is a one-to-one correspondence between metrics in n.e.c and contact forms for (H,J). Further, each metric g_\u03b8 in n.e.c associated to some contact form \u03b8 takes the form\n\n\n    g_\u03b8    = 4 \u03b8\u2299\u03bb + h   ,\n\nwhere h is (the metric induced from) the Levi form of \u03b8, and \u03bb is a unique null one-form satisfying k\u03bb = 1. Choosing an admissible coframe (\u03b8^\u03b1) for \u03b8, and an affine parameter \u03d5 along the geodesics of k so that k=\u03d5, we can write\n\n    h     = 2 h_\u03b1\u03b2\u0305\u03b8^\u03b1\u2299\u03b8^\u03b2\u0305  ,    \u03bb    = \u03d5\u0323+ \u03bb_\u03b1\u03b8^\u03b1 + \u03bb_\u03b1\u0305\u03b8^\u03b1\u0305 + \u03bb_0 \u03b8^0   ,\n\n\nfor some complex-valued functions \u03bb_\u03b1 and \u03bb_\u03b1\u0305=\u03bb_\u03b1, and real function \u03bb_0 on on M. Differentiation with respect to \u03d5 will be denoted by a dot, i.e. \u1e1f := _kf for any smooth tensor-valued function f on M, and this notation will be extended to tensor components.\n\nAny other choice of metric g_\u03b8 = ^\u03c6g_\u03b8 in n.e.c for some smooth function \u03c6 on M is given by\n\n    g_\u03b8    = 4 \u03b8\u2299\u03bb + h  ,\n\n\twhere\n\n    \u03b8    = 1/2g_\u03b8(k, \u00b7) = ^\u03c6\u03b8  , \n    h    = ^\u03c6( h - 2 \u0131\u03a5_\u03b1\u03b8^\u03b1\u2299\u03b8 + 2 \u0131\u03a5_\u03b1\u0305\u03b8^\u03b1\u0305\u2299\u03b8 + 2 \u03a5_\u03b1\u03a5^\u03b1\u03b8\u2299\u03b8)   , \n    \u03bb    = \u03bb + 1/2\u0131\u03a5_\u03b1\u03b8^\u03b1 - 1/2\u0131\u03a5_\u03b1\u0305\u03b8^\u03b1\u0305 - 1/2\u03a5_\u03b1\u03a5^\u03b1\u03b8  ,\n\nwith (\u03b8^\u03b1) being admissible for (H,J,\u03b8), and \u03a5_\u03b1 = \u2207_\u03b1\u03c6. On the other hand, a change of affine parametrisation\n\n    \u03d5\u21a6\u03d5'= \u03d5 - \u03d5  ,\n\nfor some smooth function \u03d5 on M accompanied with the redefinition\n\n    \u03bb'_\u03b1    = \u03bb_\u03b1 + \u2207_\u03b1\u03d5  ,    \u03bb'_0    = \u03bb_0 + \u2207_0\u03d5  ,\n\npreserves the form of the metric (<ref>) and clearly the vector field k=\u2202/\u2202\u03d5'.\n\nWe shall henceforth denote an optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics by the triple (M,c,k). The perturbed Fefferman spaces to be introduced in Section <ref> are a special case of these.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Almost Einstein scales and generalisations\n\nRecall that a metric g in c is said to be Einstein if its Ricci tensor satisfies\n\n    = \u039bg  ,\n\nfor some constant \u039b. In the context of optical geometries, one can make further definitions whereby the Einstein condition is weakened.\n\t\n\t\tLet (M,c,K) be an optical structure with associated almost Robinson structure (N,K). We say that a metric g in c is:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n  * a weakly half-Einstein metric if its Ricci tensor satisfies\n\t\t\n    _a bv^a v^b     = 0   ,\n\n\t\t\t\t\n  * a half-Einstein metric if it is weakly half-Einstein and has constant Ricci scalar curvature;\n\t\t\t\t\n  * a pure radiation metric if it is half-Einstein and the tracefree part of the Ricci tensor satisfies\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    \u03ba_[a( _b] c)_\u2218    = 0   ,\n\n\t\ti.e.\t\t\n    _a b    = \u039bg_a b + \u03a6\u03ba_a\u03ba_b  ,\n\n\tfor some constant \u039b and smooth function \u03a6 on M.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\tFor our considerations, these conditions are somewhat too strong. For this reason, and motivated by the notion of almost pseudo-Riemannian structure in <cit.>, we make the following definition:\n\t\n\t\tLet \u03c3 be a section of E[1] with zero set Z. We say that \u03c3 is an almost Lorentzian scale if \u2207_a\u03c3\u2260 0 on Z where \u2207 is the Levi-Civita connection of some (and thus any) metric in c. \n\t\n\tThat this definition does not depend on the choice of metric, follows from the transformation rule \u2207_a\u03c3 = \u2207_a\u03c3 + \u03a5_a\u03c3, and the fact that the second term vanishes on Z. The density \u03c3 defines a metric g = \u03c3^-2g in c, but regular only off Z.\n\t\n\tFirst introduced by Gover in <cit.> \u2014 see also <cit.> \u2014 an almost Einstein scale is an almost Lorentzian scale \u03c3 that satisfies the conformally invariant equation\n\n    ( \u2207_a\u2207_b\u03c3 + \u03a1_a b\u03c3)_\u2218 = 0   .\n\nIf \u03c3 has empty zero set Z, then it is referred to as an Einstein scale, and it defines a (global) Einstein metric. Otherwise, if Z is non-empty, then off Z, the metric g = \u03c3^-2g is Einstein. A useful interpretation of Z is as the conformal infinity of some Lorentzian Einstein manifold \u2014 see <cit.> for more details.\n\n\n\nWe can readily generalise this idea to the metrics introduced in Definition <ref>.\n\t\n\tLet \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E[1]) on an optical geometry (M,c,K) with associated almost Robinson structure (N,K).

Then\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  * \u03c3 is an almost weakly half-Einstein scale if and only if g is a weakly half-Einstein metric;\n\t\t\t\n  * \u03c3 is an almost half-Einstein scale if and only if g is a half-Einstein metric;\n\t\t\t\n  * \u03c3 is an almost pure radiation scale if and only if g is a pure radiation metric.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThroughout \u2207^(g) will denote the Levi-Civita connection preserving g, so that for any other connection \u2207, \u2207 = \u2207^(g) + \u03a5 where \u03a5 = \u03c3^-1\u2207\u03c3. We first prove the implication \u21d2 for each of the cases, working off the zero set of \u03c3:\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  * Suppose \u03c3 satisfies (<ref>). Multiplying (<ref>) through by \u03c3^-1 and using the transformation rule for the Schouten tensor (<ref>), we find ( ^(g)_a b)_\u2218 = 1/2\u03a6_a b, and comparing (<ref>) with (<ref>) tells us that g is a weakly half-Einstein metric.\n\t\t\t\n  * Suppose that \u03c3 satisfies (<ref>) in addition to (<ref>). By case (1), we already know g is weakly half-Einstein metric. We proceed to check that its scalar curvature is constant. Multiplying (<ref>) through by \u03c3^-1 gives the transformation rule\n\t\t\t\n    \u2207^(g)_b\u03a6_a^b    = \u2207_b\u03a6_a^b + 2 \u03a5_b\u03a6_a^b  .\n\n\t\t\tThe right-hand-side is zero by virtue of (<ref>). On the other hand, we have (^(g)_a b)_\u2218 = \u03a6_a b, and the contracted Bianchi identity tells us that\n\t\t\t\n    \u2207_a^(g)    = 4 \u2207^(g)_b\u03a6_a^b = 0   ,\n\n\t\t\ti.e. ^(g) is constant, which makes g a half-Einstein metric.\n\t\t\t\n  * Suppose that \u03a6_a b satisfies (<ref>), in addition to \u03c3 being a solution to (<ref>). Then clearly (<ref>) follows from (<ref>).\n\t\t\n\nFor the converse direction, if we assume that the metric g defined by \u03c3 is weakly half-Einstein off the zero set Z of \u03c3, then choosing \u2207 to preserve \u03c3 tells us that (<ref>) is satisfied off Z . But (<ref>) clearly holds on Z too. Thus \u03c3 is an almost weakly-Einstein scale. The remaining cases are similar.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Principal null directions and Petrov types of the Weyl tensor\n\nLet (M, c,K)  be a four-dimensional optical geometry. We first assume that c is not conformally flat, i.e. the Weyl tensor  is nowhere zero. We shall adapt a number of definitions from mathematical relativity to the present setting \u2014 see <cit.> for details. We say that K is a\nprincipal null direction (PND) of the Weyl tensor  if\n\n    (k,v,k,v)     = 0   ,\n\nand it is said to be repeated if it satisfies\n\n    (k,v,k,\u00b7)     = 0   ,\n\nFurther degeneracy conditions are possible, namely,\n\t\n    (k,v,w,\u00b7)     = 0   ,    \n    (k,\u00b7,\u00b7,\u00b7)     = 0   ,\n\nIn this case, we refer to a PND K as\n\n\t\n  * simple if it satisfies (<ref>) but not (<ref>),\n\t\n  * double if it satisfies (<ref>) but not (<ref>),\n\t\n  * triple if it satisfies (<ref>) but not (<ref>),\n\t\n  * quadruple if it satisfies (<ref>) and \u2260 0.\n\n\nOn the other hand, at any point of a four-dimensional non-conformally flat Lorentzian conformal manifold (M,c), the Weyl tensor always determines at most four distinct PND, and thus locally, at most four distinct optical structures. The multiplicity of each of these PNDs form the basis of the Petrov classification of the Weyl tensor  <cit.>. We say that  is algebraically special if it admits a repeated PND, and algebraically general otherwise. In more details, now allowing for conformal flatness, it is said to be\n\n\t\n  * of Petrov type I if  does not admit any repeated PNDs,\n\t\n  * of Petrov type II if  admits a single double PND,\n\t\n  * of Petrov type D if  admits a pair of distinct double PNDs,\n\t\n  * of Petrov type III if  admits a triple PND,\n\t\n  * of Petrov type N if  admits a quadruple PND,\n\t\n  * of Petrov type O if  is identically zero.\n\nIt is a standard result that if K is a non-shearing congruence of null geodesics, then K is a PND of the Weyl tensor. Another important result is the so-called Goldberg\u2013Sachs theorem <cit.>, which in the present context, can be formulated in these terms:\n\n\tLet (M,c) be a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold that admits an almost Einstein scale. Then the Weyl tensor is algebraically special if and only if it admits a non-shearing congruence of null geodesics.\n\nWe omit the proof, which is similarly to that of Theorem <ref> below. There are variations of this theorem, and for our purpose, we shall need the following reformulation of a result due to <cit.>.\n\n\tLet (M,c,K) be an optical structure with non-shearing congruence of null geodesics that admits an almost weakly half-Einstein scale. Then K is a repeated PND of the Weyl tensor.\n\n\n\n\tBy hypothesis, the almost weakly half-Einstein scale \u03c3 defines a weakly half-Einstein metric g off the zero set Z of \u03c3. By Theorem 5.9 of <cit.>, we already know that off Z, K is a repeated PND of the Weyl tensor. This property smoothly extends to Z.\n\nOf course, the Weyl tensor may degenerate further on the zero set, as will be investigated in Section <ref>.\n\nWe end this section by introducing some notation. Let (M,c,K) be an optical geometry with congruence of null curves K and associated almost Robinson structure (N,K). For a given choice of metric in c, it is convenient to choose an frame (e_0, e_\u03b1,e_\u03b1\u0305,e^0) adapted to (N,K), that is\n\n    g(e_0 , e^0)     = 1   ,    g(e_1 , e^1)     = 1   ,\n\nand all other pairings zero. Set\n\n    \u03a8_0     := _\u03b1^0_\u03b2^0  ,    \u03a8_1     := ^0_\u03b1^0_0  ,    \u03a8_2     := _\u03b1 0^\u03b1 0  ,    \u03a8_3     := _0 \u03b1_0^0  ,    \u03a8_4 := _\u03b1 0_\u03b2 0  .\n\nWe shall now assume that K is geodesic and non-shearing (so that \u03a8_0 = 0), and in addition that K is a repeated PND, so that\n\n    \u03a8_0 = \u03a8_1 = 0   .\n\nWe suppose further that K is non-twisting. Referring to the setup of Section <ref>, we choose two metrics g and g in n.e.c, so that the corresponding change of adapted frames induces the change\n\n    \u03a8_2     = \u03a8_2   ,     \t(\u03a8_3)_\u03b1    = (\u03a8_3)_\u03b1 - 3/2\u0131\u03a5_\u03b1\u03a8_2   ,     \t(\u03a8_4)_\u03b1\u03b2    = (\u03a8_4)_\u03b1\u03b2 + 2 \u0131\u03a5_\u03b1 (\u03a8_3)_\u03b2 - 3/2\u03a5_\u03b1\u03a5_\u03b2\u03a8_2   .\n\nHere, we have adjoined abstract indices to \u03a8_3 and \u03a8_4 to emphasize the transformation laws.\n\nThe table below characterises the remaining possible Petrov types in terms of the \u03a8_i defined in (<ref>):\n\n\n\t \n\t\tPetrov type      Conditions on \u03a8_i \n [0.5ex] \n\t\tD     4 (\u03a8_3)^2 - 6 \u03a8_2 \u03a8_4 = 0 \n \n\t\tIII     \u03a8_2 = 0 \n\n\t\tN     \u03a8_2 = \u03a8_3 = 0 \n\n\t\tO     \u03a8_2 = \u03a8_3 = \u03a8_4 = 0 \n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE FEFFERMAN CONSTRUCTION AND ITS VARIANTS\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Fefferman spaces\n\nIn this section, we follow the approach of <cit.> closely. Let (M,H,J) be a contact CR three-manifold. The bundle E(-1,0) with its zero-section removed is a principal bundle with structure group ^*, and taking its quotient by the natural _>0-action yields a circle bundle M over M. The projection from E(-1,0) with its zero section removed to M sends a density \u03c4 of weight (-1,0) to an equivalence class [\u03c4], where \u03c4, \u03c4' \u2208 [\u03c4] if and only if \u03c4 = \u03f1\u03c4' for some positive real function \u03f1 on M. Let us fix a contact form \u03b8. We then have a natural identification of sections of M with volume-normalised densities of weight (-1,0) via (<ref>). Thus, choosing a non-vanishing section \u03c4\u2208\u0393(E(-1,0)) yields a trivialisation of M such that \u03b8 = \u03c4\u03c4\u03b8, and we may define a fibre coordinate \u03d5\u2208 [ - \u03c0, \u03c0) such that ^\u0131\u03d5\u03c4 is a section of M. The Fefferman metric associated to \u03b8 is the Lorentzian metric on M given by\n\n    g_\u03b8    = 4 \u03b8\u2299( \u03d5\u0323+ \u0131/2( \u03c3^-1\u2207\u03c3 - \u03c3^-1\u2207\u03c3) - 1/3\u03a1\u03b8) + h   ,\n\nwhere \u03c3 = \u03c4^-1\u2208\u0393(E(1,0)), and h is the degenerate metric induced by the Levi form of \u03b8. One can conveniently eliminate \u03c3 by noting that since \u03c3 determines \u2207, we have that \u2207(\u03c3\u03c3) =0, i.e. \u03c3^-1\u2207\u03c3 = - \u03c3^-1\u2207\u03c3. Using (<ref>), we can also easily recover the more familiar form of the Fefferman metric in terms of the connection one-form:\n\n    g_\u03b8    = 4 \u03b8\u2299( \u03d5\u0323+ 1/3( \u0131\u0393_\u03b1^\u03b1 - \u0131/2 h^\u03b1\u03b2\u0305\u1e25_\u03b1\u03b2\u0305 - \u03a1\u03b8) ) + h   .\n\nNote the following:\n\n\t\n  * Since, for any other section \u03c4' = ^\u0131\u03d5\u03c4, the corresponding change of coordinate is \u03d5' = \u03d5 - \u03d5, the expression (<ref>) does not depend on the choice of trivialisation \u03c3.\n\t\n  * Under a change of contact form \u03b8 = ^\u03c6\u03b8 for smooth function \u03c6 on M, the metric transforms conformally as g_\u03b8 = ^\u03c6g_\u03b8.\n\nWe therefore have a conformal class of Fefferman metrics in c. Further, c admits a canonical conformal Killing field k, i.e. _kg = 0, namely the generator k = \u2202/\u2202\u03d5 of the fibers of M\u2192M. In fact, it is Killing for each of the Fefferman metrics in c, i.e. _kg_\u03b8 = 0 for any contact form \u03b8 for (H,J). We shall refer to (M,c,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J) as the Fefferman space of (M,H,J).\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Perturbed Fefferman spaces\n\nWe generalise the Fefferman conformal structure as follows.\n\n\n\tLet (M,c,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J) be a Fefferman space. Let \u03be be a semi-basic one-form on M, that is, k\u03be = 0. Given a Fefferman metric g_\u03b8 in c, we define the Fefferman metric perturbed by \u03be as\n\t\n    g_\u03b8,\u03be    = g_\u03b8 + 4 \u03b8\u2299\u03be  .\n\n\tThis naturally extends to a conformal structure c_\u03be, which we refer to as the Fefferman conformal structure perturbed by \u03be, and we call \u03be the perturbation one-form of (M,c,k), and the triple (M,c_\u03be,k) as a perturbed Fefferman space.\n\n\nThe next straightfoward result encapsulates the issue at stake in this article.\n\n\tWith respect to the conformal structure c_\u03be, the vector field k generates a twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics. It is conformal Killing if and only if k\u03be = 0.\n\n\nSince \u03be lives on a circle bundle, its components can be Fourier expanded, and in fact, the Fourier coefficients should be understood as trivialised CR densities as the lemma below makes clear.

We refer the reader to Section <ref> for the general setup and notation concerning these geometries. In addition, since a perturbed Fefferman metric is in particular a special case of an optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics, it will be convenient to write\n\n    g_\u03b8,\u03be    = 4 \u03b8\u2299\u03bb + h   ,    \u03bb    := \u03c9_\u03b8 - 1/3\u03a1\u03b8 + \u03be  ,\n\nwhere \u03c9_\u03b8 is the induced Webster connection one-form on M with Schouten tensor \u03a1. Just as we did in Lemma <ref>, we can Fourier expand the components of \u03bb with respect to an adapted coframe.\n\nWe start with a technical lemma.\n\n\tLet (M,c,k) \u03d6\u27f6 (M,H,J) be an optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics. Let g_\u03b8\u2208n.e.c for some contact form \u03b8 so that it is given by (<ref>). Suppose that\n\n    \u03bb_\u03b1    = \u2211_k \u2208I\u03bb_\u03b1^(k)^k \u0131\u03d5  ,    \u03bb_\u03b1\u0305    = \u2211_k \u2208I\u03bb_\u03b1\u0305^(-k)^-k \u0131\u03d5  ,    \u03bb_0    = \u2211_k \u2208 - J\u222aJ\u03bb_0^(k)^k \u0131\u03d5  ,\n\nfor some I\u2282, J\u2282_\u22650. Then (M,c,k) is locally conformally isometric to a perturbed Fefferman space (M',c'_\u03be,k') \u27f6 (M,H,J) with perturbation one-form \u03be determined by the CR data (\u03be_\u03b1^(i), [\u2207,\u03be_0^(j)] )_i \u2208I, j \u2208J, where for each choice of trivialisation \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,0)) of M, we have\n\n\t\n    \u03bb_\u03b1^(0)    = \u0131\u03c3^-1\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3 + \u03be_\u03b1^(0)  ,    \u03bb_0^(0)    = \u0131\u03c3^-1\u2207_0\u03c3 + \u03be_0^(0) - 1/3\u03a1  ,    \n    \u03bb_\u03b1^(k)    =  \u03be_\u03b1^(k)  ,    \u03bb_0^(k)    =  \u03be_0^(k)  ,     k \u2260 0   .\n\n\nwhere \u03be_\u03b1^(i) and \u03be_0^(j) are given by (<ref>).\n\n\n\n\tSince (M,H,J) is a contact CR three-manifold, we associate to it its conformal Fefferman space (M',c',k') \u03d6'\u27f6 (M,H,J). To the contact form \u03b8, we have an associated Webster connection \u2207 with induced connection one-form \u03c9_\u03b8 on M', and a corresponding Fefferman metric g'_\u03b8 in c'.\n\t\n\tNext, choose a non-vanishing density \u03c3 of weight (1,0) such that \u03b8 = (\u03c3\u03c3)^-1\u03b8 and denote by \u03d5' the corresponding fibre coordinate on M' \u2192M. The map that sends a point p in M to (\u03d6(p) , ^\u0131\u03d5\u2218\u03d6(p) \u03c3^-1 ) in M' is a bundle map \u03b9 from (M,c,k) to (M',c',k'): clearly \u03d6' \u2218\u03b9 = \u03d6, and any change of affine parametrisation of k of the form \u03d5 = \u03d5 - \u03d5 induces a change of trivialisation as \u03c3 = ^-\u0131\u03d5\u03c3, so \u03b9 does not depend on the choice of trivialisation.\n\t\n\tLet us now write\n\t\n    \u03c9_\u03b8    := \u03c9_\u03b8 - \u03d5\u0323= \u0131\u03c3^-1\u2207\u03c3 - 1/3\u03a1\u03b8  ,\n\n\tand define\n\t\n    \u03be_\u03b1^(0)    = \u03bb_\u03b1^(0) - \u0131\u03c3^-1\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3  ,    \u03be_0^(0)    = \u03bb_0^(0) - \u0131\u03c3^-1\u2207_0\u03c3 + 1/3\u03a1  ,    \n    \u03be_\u03b1^(k)    = \u03bb_\u03b1^(k)  ,    \u03be_0^(k)    = \u03bb_0^(k)  ,     k \u2260 0   .\n\nIt is then straightforward to check that under an affine reparametrisation of the geodesics of k and a change of contact form, the induced transformations of \u03be_0^(k) and \u03be_0^(k) allow us to view them as the trivialisations of some CR data (\u03be_\u03b1^(i), [\u2207,\u03be_0^(j)] )_i \u2208I, j \u2208J. We can therefore define a perturbation one-form \u03be from this CR data, and an associated perturbed Fefferman metric\n\n    g'_\u03b8,\u03be    := g'_\u03b8 + 4 \u03b8\u2299\u03be  .\n\nOne can also verify that under a change of contact form, the metrics thus constructed rescale by the same conformal factor. Checking that \u03b9 is a conformal isometry that sends each metric g_\u03b8 in n.e.c to a perturbed Fefferman metric g'_\u03b8,\u03be, is routine. In particular, \u03b9_* k|_p = k'|_\u03b9(p) at every point p of M.\n\n\nWe shall use Lemma <ref> in Proposition <ref>, Theorem <ref> and Proposition <ref> to relate twisting non-shearing congruences of null geodesics to perturbed Fefferman spaces. As a first step, we have:\n\n\nLet (M,c,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics.

Condition (<ref>) is equivalent to \u03a8_1 = 0 in the notation of Section <ref>. This can be seen to be equivalent to the second-order linear ordinary differential equation \u03bb\u0308_\u03b1 + 2 \u0131\u03bb\u0307_\u03b1 = 0, which has general solution (<ref>).\n\n\nApplying Lemma <ref> to a perturbed Fefferman space gives:\n\n\tLet (M,c_\u03be,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional perturbed Fefferman space. Then \u27e8k\u27e9 is a repeated PND of the Weyl tensor of c_\u03be if and only if the perturbation one-form \u03be is determined by some CR data ( \u03be_\u03b1^(-2),  \u03be_\u03b1^(0), [\u2207,\u03be_0^(k)] )_k \u2208I for some subset I\u2282_\u22650.\n\n\nStarting from the hypotheses of Lemma <ref>, further assumptions are needed in order to fully integrate out the dependence of the metric on the fibre coordinate. We start with a stronger constraint on the Weyl curvature.\n\n\tLet (M,c,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics.

Condition (<ref>) clearly implies (<ref>), so we know by Lemma <ref> that the component \u03bb_\u03b1 is given by (<ref>). \n\t\n\tWe proceed to show that under the assumption (<ref>), the component \u03bb_0 takes the form\n\t\n    \u03bb_0    = \u03bb_0^(-2)^-2 \u0131\u03d5 + \u03bb_0^(0) + \u03bb_0^(2)^2 \u0131\u03d5  ,\n\n\twhere \u03bb_0^(0) and \u03bb_0^(\u00b1 2) are smooth functions on M, with \u03bb_0^(0) = \u03bb_0^(0) and \u03bb_0^(2) = \u03bb_0^(-2). Using Appendix A of <cit.>, we compute the component \u03a8_2 of the Weyl tensor, as defined in Section <ref>, under the assumption (<ref>). For convenience, we separate the real and imaginary parts of \u03a8_2.

Differentiating (<ref>) = 0 with respect to \u03d5, and substituting the resulting expression for \u03bb\u0308_0 into (<ref>) = 0, we can immediately solve for \u03bb_0 algebraically, and find that it takes the form (<ref>), where\n\t\t\n    \u03bb_0^(0)    = \u0131\u2207_\u03b1\u03bb^\u03b1_(0) -   \u0131\u2207^\u03b1\u03bb_\u03b1^(0) \n    \t\t\t+ 3 \u03bb^\u03b1_(2)\u03bb_\u03b1^(-2)   \n    \t\t\t+ \u03a1  , \n    \u03bb_0^(2)    = \u0131\u2207_\u03b1\u03bb^\u03b1_(2) + 2 \u03bb_\u03b1^(0)\u03bb^\u03b1_(2)  .\n\nNext, we use the relations (<ref>) and the commutation relation (<ref>), multiply the resulting expressions by \u03c3\u03c3 and \u03c3^-2 respectively, and using (<ref>), we arrive at (<ref>) and (<ref>) respectively. To complete the proof, we simply apply Lemma <ref>.\n\n\n\n\tWe note that both \u03be_0^(0) and \u03be_0^(2) transform as (<ref>) as required.\n\n\t\n\n\n\nIn the present context, the condition that the Weyl tensor is of Petrov type III or more degenerate has the following conformally invariant consequence:\n\n\n\t\tLet (M,c,k) be a four-dimensional optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics.

The line of arguments follows that of the proof of Proposition <ref>. In particular, condition (<ref>) already tells us that \n\u03bb_\u03b1 is given by (<ref>). We proceed to show that condition (<ref>) forces the coefficient \u03bb_0 to take the form\n\n    \u03bb_0    = \u03bb_0^(-4)^-4 \u0131\u03d5 + \u03bb_0^(-2)^-2 \u0131\u03d5 + \u03bb_0^(0) + \u03bb_0^(2)^2 \u0131\u03d5 + \u03bb_0^(4)^4 \u0131\u03d5  ,\n\nwhere \u03bb_0^(2k), |k|=0,1,2, are smooth functions on M, real for k=0, complex for k \u2260 0. \n\nBy Proposition <ref>, we already know that this is true with \u03bb_0^(4) = 0 when \u27e8k\u27e9 is a triple PND of , and Lemma <ref> tells us that this is consistent with (<ref>). Let us now assume that \u27e8k\u27e9 is a double PND of . This means that the component \u03a8_2 of  defined in (<ref>) is not zero. Using (<ref>) and (<ref>) and taking further derivatives with respect to \u03d5, and plugging the resulting expressions into (<ref>), we find that condition (<ref>) is equivalent to the fourth-order linear ordinary differential equation\n\t\n    \u20dc\u03bb_0 + 20 \u03bb\u0308_0 + 64 \u03bb_0     = 64 ( \u0131\u2207_\u03b1\u03bb^\u03b1_(0) -   \u0131\u2207^\u03b1\u03bb_\u03b1^(0) \n    \t\t+ 3 \u03bb^\u03b1_(2)\u03bb_\u03b1^(-2)   \n    \t\t+ \u03a1)   ,\n\n\ton \u03bb_0. The general solution is given by (<ref>) where\n\t\n    \u03bb_0^(0)    = \u0131\u2207_\u03b1\u03bb^\u03b1_(0) -   \u0131\u2207^\u03b1\u03bb_\u03b1^(0) \n    \t\t+ 3 \u03bb^\u03b1_(2)\u03bb_\u03b1^(-2)   \n    \t\t+ \u03a1  ,\n\n\tand \u03bb_0^(-2), \u03bb_0^(-4) are arbitrary complex-valued functions on (M,H,J). The end of the proof is just as that of Proposition <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISTINGUISHED ALMOST LORENTZIAN SCALES\n\nIn contrast with Section <ref>, we now investigate the consequences of the existence of the distinguished almost Lorentzian scales that we introduced in Section <ref>.\n\n\tLet (M,c,k) \u03d6\u27f6 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics. Then in the neighbourhood U of any point, we can always find an almost Lorentzian scale \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E[1]) that satisfies \n\t\n    k^ak^b( \u2207_a\u2207_b\u03c3 + \u03a1_a b\u03c3)     = 0   ,\n\nand whose zero set Z consists of the union of sections of \u03d6: U\u2192U := \u03d6 (U) \u2282M parametrised by the integers .\n\nMore specifically, there exists an affine parameter \u03d5 along the geodesics of k, unique up to transformations \u03d5\u21a6\u03d5 + k \u03c0 for any k \u2208 such that\n\n    Z = {\u03d5 = 2 k + 1/2\u03c0 | k\u2208}  ,\n\nand a unique contact form \u03b8 for (H,J) so that\nthe metric g = \u03c3^-2g takes the form\n\n    g    = ^2 \u03d5\u00b7g_\u03b8  ,\n\nwhere g_\u03b8\u2208n.e.c is the metric associated to \u03b8, and off Z, the Ricci tensor of g satisfies\n\n    (k,k)     = 0   .\n\nIn particular, we can write\n\n    \u03c3    = cos\u03d5\u00b7\u03c3_\u03b8  ,\n\nwhere \u03c3_\u03b8 is the Lorentzian scale of g_\u03b8\n\nLocally, any almost Lorentzian scale \u03c3 on M such that the Ricci tensor of  g = \u03c3^-2g satisfies (<ref>) arises in this way.\n\n\n\n\tIf a density \u03c3 satisfying (<ref>) exists, then off its zero set Z, the metric g = \u03c3^-2g will satisfy (<ref>). This follows from the same argument used in the proof of Proposition <ref>. So we first show that a metric g with the required Ricci prescription exists. To this end, we may work on some open set U and assume that\n\t\n    g    = ^\u03c6g_\u03b8  ,\n \t\n\tfor some smooth function \u03c6 on M, and where g_\u03b8\u2208n.e.c for some contact form \u03b8.  The condition that the Ricci tensor of g satisfies (<ref>) is equivalent to \u03c6 satisfying \u03c6\u0308 - \u03c6\u0307^2 = 1 <cit.>. On U\u2216Z, this has a unique solution, up to sign,\n\t\n    ^\u03c6    = \u03f1\u00b7cos(\u03d5 - \u03d5)   ,\n\n\tfor some smooth functions \u03f1 and \u03d5 on M, where \u03f1 is nowhere vanishing. We can then rescale \u03b8 by \u03f1, and reparametrise the geodesics of k as in (<ref>), and this allows us to define Z by (<ref>).  Then, the zero set of \u03c3 is precisely Z, and off Z, its associated metric is given by (<ref>) with Ricci tensor satisfying the required property (<ref>). Since g_\u03b8 = \u03c3_\u03b8^-2g for some \u03c3_\u03b8\u2208\u0393(E_+[1]) is regular on U, the almost Lorentzian scale corresponding to g can be expressed by (<ref>).\n\n\n\n\n\tCondition (<ref>) is in fact conformal invariant if we restrict ourselves to conformal changes of the metric that are induced from changes of contact forms on (M,H,J) \u2014 this can be seen from the transformation law (<ref>) for the Schouten tensor. This therefore places no condition on the existence of any particular (almost) Lorentzian scales.\n\n\nSince the zero set of the density \u03c3 in Proposition <ref> is never empty, we obtain as a corollary:\n\n\tLet (M,c,k) \u03d6_\u2218\u27f6 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics. Then there is no global metric in c whose Ricci tensor satisfies (k,k) = 0. \n\n\n\n\nWhile g_\u03b8 in Proposition <ref> is regular on U, in general there is still no guarantee that it is periodic, which prevents us to conclude that (M, c, k) is a circle bundle. \n\nLet us now suppose that the optical geometry in Proposition <ref> is in fact a perturbed Fefferman conformal structure, which means that we work on a circle, rather than line, bundle, and as described in Section <ref>, the fibre coordinate \u03d5, the contact form \u03b8 and the perturbed Fefferman metric g_\u03b8,\u03be are all determined by a choice of non-vanishing section \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,0)). We now define \u03c3 := z \u03c3 where z = \u03f1^-\u0131\u03d5 with \u03f1 and \u03d5 being the functions of integrations in (<ref>). This induces a change of contact form, and thus a change of perturbed Fefferman metric g_\u03b8,\u03be, and a change of fibre coordinate. For notational convenience, we drop the hats, i.e. \u03c3 is our new density \u03c3. Then \u03c3 is an almost Lorentzian scale given by \u03c3 = cos\u03d5\u00b7\u03c3_\u03b8, where \u03c3_\u03b8 is the Lorentzian scale for g_\u03b8,\u03be, and it is not difficult to see that it must satisfy \n\n    k^ak^b( \u2207_a\u2207_b\u03c3 + \u03a1_a b\u03c3)     = 0   ,\n\nby virtue of (<ref>). Finally, since the fibre coordinate \u03d5 lies in [-\u03c0, \u03c0), the zero set of \u03c3 is now simply the hypersurfaces \u03d5 = \u00b1\u03c0/2, which, by definition of the Fefferman bundle, can be identified as the cross-sections [\u00b1\u0131\u03c3] : M\u2192M.\n\nWe can now reformulate Proposition <ref> as follows:\n\n\n\tLet (M,c_\u03be,k) \u03d6\u27f6 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional perturbed Fefferman space. Then any choice of non-vanishing density \u03c3 of weight (1,0) on M determines an almost Lorentzian scale \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E[1]) on M that satisfies \n\t\t\n    k^ak^b( \u2207_a\u2207_b\u03c3 + \u03a1_a b\u03c3)     = 0   ,\n\nand whose zero set Z of \u03c3 consists of the union Z_+ \u222aZ_- of the sections Z_\u00b1 = { [\u00b1\u0131\u03c3^-1] : M\u2192M} for some unique, up to sign, density \u03c3 of weight (1,0) on M.\n\nIn particular, the metric g = \u03c3^-2g takes the form\n\n    g    = ^2 \u03d5\u00b7g_\u03b8,\u03be  ,\n\nwhere g_\u03b8,\u03be is the perturbed Fefferman metric associated to the contact form \u03b8 = (\u03c3\u03c3)^-1\u03b8, and \u03d5 is the fibre coordinate determined by \u03c3. Off Z, the Ricci tensor of g satisfies\n\t\t\n    (k,k)     = 0   .\n\n\n\tConversely, any almost Lorentzian scale \u03c3 on M satisfying (<ref>) arises from a non-vanishing density \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,0)), unique up to sign.\n\n\n\n\tThe sign ambiguity of the density \u03c3 in Proposition <ref> is harmless since the change \u03c3\u21a6 -\u03c3 leaves the contact form \u03b8 unchanged, and merely interchanges the two connected components Z_+ and Z_+ of the zero set of \u03c3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Almost weakly half-Einstein scales\n\nWe can proceed with a discussion of the almost Lorentzian scales introduced in Section <ref>. The next proposition is a reformulation of a classical result that has its roots in the work of Robinson, Trautman and Kerr, to name but a few, but was subsequently interpreted in the language of CR geometry in Lewandowski1990a,Hill2008.\n\n\tA four-dimensional optical geometry (M,c,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J) with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics admits an almost weakly half-Einstein scale if and only if (M,H,J) locally admits a CR function.\n\n\n\nIf (M,c,k) admits an almost weakly half-Einstein scale, then off its zero set Z, the Ricci tensor of the metric g = \u03c3^-2g satisfies (<ref>). By Proposition <ref>, there exists \u03bb_\u03b1\u2208\u0393(E_\u03b1) that satisfies (<ref>), which is none other than the Webster\u2013Weyl equation (<ref>). By Theorem <ref>, we can conclude that (M,H,J) admits a CR function. The converse works just analogously.\n\n\nLet us now specialise to the case where we start from a perturbed Fefferman space. This will allow us to determine the nature of the Webster\u2013Weyl equation in this context.\n\n\tA four-dimensional perturbed Fefferman space (M,c_\u03be,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J) admits an almost weakly half-Einstein scale \u03c3 if and only if \u03be is determined by some CR data ( \u03be_\u03b1^(-2),  \u03be_\u03b1^(0), [\u2207,\u03be_0^(k)] )_k \u2208I for some subset I\u2282_\u22650, and there exists a non-vanishing density \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,0)) such that\n\t\t\n    \u03be\u2207_\u03b1\u0305\u03c3 + 2\u0131\u03be_\u03b1\u0305^(2)\u03c3 = 0   , \n       \u03be\u2207_\u03b1\u03be\u2207_\u03b2\u03c3 + \u0131_\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3 = 0   ,\n\n\t\twhere \u03be^(-2)_\u03b1 = \u03c3\u03c3^-1\u03be_\u03b1^(-2) and \u03be\u2207_\u03b1 denotes any partial Webster connection gauged by \u03be_\u03b1^(0). In addition, the zero set Z of \u03c3 consists of the union Z_+ \u222aZ_- of the sections Z_\u00b1 = { [\u00b1\u0131\u03c3^-1] : M\u2192M}.\n\n\n\n\t\tWe have two immediate consequences of the existence of an almost weakly half-Einstein scale \u03c3. First, by Theorem <ref>, \u27e8\u03be\u27e9 is a repeated PND of the Weyl tensor of c_\u03be, and so by Corollary <ref>, the perturbation one-form \u03be is determined by some CR data ( \u03be_\u03b1^(-2),  \u03be_\u03b1^(0), [\u2207,\u03be_0^(k)] )_k \u2208I for some subset I\u2282_\u22650. Second, since \u03c3 satisfies (<ref>) in particular, we have by Proposition <ref> a distinguished non-vanishing density \u03c3 such that [\u00b1\u0131\u03c3^-1] are the zero set Z of \u03c3.\tIn terms of the fibre coordinate \u03d5 defined by \u03c3, the metric g = \u03c3^-2g takes the form (<ref>). We already know that its Ricci tensor satisfies (<ref>). The remaining consequences of the condition (<ref>), i.e. (v , v ) = 0 for any v\u2208\u0393(N) are given in Proposition <ref> as (<ref>) and (<ref>), which, using the identification (<ref>), imply\n\t\n    \u03be\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3 +  2 \u0131\u03be_\u03b1 ^(-2)\u03c3    = 0   ,     \u03be\u2207_\u03b1\u03be\u2207_\u03b2\u03c3 + \u0131_\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3 = 0   ,\n\n\trespectively. The second of these equations is just (<ref>), and since we are using the Webster connection compatible with \u03c3\u03c3, the complex conjugate of the first is just (<ref>).\n\t\n\tFor the converse, we assume that we have the CR data as given and a density \u03c3 of weight (1,0) that satisfies (<ref>) and (<ref>). By Proposition <ref>, \u03c3 gives rise to an almost Lorentzian scale \u03c3 satisfying (<ref>) with zero set Z determined by [\u00b1\u0131\u03c3^-1]. By appealing to Proposition <ref>, it is then a simple matter to check that off Z, the Ricci tensor of the metric g = \u03c3^2g satisfies (<ref>): Choose \u2207 to be compatible with \u03b8 = (\u03c3\u03c3)^-1\u03b8, and trivialise (<ref>) and (<ref>) to obtain (<ref>) and (<ref>) as required.\n\n\nIn two special cases, we obtain the following consequences:\n\n\tLet (M,c_\u03be,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional perturbed Fefferman space.\n\t\n\t\t\n  * Suppose that \u03be is determined by some CR data (\u03be_\u03b1^(0), [\u2207,\u03be_0^(k)] )_k \u2208I for some subset I\u2282_\u22650. Then (M,c_\u03be,k) admits an almost weakly half-Einstein scale \u03c3 if and only if (M,H,J) is realisable.\n\t\t\n  * Suppose that \u03be is determined by some CR data (\u03be_0^(k))_k \u2208I for some subset I\u2282_\u22650. Then (M,c_\u03be,k) admits an almost weakly half-Einstein scale \u03c3 if and only if (M,H,J) is CR\u2013Einstein.\n\t \n\n\n\n\tFor the first part, (<ref>) and (<ref>), with \u03be_\u03b1^(-2) = 0, are simply (<ref>) and (<ref>) respectively with \u03c4 = \u03c3. By Theorem <ref> the result follows. For the second part, if in addition \u03be_\u03b1^(0) = 0, (<ref>) and (<ref>) are the defining equations for a CR\u2013Einstein structure \u2014 see Remark <ref>\n\n\n\nThe second part of Corollary <ref> also tells us that the underlying CR structure is flat. Weaker conditions are certainly possible if one assumes that \u03be_\u03b1\u0305^(0) or \u03be_\u03b1\u0305^(2) are `exact'. We leave the details to the reader.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Almost weakly half-Einstein scales and null vacuum Maxwell two-forms\n\nDrawing from the terminology used in physics, a vacuum Maxwell two-form on a four-dimensional Lorentzian conformal manifold (M,c) is a two-form F that is both closed and co-closed, i.e.\n    F    = 0   ,    \u22c6F    = 0   .\n\nHere, \u22c6 is the (conformally invariant) Hodge dual operator on two-forms on M. Such a two-form will be said to be null or algebraically special if there exists a null vector field k such that\n\n    kF    = 0   ,    \u03ba\u2227F    = 0   .\n\nwhere \u03ba = g (k , \u00b7 ). In this case, we shall refer to the span of k as a repeated principal null direction (PND) of F. Both (<ref>) and (<ref>) are conformally invariant.\n\nCondition (<ref>) tells us that we can write F = F^+ + F^- where F^\u00b1 are simple complex two-forms satisfying F^\u00b1 = F^\u2213 and \u22c6F^\u00b1 = \u00b1\u0131F^\u00b1. More precisely, k defines an optical structure K := \u27e8k\u27e9 on (M,c) with almost Robinson structure (N,K), and F^+ \u2208\u0393(\u22c0^2 (N)). By (<ref>), F^\u00b1 are closed, so N is involutive, which is equivalent to k being tangent to a non-shearing congruence of null geodesics K. This is essentially the content of Mariot's Theorem <cit.>: a null vacuum Maxwell two-form locally always gives rise to a non-shearing congruence of null geodesics. In particular, the leaf space of K is a CR three-manifold (M,H,J), contact if the congruence is twisting, and by (<ref>) and (<ref>), using a suitable orientation on M, F^+ is the pull-back of a closed section of the canonical bundle of (M,H,J).\n\nThis already suggests that a converse of Mariot's Theorem will not in general be possible: starting from a twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics, a null vacuum Maxwell two-form would have to arise from a closed section of the canonical bundle of a contact CR three-manifold. But the existence is in general not guaranteed unless (M,H,J) is realisable. In particular, if one works in the analytic category, the CR three-manifold is certainly realisable and admits closed sections, and one can construct analytic null vacuum Maxwell two-forms. This is known as Robinson's Theorem <cit.>. Tafel <cit.> showed that Robinson's result may fail otherwise, and indeed, highlighted its failure in terms of a Lewy operator on the CR three-manifold.\n\nThe following result is a reformulation of <cit.> and <cit.>.\n\n\tLet (M,c,k) \u2192 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics. Then locally c admits an almost weakly half-Einstein scale and \u27e8k\u27e9 is a repeated PND of a null vacuum Maxwell two-form if and only if (M,H,J) is realisable.\n\n\n\n\tSuppose that (M,c, k) admits an almost weakly half-Einstein scale. Then Proposition <ref> provides a CR function and the null Maxwell two-form the closed section of the canonical bundle. By Theorem <ref>, realisability follows. The converse follows from Proposition <ref> alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Almost half-Einstein scales\n\nOur next result is an alternative characterisation of four-dimensional optical geometries with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics arising from perturbed Fefferman spaces.\n\n\tLet (M,c,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics that admits an almost half-Einstein scale \u03c3. Then (M,c,k) is locally conformally isometric to a perturbed Fefferman space (M',c'_\u03be,k') \u27f6 (M,H,J) where the pertubation one-form \u03be is determined by some CR data(\u03be_\u03b1^(0), \u03be_\u03b1^(-2), [\u2207 , \u03be_0^(0), \u03be_0^(2)], \u03be_0^(4)).\n\n\n\t\nSince (M,c,k) admits an almost half-Einstein scale, \u27e8k\u27e9 is a repeated PND of the Weyl tensor by Theorem <ref>. By Lemma <ref>, the dependence of the component \u03bb_\u03b1 on the fibre coordinate \u03d5 is fully determined as (<ref>). Next, off the zero set of \u03c3, the Ricci tensor of g = \u03c3^-2g satisfies (<ref>) and has constant Ricci scalar.

Further the existence of a density \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,0)) that satisfies (<ref>) and (<ref>) is guaranteed by Theorem <ref>.

Choosing the Webster connection for which \u03bd_\u03b1 = 0, we can similarly trivialise equations (<ref>) and (<ref>). Again, using (<ref>), and computing the Ricci tensor, we find that the components of \u03bb satisfy the conditions given in Proposition <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Almost pure radiation scales\n\nWhile the Bach tensor of a conformal four-manifold is an obstruction to the existence of an almost Einstein scale, its vanishing is not necessary for the existence of an almost pure radiation scale. For our purposes, we shall need the following weaker condition.\n\n\n\tLet (M,c,k) be a four-dimensional optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics that admits an almost pure radiation scale. Then \u27e8k\u27e9 is a repeated PND of the Weyl tensor, and the Bach tensor satisfies (k,k) = 0.\n\n\n\nLet \u03c3 be an almost pure radiation scale. Then \u27e8k\u27e9 is a repeated PND of the Weyl tensor by Theorem <ref>. Let g = \u03c3^-2g be the pure radiation metric off the zero set of \u03c3. By (<ref>), the Schouten tensor of g can be written as\n\n    \u03a1_a b    = 1/2\u03a6\u03ba_a\u03ba_b + 1/2\u039bg_a b  ,\n\nfor some smooth function \u03a6 on M, constant \u039b and where \u03ba = g(k,\u00b7). By (<ref>), we must compute the expression\n\n    k^a k^b _a b    = - k^a k^b \u2207^c_a b c + k^a k^b \u03a1^c d_a c b d  ,\n\nThe second term of the RHS of this expression is then clearly zero, and we are left with the first term, which by the product rule, can be re-arranged as\n\n    k^a k^b \u2207^c_a b c    = \u2207^c( k^a k^b _a b c) - ( \u2207^ck^a ) k^b _a b c - ( \u2207^ck^b ) k^a _a b c  .\n\nNow, using equation (<ref>) for the definition of the Cotton tensor, the product rule and the fact that \u03a1_a bk^b = 0, we  k^a k^b _a b c = 0, thus, the first term of the RHS of (<ref>) is zero. Next, using (<ref>) and substituting in (<ref>), we find ( \u2207^ck^a ) k^b _a b c = 0, so that the second term of the RHS of (<ref>) vanishes, and so does the third term by the symmetries of _a b c. Hence, B(k,k) = 0 off the zero set of \u03c3. These conformally invariant conditions extend smoothly to the zero set of \u03c3.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Lemma <ref> and Theorem <ref>, we immediately obtained the following corollary.\n\nLet (M,c,k)\u27f6 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional optical geometry with twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics that admits an almost pure radiation scale.

Choose any density  \u03c3 of weight (1,0) and let \u03c3 be any almost Lorentzian scale whose zero set Z consists of the union Z_+ \u222aZ_- of the sections Z_\u00b1 = { [\u00b1\u0131\u03c3^-1] : M\u2192M}.

The expressions (<ref>) evaluated at \u03d5 = \u00b1\u03c0/2 simply correspond to (<ref>), (<ref>) and (<ref>). The computation of  (<ref>) is similar.\n\n\nComparing (<ref>) from Proposition <ref> and (<ref>) from Proposition <ref>, we obtain:\n\n\tLet (M,c_\u03be, k ) \u27f6 (M,H,J) be a perturbed Fefferman space as in Proposition <ref>, and suppose it admits an almost half-Einstein scale \u03c3 with zero set Z. Then the Weyl tensor is of Petrov type III or more degenerate on Z.\n\n\n\nLet us now delve further into the causal properties of Z. We start in greater generality by assuming the existence of an almost Lorentzian scale \u03c3 on a perturbed manifold (M,c_\u03be). Then, for each choice of Levi-Civita connection \u2207, we have a weighted one-form\n\n    \u03bd_a    := \u2207_a\u03c3\u2208\u0393( E_a[1])   .\n\nThis depends on the choice of metric in c_\u03be since under a conformal change, \u03bd_a transforms as \u03bd_a = \u03bd_a + \u03a5_a\u03c3. However, on restriction to Z, any of these weighted forms coincides with the weighted normal covector of Z <cit.>.\n\nLet us assume further that \u03c3 is an almost half-Einstein scale. By Theorem <ref>, \u03c3 is determined by some non-vanishing \u03c3\u2208\u0393(E(1,0)) trivialising M\u2192M with fibre coordinate \u03d5 and with contact form \u03b8 = (\u03c3\u03c3)^-1\u03b8, associated Fefferman scale \u03c3_\u03b8,\u03be so that \u03c3 = cos\u03d5\u00b7\u03c3_\u03b8,\u03be. Its zero set is given by Z = Z_+  \u222aZ_- where Z_\u00b1 = { [\u00b1\u0131\u03c3^-1] : M\u2192M}. This means two things: First, for each choice of Levi-Civita connection \u2207, the weighted one-form (<ref>) reads as\n\n    \u03bd    = - \u03c3_\u03b8,\u03be\u00b7sin\u03d5\u00b7\u03d5\u0323+ cos\u03d5\u00b7\u2207\u03c3_\u03b8,\u03be  .\n\nSecond, we may choose our Levi-Civita connection to preserve the distinguished perturbed Fefferman scale \u03c3_\u03b8,\u03be to single out the one-form of weight 1 and vector field of weight -1\n\n    (\u03b8)\u03bd    = - \u03c3_\u03b8,\u03be\u00b7sin\u03d5\u00b7\u03d5\u0323  ,    (\u03b8)n    = g^-1 ( (\u03b8)\u03bd , \u00b7 )   .\n\nComputing the length squared of (\u03b8)n on restriction to Z, we find \n\n    g ((\u03b8)n, \t(\u03b8)n) |_Z    = -1/3\u039b  .\n\nWe can then immediately reformulate a standard result of mathematical relativity Penrose1965,Penrose1986 in terms of almost half-Einstein scales:\n\n\tLet (M,c_\u03be,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J) be a four-dimensional perturbed Fefferman space that admits an almost half-Einstein scale \u03c3, so that off the zero set Z of \u03c3, the metric g = \u03c3^-2g is half-Einstein with constant Ricci scalar 4 \u039b. Then\n\t\n\t\t\n  * Z is null if and only if \u039b = 0;\n\t\t\n  * Z is spacelike if and only if \u039b > 0;\n\t\t\n  * Z is timelike if and only if \u039b < 0.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t In general, while Z is expected to have merely a conformal, rather than metric, structure \u2014 see for instance <cit.> \u2014 in our case, by virtue of the almost half-Einstein equations, we do in fact have a distinguished regular metric on Z, namely, the perturbed Fefferman metric (<ref>) pulled back to Z:\n\t\n    g_\u03b8,\u03be |_Z    = 4 \u03b8\u2299( \u0131/2( \u03c3^-1\u2207\u03c3 - \u03c3^-1\u2207\u03c3)  - 1/3\u03a1\u03b8 + \u03be|_Z) + h   .\n\nThis clearly depends on the pseudo-hermitian data.\n\tProposition <ref> can also derived by computing the determinant ( .g_\u03b8,\u03be|_Z) = -4/3\u039b. When (\u03b8))n is null, it is tangent to Z and the metric g_\u03b8,\u03be is degenerate. \n\n\n\nWith this result at hand, we are now in the position of proving the following:\n\n\tSuppose (M,c_\u03be,k) admits an almost pure radiation scale \u03c3 with zero set Z. Then c_\u03be is conformally flat on Z.\n\n\n\n\tLet us take another covariant of the defining equation (<ref>) for \u03c3 with (<ref>) and (<ref>). Then commuting the covariant derivatives, we derive the integrability condition\n\t\n    _a b c d\u03bd^d + _c a b\u03c3    = T_a b c\u03c3 - \u03a6\u03ba_c\u03ba_[a\u03bd_b]  ,\n\nfor some tracefree tensor T_a b c regular on M, and where \u03bd_a = \u2207_a\u03c3. We already know by Lemma <ref> that \u03a6 = 0 on Z. Hence\n\n    _a b c d\u03bd^d     = 0   ,\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\n\t\n  * If \u039b\u2260 0, then by Proposition <ref>, Z is spacelike or timelike, and so \u03bd_a is non-null. It is easy to verify that in dimension four, at any point, given such a non-null vector, the Weyl tensor generically takes the form _a b c d = (\u03bd_[a_b] c d + \u03bd_[c_d] a b)_\u2218 for some tracefree _a b c=_a [b c] satisfying _[a b c] = 0. Condition (<ref>) now implies that =0 on Z.\n\t\n  * If \u039b = 0, then by Proposition <ref>, Z is null, and so is \u03bd_a. Hence (<ref>) implies that \u03bd_a is a quadruple PND of  on Z. This would mean that k degenerates to a quadruple PND of  and so would be proportional to \u03bd^a on Z. But this is impossible since \u03bd^a is tangent to the null hypersurface Z and k^a is transverse to it. Hence, =0 on Z.\n\nThis ends the proof.\n\n\n\nCombining Proposition <ref> and Proposition <ref>, and on inspection of Table <ref>, we have\n\t\n\t\tLet (M,c_\u03be, k ) \u27f6 (M,H,J) be a perturbed Fefferman space as in Proposition <ref>, and suppose it admits an almost pure radiation scale \u03c3 with zero set Z.

We can then think of M' as the bulk of some manifold M with boundary Z, at least locally.\n\t\t\n\tNote however that these results are very much local, and assumptions on (M',g,k) such as being asymptotically simple <cit.> may be too strong. Indeed, it is demonstrated in <cit.> that this condition is too stringent in our context: the only algebraically special asymptotically simple Ricci-flat Lorentzian four-manifold is Minkowski space.\n\t\n\tNevertheless, one may assume that the geodesics of the congruence generated by k reach only some portions of conformal infinity.  One could then use the above results to describes the asymptotic properties of such spacetimes, but only along the congruence. Thus, from Proposition <ref>, we may say that the M' is asymptotically conformally flat along the geodesics of k, and by Proposition <ref>, more specifically asymptotically flat, de Sitter or anti Sitter along the geodesics of k depending on the sign of the Ricci scalar. For instance, the Taub\u2013NUT metric <cit.> is well-known to be globally non-asymptotically flat since the topology of its conformal infinity is S^3, but it is asymptotically flat along the geodesics of its twisting non-shearing congruences of null geodesics.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 COMMENTS ON CONFORMAL SYMMETRIES\n\nGiven a four-dimensional perturbed Fefferman space (M,c_\u03be,k) \u27f6 (M,H,J), one may naturally ask how conformal symmetries of (M,c_\u03be,k) relate to solutions to CR invariant differential equations on its base (M,H,J). While this question goes beyond the scope of this article, we shall nevertheless outline some ideas towards the answer.\n\nLet us first review the situation in the unperturbed case, i.e. \u03be = 0. It is shown in <cit.> that the space of all conformal Killing fields on a Fefferman space (M,c,k) splits into a direct sum of three spaces\n\n    A_8 \u2295A_6 \u2295\u27e8k\u27e9  ,\n\nwhere\n\n\t\n  * any section of A_8 is transverse to \u27e8k\u27e9^\u22a5 and arises from a real solution s \u2208\u0393(E(1,1)) of\n\t\n    \u2207_\u03b1\u2207_\u03b2 s + \u0131_\u03b1\u03b2 s     = 0   ,\n\n\tand such a solution gives rise to transverse infinitesimal CR symmetries as we have already seen in Section <ref>;\n\t\n  * any section of A_6 is tangent to \u27e8k\u27e9^\u22a5 and arises from a solution w^\u03b1\u2208\u0393(E^\u03b1(-1,1)) to\n\t\n    \u2207^(\u03b1 w^\u03b2)    = 0   ,    \u2207_\u03b1 w^\u03b2    = \u03b4_\u03b1^\u03b2\u2207_\u03b3 w^\u03b3  .\n\n\tIn dimension three, however, the second condition is vacuous, while the first one reduces to \u2207^\u03b1 w^\u03b2 = 0.\n\nFor conformally flat (M,c,k), the dimensions of A_8 and A_6 are eight and six respectively, the former being the maximal dimension of the automorphism group of (M,H,J) as expected. Together with \u27e8k\u27e9, these indeed add up to 15, the maximal dimension of the automorphism group of (M,c,k).\n\nThere are two ways in which a perturbation of (M,c,k) by a semi-basic one-form \u03be affects the decomposition (<ref>): first, k itself will cease to be conformal Killing (unless k\u03be = 0). Second, the perturbation one-form will affect the conformal curvature, and in particular, the dimension of each summand in (<ref>) will not be preserved.\n\nSuppose that we start with a conformally flat (M,c,k). Then we end up with non-conformally flat perturbed Fefferman spaces over a flat CR manifold. To illustrate this phenomenon, and following <cit.> a flat CR three-manifold (i.e. either the Heisenberg group or three-sphere) gives rise to four distinct perturbed Fefferman spaces, each admitting an almost Einstein scale \u03c3 with zero set Z:\n\n\t\n  * the canonical conformally flat Fefferman conformal structure that contains the Minkowski metric off Z;\n\t\n  * a perturbed Fefferman conformal structure that contains the Petrov type D Taub-NUT metric Taub1951,Newman1963 off Z;\n\t\n  * a perturbed Fefferman conformal structure that contains the Petrov type N Hauser metric <cit.> off Z.\n\n\nIncidentally, since in dimension four, the `unperturbed' Fefferman conformal structure admits an almost Einstein scale if and only if it is conformally flat (or equivalently its underlying CR structure is flat), the main point of these perturbations is to enlarge the range of possible almost Einstein scales.\n\nIn fact, a conformally flat space (M,c) can be viewed as a (perturbed) Fefferman space in an `infinitely' many ways: The space of all null geodesics in M is a contact CR five-fold PN of signature (1,1), and any contact CR submanifold of PN of dimension three gives rise to a twisting non-shearing congruences of null geodesics on M. In the analytic category, the so-called Kerr theorem tells us that such CR three-manifolds can be constructed as the intersection of PN\u2282^3 with a complex surface in ^3, the twistor space of (M,c) <cit.>. For instance, the `massless' Kerr metric is flat, but its underlying CR three-manifold admits a two-dimensional group of symmetry.\n\n\n\nIn  <cit.>, the authors consider algebraically special pure radiation metrics, which can therefore be treated as almost pure radiation scales on a perturbed Fefferman space, with underlying contact CR three-manifold admitting an automorphism group of submaximal dimension (in this case, three).\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ADAPTED CR COFRAMES OF THE SECOND KIND\n\nLet (M,H,J) be a contact CR three-manifold. Then any choice of non-vanishing section f_\u03b1 of H^(1,0) determines a unique real non-vanishing vector field f_0 defined by the relation\n\n    [f_\u03b1, f_\u03b2\u0305]     = - \u0131\u03b4_\u03b1\u03b2\u0305f_0   .\n\nThe triple ( f_0, f_\u03b1, f_\u03b1\u0305) will be referred to as a adapted frame of the second kind. Its dual coframe, which we shall denote ( \u03c9, \u03c9^\u03b1, \u03c9^\u03b1\u0305), will be refer to as adapted coframe of the second kind. The commutation relation (<ref>) is then equivalent to the structure equations\n\n    \u03c9\u0323    = \u0131\u03b4_\u03b1\u03b2\u0305\u03c9^\u03b1\u2227\u03c9^\u03b2\u0305 +  \u03c9\u2227( \u0393_\u03b1\u03c9^\u03b1  + \u0393_\u03b1\u0305\u03c9^\u03b1\u0305)   , \n    \u03c9\u0323^\u03b1    = \u039e_\u03b2^\u03b1\u03c9\u2227\u03c9^\u03b2 + \u039e_\u03b2\u0305^\u03b1\u03c9\u2227\u03c9^\u03b2\u0305  , \n    \u03c9^\u03b1\u0305    = \u039e_\u03b2\u0305^\u03b1\u0305\u03c9\u2227\u03c9^\u03b2\u0305 + \u039e_\u03b2^\u03b1\u0305\u03c9\u2227\u03c9^\u03b2  ,\n\nfor some complex-valued functions \u0393_\u03b1, \u039e_\u03b2^\u03b1, \u039e_\u03b2\u0305^\u03b1, where \u0393_\u03b1\u0305 = \u0393_\u03b1, \u039e_\u03b2\u0305^\u03b1\u0305 = \u039e_\u03b2^\u03b1 and \u039e_\u03b2^\u03b1\u0305 = \u039e_\u03b2\u0305^\u03b1. Note that by definition, (f_\u03b1) and (\u03c9^\u03b1)  are necessarily unitary with respect to the Levi form of \u03c9. As before, we raise and lower the indices freely using \u03b4_\u03b1\u03b2\u0305 and its inverse, i.e. v^\u03b1 = \u03b4^\u03b1\u03b2\u0305 v_\u03b2\u0305, and so on.\n\n\nNow define\n\n    \u03b8    = \u03c9  ,    \u03b8^\u03b1    = \u03c9^\u03b1 - \u0131\u0393^\u03b1\u03b8  ,    \u03b8^\u03b1\u0305    = \u03c9^\u03b1\u0305 + \u0131\u0393^\u03b1\u0305\u03b8  ,\n\nor equivalently,\n\n    \u2113    = f_0 + \u0131\u0393^\u03b1f_\u03b1 - \u0131\u0393^\u03b1\u0305f_\u03b1\u0305  ,    e_\u03b1    = f_\u03b1  ,    e_\u03b1\u0305    = f_\u03b1\u0305  .\n\nThen (\u03b8, \u03b8^\u03b1, \u03b8^\u03b1\u0305) is a unitary coframe of the first kind with dual (\u2113, e_\u03b1, e_\u03b1\u0305), and by inspection of the structure equations (<ref>) with h_\u03b1\u03b2\u0305 = \u03b4_\u03b1\u03b2\u0305, we obtain the relation\n\n    \u0393_\u03b1    = \u0393_\u03b1\u03b2\u0305^\u03b2\u0305  ,    \u0393_\u03b1\u0305    = \u0393_\u03b1\u0305\u03b2^\u03b2  , \n    \u039e_\u03b2^\u03b1    = -   \u0393_0 \u03b3^\u03b3\u03b4_\u03b2^\u03b1 -  \u0131 e_\u03b2 (\u0393^\u03b1_\u03b3^\u03b3)    ,    \u039e_\u03b2\u0305^\u03b1\u0305    = - \u0393_0 \u03b3\u0305^\u03b3\u0305\u03b4_\u03b2\u0305^\u03b1\u0305 +  \u0131 e_\u03b2\u0305 (\u0393^\u03b1\u0305_\u03b3\u0305^\u03b3\u0305)    , \n    \u039e_\u03b2\u0305^\u03b1    =  ^\u03b1_\u03b2\u0305 -  \u0131 e_\u03b2\u0305(\u0393^\u03b1_\u03b3^\u03b3)    ,    \u039e_\u03b2^\u03b1\u0305    = ^\u03b1\u0305_\u03b2 +  \u0131 e_\u03b2 (\u0393^\u03b1\u0305_\u03b3^\u03b3)     .\n\n\nThe above transformation from a coframe of the second kind to a unitary coframe of the first kind is clearly invertible. In addition, any such coframe determines the non-vanishing section of the canonical bundle given by \u03b8^0 \u2227\u03b8^1 = \u03c9\u2227\u03c9^1. Conversely, any non-vanishing local section \u03b6 of the canonical bundle determines a unique contact form \u03b8 by the volume normalisation condition (<ref>). The remaining freedom (\u03b8^\u03b1) is to choose the admissible coframe such that \u03b6 = \u03b8^0 \u2227\u03b8^1.\n\n In summary:\n\n\tLocally, there is a one-to-one correspondence between\n\t\n\t\t\n  * unitary adapted coframes of the first kind,\n\t\t\n  * adapted coframes of the second kind,\n\t\t\n  * non-vanishing sections of the canonical bundle.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PROPERTIES OF THE BACH TENSOR\n\n\tLet (M,c,k) be an optical geometry of dimension four equipped with a twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics. We refer the reader to Section <ref> for the general setup induced from such a geometry, that is, we work with a metric g in n.ec. This means that \u03ba = g(k,\u00b7) is the pull-back of a contact form on the leaf space (M, H, J) and\n\t\n    \u2207_a\u03ba_b     = \u03c4_a b + 2 E_(a\u03ba_b)  ,\n\n\tfor some two-form \u03c4_a b and one-form E_a such that k^a\u03c4_a b= k^aE_a = 0. In particular,\n\t\n    k^b\u2207_b\u03ba_a    = 0   , \n    \u2207^a\u03ba_a    = 0   ,\n\n\tas expected since the geodesics of k are affinely parametrised and the congruence is non-expanding.\n\t\n\tWe assume from the outset that the Weyl tensor satisfies\n\n    (k,v,k,\u00b7)     = 0   ,\n\nwhich is equivalently to\n\n    (k,v,u,w)     = 0   ,\n\nThis can be re-expressed as k^d_d a b c = \u03ba_a\u03d5_[b c] - \u03ba_[b\u03d5_c] a for some \u03d5_a b satisfying k^a\u03d5_a [b\u03ba_c] = 0, and this tells us that\n\n    k^d_d a b ck^e_e^a b c    = 0   .\n\nIn addition, since \u2207_[a\u03c4_b c] = 0, equation (<ref>) gives\n\n    \u2207_a\u03c4_b c    = _b c^d_a\u03ba_d + 2 \u03c4_b cE_a + 2 \u2207_[bE_c]\u03ba_a  .\n\n\nWe are now in the position to compute, using the definition of the Bach tensor (<ref>),\n\t\n    k^a k^b\t_a b    = - k^a k^b \u2207^c_a b c + k^a k^b \u03a1^c d_a c b d  ,\n\nunder our given assumptions. We break down the computation of the first term of (<ref>) into a number of steps. We first note that\n\n    k^a k^b \u2207^c_a b c    = \t\u2207^c( k^a k^b _a b c) - ( \u2207^ck^a ) k^b _a b c - ( \u2207^ck^b ) k^a _a b c  ,\n\nUsing (<ref>), the product rule, multiple instances of (<ref>) and the fact that \u27e8k\u27e9 is a repeated PND of the Weyl tensor, we find\n\n    k^a k^b _a b c    = \u2207^d (k^a k^b _d a b c) - 3/2\u03c4^d bk^a _d b a c  .\n\nBy (<ref>), we get k^a k^b _a b [c\u03ba_d] = 0.\nThis fact, together with (<ref>) and (<ref>), tells us that\n\n    ( \u2207^ck^b ) k^a _a b c    = - \u03c4^b ck^a _a b c  ,\n\nand using the fact that _[a b c] = 0,\n\n    ( \u2207^ck^a ) k^b _a b c    = - 1/2\u03c4^b ck^a _a b c  .\n\nHence, equation (<ref>) simplifies to\n\n    k^a k^b \u2207^c_a b c    = \t\u2207^c( k^a k^b _a b c) + 3/2\u03c4^b ck^a _a b c  .\n\nFor the last term, we obtain\n\n    \u03c4^b ck^a _a b c    = \u2207^d (\u03c4^b ck^a _d a b c) + 2  \u03a1^b dk^ck^a _d a b c - \u03c4^d a\u03c4^b c_d a b c  ,\n\nwhere we have used (<ref>), the product rule, equations (<ref>), (<ref>), (<ref>),  and (<ref>).

In particular, \u03a6_a b=0 on the zero set of \u03c3.\n\n\n\n\tWe trivialise (<ref>) where the pure radiation field is given by (<ref>) with the Lorentzian scale \u03c3_\u03b8, and since \u03a5 = tan\u03d5 \u03d5\u0323, we find that\n\t\n    \u03a6\u0307 + 2 sin\u03d5\u00b7cos\u03d5\u00b7\u03a6    = 0   ,\n\n\twhich clearly has solution \u03a6 = cos^2 \u03d5\u00b7\u03a6, for some real function \u03a6 on (M,H,J). By CR invariance, we must deduce that \u03a6 arises from a density \u03a6 of weight (-2,-2).\n\n\n\n\tWe have omitted the rather involved expression for the CR density \u03a6 of weight (-2,-2) which determines the pure radiation field of the metric.

But since Lemma <ref> tells us that _0 0 = cos^2 \u03d5\u00b7\u03a6 for some real density of weight (-2,-2), we must conclude that _0 0^(2) = _0 0^(-2) too.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RELATION TO THE DEBNEY\u2013KERR\u2013SCHILD METRIC\n\nIn this section, we provide the appropriate coframe and coordinate transformations to relate a perturbed Fefferman space (M,c_\u03be,k) \u2192 (M,H,J) that admits an almost half-Einstein scale, to the `standard' metric of Debney1969,Stephani2003. Note that the relation between the latter and the form of the metric obtained in <cit.> is already given in <cit.>. In that reference, it is rightly pointed out that the equations on the CR base space are simplest when given in the Debney\u2013Kerr\u2013Schild coordinates. But these lack obvious invariance. There is therefore a trade-off when expression the Einstein equations in an invariant manner.\n\nThe reader should refer to Theorem <ref> for the notation used in the next paragraphs. Since \u0131\u03c3^-1\u03be\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3 is a solution to (<ref>), there exists, by Theorem <ref>, a density \u03c3 of weight (1,0) such that\n\n    \u0131\u03c3^-1\u03be\u2207_\u03b1\u03c3    =  \u0131( \u03c3^-1\u03c3^2) \u2207_\u03b1( \u03c3\u03c3^-2)   ,\n\nUsing the definition of \u03be\u2207_\u03b1 and (<ref>), this allows us to express \u03be_\u03b1^(0) and \u03be_\u03b1^(-2) as\n\n    \u03be_\u03b1^(0)    = \u0131( \u03c3^-1\u03c3^2\u03c3) \u2207_\u03b1( \u03c3\u03c3^-2\u03c3^-1)   , \n    \u03be_\u03b1^(-2)    = \u0131/2( \u03c3^-1\u03c3^2\u03c3\u03c3) \u2207_\u03b1( \u03c3\u03c3^-2\u03c3^-1\u03c3^-1)   .\n\nNote that \u03c3\u03c3^-2\u03c3^-1\u2208E(0,-2) and \u03c3\u03c3^-2\u03c3^-1\u03c3^-1\u2208E(0,-3). Substituting these into (<ref>), we can derive similar expressions for \u03be_0^(0), \u03be_0^(2) and \u03be_0^(4).\n\nLet us write\n\n    \u03c3    = w \u03c3  ,            w     = \u03f1^\u0131\u03d5  ,\n\nfor some smooth real functions \u03f1 > 0 and \u03d5\u2208 [-\u03c0,\u03c0). This induces a change of contact forms \u03b8 = \u03f1^-2\u03b8, and with reference to Appendix <ref>, there are unitary adapted coframes (\u03b8,\u03b8^1,\u03b8^1\u0305) and (\u03c9,\u03c9^1,\u03c9^1\u0305) of the first and second kinds respectively, related by\n\n    \u03b8    = \u03c9  ,    \u03b8^1    = \u03c9^1 - \u0131\u0393^1\u03c9  ,\n\nwhere \u0393_1\u0305 is the connection one-form of the (partial) Webster connection preserving \u03b8. In addition, as guaranteed by Theorem <ref>,\n\n    \u03c9^1     = \u03b6\u0323  ,\n\nfor some CR function \u03b6.  We can re-express\n\n    \u03be_\u03b1^(0) = 2 \u0131\u0393_\u03b1 + \u0131 w^-1\u2207_\u03b1 w   ,\n\nand similar formulae can be derived for the remaining CR data.\n\nWe now trivialise the Fefferman bundle with \u03c3. This induces a change of perturbed Fefferman metrics g_\u03b8,\u03be = \u03f1^-2g_\u03b8,\u03be, a change of fibre coordinates \u03d5 = \u03d5 + \u03d5, and a change of \u03bb=\u03c9_\u03b8 + \u03be as\n\n    \u03bb    = \u03bb - 1/2\u0131\u03a5_1\u03b8^1 + 1/2\u0131\u03a5_1\u0305\u03b8^1\u0305 - 1/2\u03a5_1\u03a5^1\u03b8  ,\n\nwhere \u0393_1 = \u2207_1log\u03f1.

We may also check that the asymptotic properties of the `unphysical' metric g_\u03b8, \u03be as r tends to \u00b1\u221e are consistent with the findings of Section <ref>.\n\n\nTo make contact with the Debney\u2013Kerr\u2013Schild form of the metric Debney1969,Stephani2003, we rescale the one-forms \u03bb and \u03be as \n\n    \u03bb'_\u03c9    = \u03f1\u00b7^2 ( \u03d5 - \u03d5) \u00b7\u03bb_\u03c9  ,    \u03be'     = \u03f1^2 ( \u03d5 - \u03d5) \u03be  .\n\nso that\n\n    \u03bb'_\u03c9    = \u1e5b - r \u1e37\u1ecdg\u0323\u03f1  + r^2 + \u03f1^2/\u03f1( \u03c9_\u03b8 - 1/3\u03a1\u03b8) + \u03be'    ,\n\nThen the metric g takes the form\n\n    g    = 4 \u03f1\u00b7\u03c9\u2299\u03bb'_\u03c9 + 2 (r^2 + \u03f1^2)  \u03c9^1\u2299\u03c9 ^1\u0305  .\n\nWe may also choose a transverse coordinate u and complex-valued function Z on M so that\n\n    \u03c9 = 1/2 \u03f1(\u1ee5 + Z \u03b6\u0323+ Z\u03b6)   .\n\nDropping the hats, we can now recognise metric (<ref>) given in Section <ref>.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t"}
