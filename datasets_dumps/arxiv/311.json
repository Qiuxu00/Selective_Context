Nevertheless, the requirement of multiple coupling for each qudit of quantum systems and the lack of appropriate precision evaluation constraint its applicability extension, especially for multi-qudit quantum systems. Here, we propose a resource-efficient scheme (RES) to directly characterize the density matrix of general multi-qudit systems, which not only optimizes the measurements but also establishes a feasible estimation analysis. In this scheme, an efficient observable of quantum system is constructed such that a single meter state coupled to each qudit is sufficient to extract the corresponding density-matrix element. An appropriate model based on the statistical distribution of errors are used to evaluate the precision and feasibility of the scheme. We experimentally apply the RES to the direct characterization of general single-photon qutrit states and two-photon entangled states. The results show that the RES outperforms the sequential schemes in terms of efficiency and precision in both weak- and strong- coupling scenarios. This work sheds new light on the practical characterization of large-scale quantum systems and investigation of their non-classical properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource-efficient Direct Characterization of General Density Matrix\n    Lijian Zhang\n    March 30, 2023\n====================================================================\n\n\n\nIntroduction.\u2013The density matrix fully describes a quantum system (QS), including its intrinsic properties and how it interacts with other systems. The characterization of the density matrix, especially the off-diagonal elements, is crucial for revealing the non-classical properties of quantum systems <cit.> and underpinning advanced quantum technologies <cit.>. Quantum state tomography (QST) is a standard approach to globally reconstruct the whole density matrix based on the informationally-complete measurement results. However, both the experimental difficulties in implementing informationally-complete quantum measurements and the computational complexity of reconstruction algorithm dramatically increase with growing dimension of quantum systems, making the QST impractical for the characterization of large-scale quantum states. Though many attempts have been made to improve the feasibility of QST <cit.>, the characterization of the entire density matrix would be inefficient when a few specific density-matrix elements are sufficient to reveal certain properties e.g., entanglement <cit.> and coherence <cit.>. \n\nRecently, weak measurement followed by post-selection makes it possible to directly measure the quantum wavefunction of pure states <cit.> as well as the quasi-probability distribution of general mixed states <cit.>, which is equivalent to the density matrix through linear transformation <cit.>. In particular, the density-matrix elements can be directly characterized by sequential measurements of complementary observables <cit.>. Given the significant advantages in the reduced number of measurement basis and the avoidance of the reconstruction algorithm, the direct characterization scheme has also been generalized to quantum processes <cit.> and quantum detectors <cit.>. However, the current direct characterization of density matrix relies on sequential coupling processes for each qudit of quantum systems, which largely restricts its efficiency and scalability to multi-particle and high-dimensional quantum states <cit.>. Thus, the up-to-date direct characterization of high-dimensional or two-photon density matrix has to resort to introducing certain assumptions or utilizing extra quantum resources <cit.>. Beyond that, the extraction of high-order correlation information during the sequential weak measurements leads to large statistical errors <cit.>. A rigorous framework based on strong measurements has also been developed to improve the characterization precision <cit.>. Yet, such an approach may destroy the unique advantages of weak measurement in slight disturbance to the quantum systems. \n\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose a resource-efficient scheme (RES) to directly characterize the density-matrix elements of general multi-qudit quantum systems. An efficient observable is constructed through Hadamard transformations, which allows to extract the density-matrix element of interest with one coupling process for each qudit. We experimentally demonstrate the RES by directly characterizing the density matrix of single-photon qutrit states and two-photon entangled states during the unitary evolution and dephasing processes. Our results show that the RES achieves better precision than sequential schemes with fewer quantum measurements in two prevalent situations, where the coupling strength is weak or simultaneously optimized in terms of precision. \n\n\n\nTheoretical framework.\u2013We first consider a general single-qudit (d-dimensional) QS described by the density matrix \u03c1 = \u2211_a,a^'\u03c1_a,a^'|a\u27e9\u27e8 a^'|. The diagonal element \u03c1_a,a can be easily obtained with the projective measurements \u03c0\u0302_a = |a\u27e9\u27e8 a| yielding \u03c1_a,a = Tr(\u03c1\u03c0\u0302_a). In sequential weak measurement scheme, the off-diagonal element \u03c1_a,a^' (a\u2260 a^') is associated with the average value Tr(M\u0302_a^',a\u03c1) = \u03c1_a,a^' of the operator M\u0302_a^',a = d\u03c0\u0302_a^'\u03c0\u0302_b\u03c0\u0302_a, where \u03c0\u0302_b = |b\u27e9\u27e8 b| and |b\u27e9 =1/\u221a(d)\u2211_a|a\u27e9. Practically, one sequentially couples the observables \u03c0\u0302_a and \u03c0\u0302_b with two independent meter states followed by the projector \u03c0\u0302_a^' for the post-selection <cit.>. The joint measurement on the post-selected meter states leads to the average value of M\u0302_a^',a. Here, we adopt an alternative decomposition of M\u0302_a^',a = \u03c0\u0302_a^'\u0108_a,a^' to the product of the efficient observable \u0108_a,a^' = |a\u27e9\u27e8 a^'| + |a^'\u27e9\u27e8 a| and the projector \u03c0\u0302_a^' for the post-selection. With this decomposition, the density-matrix element can be directly characterized through one coupling operation for each qudit to measure the efficient observable.\n\n\n\nFig. <ref> (A) shows how to directly characterize the density matrix of a single-qudit QS with the RES. In the red dashed box, we implement the coupling between the QS \u03c1 and the single-qubit meter state (MS) |0\u27e9_m under the Hamiltonian \u0124=g\u03b4(t-t_0)\u0108_a,a^'\u2297\u03c3\u0302_y, where g is the coupling strength and \u03c3\u0302_y is the Pauli operator of the MS. The efficient observable \u0108_a,a^' is constructed through the Hadamard transformation H_a,a^' on the ordinary observable \u00d4_a,a^'=|a\u27e9\u27e8 a| - |a^'\u27e9\u27e8 a^'| of the QS, given by \u0108_a,a^' = \u0124_a,a^'\u00d4_a,a^'\u0124_a,a^'. After the coupling process \u00db = exp(-i\u222b\u0124dt), the system-meter joint state evolves to \u03c1_jt=\u00db\u03c1\u2297 |0\u27e9_m\u27e8 0| \u00db^\u2020. Since a pair of post-selection projectors \u03c0\u0302_a^' and \u03c0\u0302_a correspond to the conjugate operators M\u0302_a^',a and M\u0302_a,a^', we perform both post-selection on the QS and obtain the final meter states \u03c1_m,a^'=Tr_s[\u03c0\u0302_a^'\u2297_m\u03c1_jt] and \u03c1_m,a, respectively, with the subscript s denoting the partial trace on the QS. In this way, the density-matrix element derived by the weak average \u03c1_a,a^' = [Tr(M\u0302_a^',a\u03c1_jt) + Tr(M\u0302_a,a^'\u03c1_jt)']/2 can be extracted with the observables \u03c3\u0302_+ = \u03c3\u0302_x+i\u03c3\u0302_y and \u03c3\u0302_- =  \u03c3\u0302_x - i\u03c3\u0302_y of the post-selected meter states:\n\n    \u03c1_a,a^' = Tr(\u03c3\u0302_+\u03c1_m,a^') + Tr(\u03c3\u0302_-\u03c1_m,a)/2sin(2g).\n\n\nIn Fig. <ref> (B), we generalize our formalism to the direct characterization of N-qudit density matrix \u03c1^(N) = \u2211_\ud835\udcae,\ud835\udcae^'\u03c1^(N)_\ud835\udcae,\ud835\udcae^'|\ud835\udcae\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udcae^'|, where |\ud835\udcae\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udcae^'| = |a_1,...,a_N\u27e9\u27e8 a_1^',...,a_N^'| and |a_n\u27e9 refers to the eigenstate of nth qudit. To directly characterize the off-diagonal element \u03c1_\ud835\udcae,\ud835\udcae^', we decompose the operator M\u0302_\ud835\udcae^',\ud835\udcae = |\ud835\udcae^'\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udcae| (and its conjugate M\u0302_\ud835\udcae,\ud835\udcae^') to the joint efficient observable \u0108^(N) = \u2297_n=1^N\u0108_n and the post-selection projector \u03a0\u0302_\ud835\udcae^'^(N) = |\ud835\udcae^'\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udcae^'| (\u03a0\u0302_\ud835\udcae^(N)). The efficient observable \u0108_n for nth qudit is divided into two cases: (i) if a_j \u2260 a_j^', we choose \u0108_j = |a_j\u27e9\u27e8 a_j^'| +|a_j^'\u27e9\u27e8 a_j| and the coupling process is in analogy to the single-qudit situation; (ii) if a_k = a_k^', \u0108_k equals to _k and no coupling is required. The separate measurement of the observable \u0108_j on each qudit with the identical coupling strength g leads to the Hamiltonian \u0124^(N) = \u2211_a_j \u2260 a_j^' g\u03b4(t-t_0) \u0108_j\u2297\u03c3\u0302_y,j and the multiplied result yields the average value of \u0108^(N). Assuming that there are totally l independent couplings of N-qudit system, i.e., l terms in \u0124^(N), we get the joint state\n\n    \u03c1_jt^(N) = \u00db^(N)[ \u03c1^(N)\u2297 (|0\u27e9_m\u27e8 0|)^\u2297 l]  \u00db^(N)\u2020.\n\nwith the unitary \u00db^(N) = exp[-i\u222b\u0124^(N)dt]. The following post-selection \u03a0\u0302_\ud835\udcae^' or \u03a0\u0302_\ud835\udcae on the QS results in the final MS \u03c1_m,\ud835\udcae^' = Tr_s[\u03a0\u0302_\ud835\udcae^'\u2297^\u2297 l\u03c1_jt^(N)] or \u03c1_m,\ud835\udcae, respectively. The density-matrix element can be directly obtained by collective measurements on the MS:\n\n    \u03c1_\ud835\udcae,\ud835\udcae^'=Tr[\u2297_a_j \u2260 a_j^'\u03c3\u0302_+,j\u03c1_m,\ud835\udcae^'] + Tr[\u2297_a_j \u2260 a_j^'\u03c3\u0302_-,j\u03c1_m,\ud835\udcae]/2sin^l(2g).\n\n\nTo comprehensively evaluate the precision of the direct-characterization schemes, we analyze the statistical errors of the measured density-matrix elements with the quantum states uniformly sampled over the state space. Thus, the expected precision and the feasibility of the scheme can be inferred from the statistical distribution of errors. Due to the uniform sampling of single-qudit systems, both the real and the imaginary parts of all off-diagonal density-matrix elements stand on equal footing. Given that the sampled state \u03c1_d evolves from an initial state |0\u27e9\u27e8 0| = (1,0,...,0)^T(1,0,...,0) under the unitary transformation V\u2208 U(d), we define the mean precision of single-qudit characterization\n\n    \u0394^2_d = \u222b _V\u2208 U(d)\u03b4^2 \u03c1_d d\u03bc_d(V).\n\nby taking the integral of mean errors \u03b4^2 \u03c1_d = 1/d(d-1)\u2211_a=0,a<a^'^d-1 [\u03b4^2 Re(\u03c1_a,a^') + \u03b4^2 Im(\u03c1_a,a^')] with respect to Harr measure \u03bc_d(V). For N-qudit quantum systems, we start with the maximally entangled state, e.g., |\u03a8_0\u27e9 = 1/\u221a(d)\u2211_j=0^d-1 |a_j\u27e9_1...|a_j\u27e9_N and let nth qudit evolve under the unitary V_n\u2208 U(d) to acquire the arbitrary sampling state |\u03a8_E\u27e9 = \u2297_n=1^N V_n |\u03a8_0\u27e9. We focus on the density-matrix elements \u03c1^(N)_\ud835\udcae,\ud835\udcae^' satisfying a_n \u2260 a_n^' for all n since such elements imply the coherence information among all particles. Therefore, we can get the mean precision of N-qudit characterization:\n\n    \u0394^2_N,d = _V_n \u2208 U_n(d)\u03b4^2 \u03c1^(N)\u220f_n=1^N d\u03bc_d(V_n),\n\nwhere \u03b4^2 \u03c1^(N) = 2^N-1/d^N(d-1)^N\u2211_\u2200 n, a_n\u2260 a_n^'{\u03b4^2 Re[\u03c1^(N)_\ud835\udcae,\ud835\udcae^'] + \u03b4^2 Im[\u03c1^(N)_\ud835\udcae,\ud835\udcae^']}.\n\nExperiment.\u2013The experimental setup for the preparation and direct characterization of single-qutrit states \u03c1_T is shown in Fig. <ref> (B). The heralded single photons generated in module (A) input S1 port and sequentially pass through a half-wave plate (HWP), a quarter-wave plate (QWP) and a polarizer to initialize the polarization to the horizontal state |H\u27e9. By referring to the optical paths {up, middle, bottom} as basis {|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9, |2\u27e9}, we prepare the pure qutrit state |\u03c8_T\u27e9 =  cos 2\u03b8_1 cos 2\u03b8_2 |0\u27e9 + cos2\u03b8_1sin 2\u03b8_2e^i\u03d5_2 |1\u27e9 + sin 2\u03b8_1e^i(\u03d5_1+\u03d5_2) |2\u27e9 with the HWPs at \u03b8_1, \u03b8_2 and the phase retarders (PRs) at \u03d5_1, \u03d5_2 realizing polarization transformation as well as the polarizing beam displacers (PBDs) implementing beam splitting <cit.>. Additionally, the mixed states can be obtained by probabilistic mixture of specific pure states <cit.>. In the two boxes labelled `\u0124_a,a^'', we perform the Hadamard transformations of qutrits \u0124_a,a^' with the realization shown in blow dotted blocks <cit.>. After the first Hadamard transformation, we initialize the polarization of photons at all paths to |H\u27e9 as the MS. The interaction Hamiltonian \u0124=g\u03b4(t-t_0) \u00d4_a,a^'\u2297\u03c3\u0302_y is realized by rotating the HWPs at the path a (a^') to g/2 (-g/2) degrees. Given that both the Hadamard transformation and the post-selection on QS are commutable with the measurement of the MS, we first perform projective measurements on the MS with the combination of a QWP, a HWP and a polarizer. After the second Hadamard transformation, the distribution of photons at detectors D1, D2 and D3 are collected for the post-selection of the QS.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Fig. <ref> (C), we directly characterize the arbitrary two-photon entangled states \u03c1_E by inputting two photons into S1 and S2 ports, respectively. Both photons undergo two identical setups in the dotted box `(M)' but the configuration depends on the density-matrix element of interest. Here, the polarization degree of freedom of photons is referred to as the QS. The first group of a QWP, a HWP and a QWP is used for compensating the polarization changes in fiber transmission <cit.>. Then, the arbitrary unitary transformation \u00db_1(2) on the polarization is realized with a group of a QWP, a HWP and a QWP <cit.>. The subsequent HWP (as well as the last HWP) at 22.5^\u2218 implements the Hadamard transformation on the polarization qubit. To facilitate the coupling between the QS and the MS, we transform the polarization information of photons to the path information through a PBD and the polarization of photons is used as the MS. The coupling operation and measurements on the MS are in analogy to the single-qutrit experiment. The coincidence rates, such as D4&D6, D4&D7, D5&D6 and D5&D7, are collected for the corresponding post-selection.\n\nResults.\u2013The directly measured density-matrix elements of qutrit states during the unitary and dephasing processes are shown in Fig. <ref> (A) and (B), respectively. In the unitary evolution, we set the parameters \u03b8_1 = arcsin(\u221a(1/3))/2, \u03b8_2 = \u03c0/8, \u03d5_1 = \u03d5_2 + \u03c0/3 and vary \u03d5_2 from \u03c0/3 to 4\u03c0/3. By mixing specific pure states with different probability distribution, we equivalently let an original state \u03c1_T,0 with \u03d5_2 = 2\u03c0/3 undergo the dephasing process \ud835\udca9(|a\u27e9\u27e8 a^'|) = \u03b3 |a\u27e9\u27e8 a^' |, in which the off-diagonal elements are decreased to \u03b3\u27e8 a|\u03c1_T,0|a^'\u27e9 <cit.>. In direct characterization of two-qubit systems, the two-photon entangled state \u03c1_E = |\u03c8_E\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8_E| is prepared by evolving one of the bell states |\u03c8_b\u27e9 = (|H\u27e9|V\u27e9 + |V\u27e9|H\u27e9) /\u221a(2) under the composed unitary \u00db_1(2)\u2297\u00db_2(2) with \u00db_n(2) = [ cos 2\u03b8_n e^-i\u03d5_n1 -sin 2\u03b8_n e^i\u03d5_n1; sin 2\u03b8_n e^-i\u03d5_n2  cos 2\u03b8_n e^i\u03d5_n1 ]. In Fig. <ref> (C), we illustrate the measured anti-diagonal elements of the density matrix \u27e8 00|\u03c1_E|11\u27e9 and  \u27e8 01|\u03c1_E|10\u27e9 with the parameters \u03b8_11 = \u03c0/8, \u03b8_21=\u03d5_21=\u03d5_22 = 0, \u03d5_12 = \u03d5_11+\u03c0/4 and varying \u03d5_11 from 0 to \u03c0. In the following, the original state |\u03c8_E,0\u27e9 with \u03d5_11=\u03c0/3 is chosen to evolve under the dephasing process \ud835\udca9(|\ud835\udcae\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udcae^'|) = \u03b3 |\ud835\udcae\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udcae^'| realized by appropriately mixing certain unitary operations \u00db_1(2) and \u00db_2(2) <cit.>. The experimental results of anti-diagonal elements \u27e8 00|\u03c1_E|11\u27e9 and \u27e8 01|\u03c1_E|10\u27e9 in dephasing process are shown in Fig. <ref> (D). The error bars are smaller than the data points.\n\nIn Fig. <ref>, the precision of the RES and that of sequential scheme are compared with different coupling strength g. By assuming the total number of single photons or photon pairs per unit time n_t subjecting to Poisson distribution, we theoretically derive the mean precision of direct characterization with single copy of state n_t\u0394^2_T  and n_t\u0394^2_E for qutrit states and two-photon entangled states, respectively <cit.>. In the experiment, we randomly generate one hundred single-qutrit states |\u03c8_T\u27e9 = \u00db(3)|0\u27e9 or two-photon polarization states |\u03c8_E\u27e9 with the unitary operators \u00db(3), \u00db_1(2) and \u00db_2(2) sampled according to Harr measure. The experimental precision are obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation based on the raw data. The results show that the precision of both direct characterization schemes is improved with stronger coupling strength g. The optimal precision of the RES in characterizing both qutrits (g=\u03c0/4, n_t\u0394^2_T = 0.125) and entangled states (g=\u03c0/4, n_t\u0394^2_E = 0.208) is overall better than that of the sequential schemes with qutrits (g=\u03c0/2, n_t\u0394^2_T = 0.708) and entangled states (g=\u03c0/2, n_t\u0394^2_E = 0.458).\n\nDiscussion and conclusions.\u2013From the insets (a) to (d) of Fig. <ref>, the statistical errors are non divergent confirming the feasibility of our scheme in characterizing the arbitrary quantum states. In weak-measurement scenario (i.e., g\u2192 0), the precision of the RES is several orders of magnitude better than that of sequential schemes with the ratio following g^2N for N-qudit systems. This advantage endows our scheme with better potential in studying weak-measurement problems, e.g., share of non-locality <cit.>, error-disturbance relationship <cit.> and etc <cit.>. With the qubit meter states used for the direct characterization of N-qudit systems, 2^2N or 2^3N projective measurements are typically performed for the resource-efficient or sequential schemes, respectively. Provided that the efficiency of direct characterization schemes is quantitatively compared by counting the total number of photons (or the equivalent time consumption) to achieve the same precision, the mean efficiency of the optimal RES is 11.3 or 8.8 times higher than that of the optimized sequential schemes for qutrit states or two-photon states, respectively.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we propose a RES which can be practically used to directly characterize the density matrix of general multi-qudit quantum systems. Compared to the multiple coupling operations in sequential schemes, our protocol only requires one coupling process to measure an efficient observable for each qudit in extracting a specific density-matrix element. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of the RES over sequential schemes by directly characterizing single-qutrit states and two-photon entangled states with fewer measurements and better precision. These advantages will be significantly enhanced as the particle number increases in weak coupling scenario. When both the resource-efficient and sequential schemes are optimized in terms of precision over the coupling strength, the former scheme still demonstrates the efficiency advantage over the latter by about an order of magnitude. Our work provides a promising approach for the characterization and exploration of large-scale quantum systems with broad extension from integrated photonic chip to other physical systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work was supported by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grants No. 2022M722918, No. 2021M702976, No. 2020TQ0297 and No. 2020M681949), International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program 2022 (Grant No. PC2022049), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 12204437, No. 61975077, No. 12075245,  No. 12247105 and No. 92265114), the Center initiated Research Project of Zhejiang Lab (Grant No. 2021MB0AL01), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (Grant No. 2021JJ10033), Xiaoxiang Scholars Project of Hunan Normal university, the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grants No. 2018YFA0306202 and No. 2019YFA0308704) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 020414380175).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\nfxundefined [1]\n ifx#1\n\nfnum [1]\n #1firstoftwo\n secondoftwo\n \nfx [1]\n #1firstoftwo\n secondoftwo\n \n\n\n\n\n\nnoop [0]secondoftwo\n\nref[1]@startlink#1@href\nhref[1]#1@endlink\nanitize@url [0]`\n12`$12`&12`#12`1\u03022`_12`%12\nstartlink[1]\nendlink[0]\n\nrl [1]href #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@bib@innerbibempty\n\n[Horodecki et\u00a0al.(2009)Horodecki, Horodecki, Horodecki, and  Horodecki]horodecki2009quantum\n  author author R.\u00a0Horodecki, author P.\u00a0Horodecki, author M.\u00a0Horodecki, and author K.\u00a0Horodecki, @noop  journal journal\n  Rev.
