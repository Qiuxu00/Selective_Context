We formulate the boundary value problem on a 3-dimensional compact and simply connected Riemannian manifold M with boundary \u2202 M endowed with a Riemannian metric g. Assuming that the electric permittivity \u03b5 and magnetic permeability \u03bc are real-valued anisotropic (i.e (1,1)- tensors), we aim to determine certain metrics induced by these parameters, denoted by \u03b5\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302 at \u2202 M. We show that the knowledge of the impedance and admittance maps determines the tangential entries of \u03b5\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302 at \u2202 M in their boundary normal coordinates, although the background volume form cannot be determined in such coordinates due to a non-uniqueness occuring from diffeomorphisms that fix the boundary. Then, we prove that in some cases, we can also recover the normal components of \u03bc\u0302 up to a conformal multiple at \u2202 M in boundary normal coordinates for \u03b5\u0302. Last, we build an inductive proof to show that if \u03b5\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302 are determined at \u2202 M in boundary normal coordinates for \u03b5\u0302, then the same follows for their normal derivatives of all orders at \u2202 M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n    [\n    March 30, 2023\n==================\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn this work, we consider a 3-dimensional compact and simply connected Riemannian manifold M,  with smooth boundary \u2202 M, equipped with a Riemannian metric g. In the case of M \u2282 \u211d^3, g could be the Euclidean metric. The coordinate invariant formulation of time harmonic Maxwell's equations, in the absence of currents or sources, in M is provided by\n\n    \u2217_gdH= -i \u03c9\u03b5 E,   \u03b4_g (\u03b5 E)= 0,\n    \u2217_gdE= i \u03c9\u03bc H,   \u03b4_g (\u03bc H)= 0,\n\nwhere \u2217_g is the Hodge star operator with respect to the metric g and d stands for the exterior derivative. The operator \u03b4_g denotes the divergence operator with respect to the  metric g.  The electric and magnetic fields E and H, respectively, are differential 1-forms. The electric permittivity \u03b5 and magnetic permeability \u03bc are assumed to be real-valued (1,1)-tensor fields which are symmetric and positive definite with respect to the metric g. The angular frequency is represented by \u03c9 and is a real number.\n\nWe consider either of the Dirichlet boundary conditions\n\n    \u03b9^\u2217H=F     \u03b9^\u2217E=G,\n\nwhere \u03b9^\u2217 stands for the pullback at \u2202 M. Given that the Dirichlet problem composed of (<ref>) and either boundary condition in (<ref>) is well-posed, the boundary mappings \u039b_\u03b5 and \u039b_\u03bc, called the impedance and admittance maps respectively are well defined and are provided by\n\n    \u039b_\u03b5(\u03b9^\u2217H)=\u03b9^\u2217E     \u039b_\u03bc(\u03b9^\u2217E)=\u03b9^\u2217H.\n\nNote that \u039b_\u03bc is the inverse of \u039b_\u03b5.\nAssuming the knowledge of \u039b_\u03b5 and \u039b_\u03bc we aim to recover the metrics induced by \u03b5 and \u03bc on the cotangent bundle of M, denoted by \u03b5^\u266f and \u03bc^\u266f, as well as their normal derivatives at \u2202 M. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Literature Review\n\n\nThe inverse problem of recovering a Riemannian metric using boundary data has been widely studied for the wave equation. The boundary measurements in this case are realised by the Dirichlet to Neumann (DtN) map. A natural obstruction to the uniqueness of the reconstruction, also mentioned as \u201ccloaking\", is encountered in this type of inverse problems and is caused by diffeomorphisms that fix the boundary <cit.>, <cit.>.\nThe article <cit.> studies the inverse problem of reconstructing a Riemannian manifold through the DtN map for the wave equation.  The Dirichlet boundary conditions represent the sources and they are located in an open subset of the boundary S. The Neumann boundary conditions which represent the waves produced by the sources in S, are being observed in R, which is an open subset of the boundary, with S\u2229R=\u2205. The method employed to solve this inverse problem uses arguments of the boundary control method. Applications of the boundary control method are given in <cit.> which concerns inverse problems in acoustics, elasticity, electrodynamics, electrical impedance tomography and graph theory.\n\nWell-posedness results for the time harmonic Maxwell's equations are given in <cit.> in the case of isotropic electromagnetic parameters and in <cit.> in the case of anisotropic electromagnetic parameters that are conformal multiples. Both the isotropic and anisotropic cases are considered in <cit.> where a coercive billinear form for the decoupled system is constructed. The time domain is also taken into account in <cit.> and the well-posedness is proved for non-analytic anisotropic parameters that are conformal multiples of each other. In this paper, we prove well-posedness for the equations considered by augmenting Maxwell's system to an elliptic one. Further details are provided later in sections <ref> and <ref>.\n\nThe linearized inverse boundary value problem of Maxwell's equations is studied in <cit.>. The electric permittivity, conductivity and magnetic permeability are assumed to be functions that differ slightly from given constants and they are recovered through the admittance map.\n The case of isotropic (scalar) electromagnetic parameters is also considered in <cit.>. In this case the Maxwell's system can be decoupled to derive a second order differential equation in terms of the Laplace-Beltrami operator either with respect to the magnetic field or the electric field. Using the calculus of Pseudodifferential Operators <cit.>, <cit.> the symbols of the admittance and impedance maps are determined in terms of a pseudodifferential operator of order 1 that factorises the Laplace-Beltrami operator. It is shown that this implies the boundary recovery of the electric permittivity \u03b5 and magnetic permeability \u03bc and their first normal derivatives. This result is extended in <cit.> where the demonstration of an inductive proof establishes the boundary determination of the normal derivatives of all orders of the electromagnetic parameters. This method uses a special class of Pseudodifferential Operators that depends smoothly on the distance from the boundary. Similar reasoning is followed in <cit.> for the inverse problem of the Laplacian on k-forms where the boundary data are represented by the DtN operator.\n \n A different approach on the inverse problem of time harmonic Maxwell's equations for scalar electromagnetic parameters is demonstrated in <cit.>. The principal symbols of the impedance and admittance maps are derived using a boundary operator called the Calderon projector for an augmented system equivalent to the Maxwell's system. \n The isotropic inverse problem for the time harmonic Maxwell's equations is also studied in <cit.> where the medium is a subset of \u211d^3 and is assumed to be chiral. In this method the magnetic permeability is known and the recovery of the electric permittivity, conductivity and chirality constant throughout the medium of interest is proven. The augmented system used in <cit.> to construct solutions for this system and use complex geometrical optics, is also used in the present work to establish well-posedness.  The inverse problem for the metrics induced by \u03b5 and \u03bc being (0,2)-tensors and conformal multiples of each other is studied in <cit.>. To the best of our knowledge, <cit.> is the only anisotropic case regarding the recovery of \u03b5 and \u03bc studied in the existing literature.\n \n The article <cit.> concerns the anisotropic conductivity problem. The method employed is the same factorisation method used for the isotropic case of the time harmonic Maxwell's equations in <cit.>. In the case of the dimension n satisfying n\u2265 3 the conductivity problem can be reduced to the problem of recovering a Riemannian metric g using the DtN map for harmonic functions. \nThe same factorisation method is also applied to the elasticity problem for transversely isotropic materials in  <cit.>. The elasticity operator, which is a second order elliptic operator, is factorised in terms of a pseudodifferential operator of order 1 making use of the theory of monic matrix polynomials <cit.>. The aforementioned operator is used to express the DtN map which yields to the recovery of the elastic parameters at the boundary. This is the approach that we follow in this paper in order to calculate the principal symbols of the boundary mappings.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Summary of Current Work\n\n \nNow let us describe the contents of the present work. We start in section <ref> by introducing the background material and notation including new metrics \u03b5\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302 which are conformally related to \u03b5^\u266f and \u03bc^\u266f but also eliminate the dependence of Maxwell's equations on g. Then follows section <ref>, where we state our main results. In order to show that the impedance and admittance maps are well defined we start in section <ref> by illustrating the proof of well-posedness of the forward problem. To do so, we augment the Maxwell's system to an 8 \u00d7 8 elliptic system also used in <cit.> and <cit.>. The basic step, following <cit.>, is to prove a coercivity estimate for the elliptic operator of the system.\n\nIn section <ref>, we start by defining the impedance and admittance maps. \nFirst, we study two types of non-uniqueness that arise from diffeomorphisms that fix the boundary. We show that if (\u03b5\u0302,\u03bc\u0302),  (\u03b5\u0302',\u03bc\u0302') are two different sets of metrics connected by such a diffeomorphism \u03a6 then the boundary data of the corresponding Dirichlet problems are the same.\nNext, we examine the consequences of a diffeomorphism \u03a6 that fixes the boundary to the recovery of the determinant of the metric g, denoted by | g|, in boundary normal coordinates for \u03b5^\u266f and \u03bc^\u266f. We prove that the Jacobian determinant | D\u03a6| of this diffeomorphism can be arbitrary in boundary coordinates and as a result, the determinant | g | cannot be uniquely determined in either boundary normal coordinates for \u03b5^\u266f or \u03bc^\u266f. This affects the boundary recovery of \u03b5^\u266f and \u03bc^\u266f as we show in section <ref>.\n\n In section <ref> we decouple the system and follow <cit.> together with the theory of monic matrix polynomials <cit.> to derive the principal symbols of the factorisation operators denoted by B(x,D_x\u0303) and C(x,D_x\u0303) representing the normal derivatives in coordinates. Next, we express the principal symbols of the impedance and admittance maps through the principal symbols of B and C. Proceeding to section <ref>, we show that the principal symbols of \u039b_\u03b5 and \u039b_\u03bc determine the tangential entries of the metrics \u03b5\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302. Next, investigating the consequences of the boundary recovery on the electric and magnetic fields, we prove that in some cases we can recover the normal components of \u03bc\u0302 in boundary normal coordinates for \u03b5\u0302. Under the same choice of coordinates, we show that when boundary recovery of the metrics \u03b5\u0302, \u03bc\u0302 is possible, the boundary recovery of their normal derivatives of all orders is implied. This is done by adjusting to our case the inductive proof employed in <cit.> and <cit.> that uses Riccati equations satisfied by B(x, D_x\u0303), C(x,D_x\u0303) together with a class of pseudodifferential operators that allows us to work exclusively with principal symbols at the boundary.\n \n \n\n\u00a7 BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n\n \n Let us introduce some prerequisites from tensor calculus that will be needed in the following sections. Further details on the topic are given in <cit.>.\n We will denote by \u03c4_n^m(M) the spaces of smooth (n,m)- complex valued tensor fields on M. The Riemmanian g induces a point-wise billinear form \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9_g on these spaces. Also, we introduce the space \u03a9^k(M) that consists of the smooth complex-valued differential k-forms. \n For a,b \u2208 \u03a9^k(M) we will write the point-wise inner product of a with b as \u27e8 a, b\u0305\u27e9_g.  \n For a,b \u2208 \u03a9^1(M) we express \u27e8 a, b\u0305\u27e9_g in a local coordinate chart as\n \n    \u27e8 a, b\u0305\u27e9_g= g^aba_ab\u0305_b,\n\n which induces the norm \u27e8 a, a\u0305\u27e9_g^1/2.\n Note carefully that, in our notation, for complex valued fields the bilinear form \u27e8 a,b \u27e9_g is not an inner-product because we do not include the conjugation. Indeed, in local coordinates it is written as\n \n    \u27e8 a, b \u27e9_g= g^aba_ab_b.\n\n Furthermore, we will write | a | _g^2 = \u27e8 a, a \u27e9_g, which for complex a does not give a norm.\n \n \n The purpose of excluding the conjugation from \u27e8 a, b \u27e9_g and | a | _g^2 is that in what follows we will make use of the fact that | a | _g^2 can vanish for complex a. When we reach this point, the reader is reminded with a remark (see Remark <ref>).\n \n \n The inner product on L^2(\u03a9^k(M)) is given by\n \n    \u27e8\u27e8 a,b\u0305\u27e9\u27e9 _g= \u222b_M a \u2227\u2217_gb\u0305,\n\n where a,b \u2208 \u03a9^k(M). In what follows, we will also use inner products defined as above but with g replaced by metrics induced from the electromagnetic parameters \u03b5 and \u03bc.\n Using the Levi-Civita connection on (M,g), denoted by \u2207, we define the spaces H^1(\u03a9^k(M)) as \n \n    H^1(\u03a9^k(M))= {a \u2208 L^2(\u03a9^k(M));   \u2207 a \u2208 L^2(\u03c4_k+1^0(M))},\n\n equipped with the norm\n \n    a  _H^1(\u03a9^k(M))^2=  a  _L^2(\u03a9^k(M))^2+ \u2207 a _L^2(\u03c4_k+1^0(M))^2.\n\n Let \u03b9: \u2202 M \u21a6 M be the inclusion map at the boundary and define the pullback \u03b9^\u2217: \u03a9^k(M) \u21a6\u03a9^k(\u2202 M) on smooth differential forms. The pullback can be extended by continuity to \u03b9^\u2217: H^1(\u03a9^k(M))\u21a6 H^1/2(\u03a9^k(\u2202 M)).\n The definition of H^1/2 and in general fractional Sobolev spaces is given in section 4.1 of <cit.>, in terms of the Fourier transform.\n Moreover, we define the Sobolev space H_0^1(\u03a9^k(M)) as\n \n    H_0^1(\u03a9^k( M))= { a \u2208 H^1(\u03a9^k(M));   \u03b9^\u2217a=0}.\n\n  The (1,1)-tensors \u03b5 and \u03bc are assumed to be smooth and real valued. We interpret them as point-wise maps on the cotangent bundle T^\u2217(M) and assume that they are symmetric and positive definite with respect to g. For a,b \u2208 T_x^\u2217(M) these properties are described by, respectively,\n \n    \u27e8 a, \u03b5b\u0305\u27e9_g = \u27e8\u03b5 a, b\u0305\u27e9_g,  \u27e8 a, \u03bcb\u0305\u27e9_g = \u27e8\u03bc a, b\u0305\u27e9_g,\n \n \n    \u27e8 a, \u03b5a\u0305\u27e9_g >0,   \u27e8 a, \u03bca\u0305\u27e9_g >0\n\n Due to the above, \u03b5, \u03bc and their inverses \u03b5^-1, \u03bc^-1 induce metrics on the cotangent and tangent bundles T^\u2217(M) and T(M), respectively. The metrics on T^\u2217(M) induced by \u03b5 and \u03bc are (2,0)-tensors and using the \u266f (raising indices) operator are provided in a local coordinate by\n \n    \u03b5^\u266f=\u03b5^ij=g^ik\u03b5_k^j,   \u03bc^\u266f=\u03bc^ij=g^ik\u03bc_k^j.\n\nWe will write the inverses of \u03b5^\u266f and \u03bc^\u266f using the \u266d (lowering indices) operator as\n \n    (\u03b5^-1)_\u266d=(\u03b5^-1)_ij=g_ik(\u03b5^-1)_j^k,    (\u03bc^-1)_\u266d=(\u03bc^-1)_ij=g_ik(\u03bc^-1)_j^k.\n\nNote that we will often use the term metric both for Riemannian metrics, which are (0,2)-tensors and induce a bilinear form on T(M), as well as for (2,0)-tensors and the corresponding bilinear forms on T^\u2217(M).\n\n \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Notation and identities\n\n Let us introduce the notation used in this paper. We are working in a set of coordinates adapted to the boundary \u2202 M characterised by x_3=0 within the domain of the coordinate chart. These will be boundary normal coordinates either for \u03b5^\u266f, \u03bc^\u266f or the related metrics \u03b5\u0302, \u03bc\u0302 introduced in (<ref>). Since we are working on a 3-d manifold, the indices of tensor fields i are assumed to take values from 1 to 3. In the case of an index restricted to i=1,2, we will add a tilde as in \u0129 .\n When working with coordinate invariant expressions we will use the notation \u03be\u0303 for the covector\n \n    \u03be_\u0129 dx^\u0129 = \u2211_\u0129=1^2  \u03be_\u0129 dx^\u0129.\n\n If \u03bd=  dx^3 is a covector normal to the boundary, we will denote by \u03be a covector that is written in components as\n \n    \u03be=\u03be\u0303+\u03bd\u03be_3.\n\n The determinants of the Riemannian metrics g, (\u03b5^-1)_\u266d and (\u03bc^-1)_\u266d in coordinates will be written as\n \n    | g | :=(g),   |\u03b5^-1|:=((\u03b5^-1)_\u266d),   |\u03bc^-1|:=((\u03bc^-1)_\u266d).\n\n The corresponding notation for the determinants of the metrics on T^\u2217(M) is\n \n    | g^-1|:=(g^-1),   |\u03b5|:=(\u03b5^\u266f),   |\u03bc|:=(\u03bc^\u266f).\n\nDenoting by \u03c3^ijk the alternating tensor will use the following identities for the metric g^-1\n \n    | g^-1|\u03c3^pqr=\u03c3_ijkg^pig^qjg^rk,\n\n and for the matrix of cofactors of the Riemannian metric g \n \n    \u03c3^aqj\u03c3^dkbg_bj= | g | (g^adg^qk-g^akg^qd).\n\n We define new Riemannian metrics \u03b5\u0302^-1 and \u03bc\u0302^-1 by\n  \n    \u03b5\u0302^-1/\u221a(|\u03b5\u0302^-1|)= (\u03b5^-1)_\u266d/\u221a(| g |),   \u03bc\u0302^-1/\u221a(|\u03bc\u0302^-1|)= (\u03bc^-1)_\u266d/\u221a(| g |),\n\n which allow us to write the time harmonic Maxwell's equations as given in (<ref>)\n in the equivalent form\n \n    \u2217_\u03b5\u0302dH   = -i \u03c9 E,   \u03b4_\u03b5\u0302  E= 0,\n    \u2217_\u03bc\u0302dE   = i \u03c9  H,   \u03b4_\u03bc\u0302 H= 0,\n\n that is independent of g.  When working with the metrics (<ref>), we will denote the associated impedance and admittance maps by \u039b_\u03b5\u0302, \u039b_\u03bc\u0302, respectively. The approach we follow is to work with two different pairs of metrics (\u03b5\u0302,\u03bc\u0302), (\u03b5\u0302',\u03bc\u0302') and boundary mappings \u039b_\u03b5\u0302, \u039b_\u03bc\u0302 and \u039b_\u03b5\u0302', \u039b_\u03bc\u0302' to investigate the implications of the assumption \u039b_\u03b5\u0302=\u039b_\u03b5\u0302', \u039b_\u03bc\u0302=\u039b_\u03bc\u0302'. \n We will use the phrases \u201cboundary normal coordinates for \u03b5\u0302/\u03b5\u0302'\" and \u201cboundary normal coordinates for \u03bc\u0302/\u03bc\u0302'\" to express that we work separately in boundary normal coordinates for either the metrics \u03b5\u0302 and \u03b5\u0302' or \u03bc\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302'. Assume that the representations of \u03b5\u0302 and \u03b5\u0302' in boundary normal coordinates for \u03b5\u0302/\u03b5\u0302' at x_3=0 are given by, respectively\n \n    (\u03b5\u0303   0\n    \n     0^T    1\n     ),   (\u03b5\u0303'   0\n    \n     0^T    1\n     ).\n\n Assume further that \u03bc\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302' in boundary normal coordinates for \u03bc\u0302/\u03bc\u0302' at x_3=0 are written as\n \n    (\u03bc\u0303   0\n    \n     0^T    1\n     ),   (\u03bc\u0303'   0\n    \n     0^T    1\n     ).\n\nNote that \u03b5\u0303, \u03b5\u0303', \u03bc\u0303 and \u03bc\u0303' define coordinate invariant metrics on \u2202 M. These are the tangential parts of  \u03b5\u0302, \u03b5\u0302', \u03bc\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302' respectively.\n\nAs mentioned in Section <ref>, we are going to use the calculus of Pseudodifferential Operators (\u03a8 DOs) to determine the principal symbols of the boundary mappings \u039b_\u03b5\u0302 and \u039b_\u03bc\u0302. Using the Fourier transform and its inverse, P is a pseudodifferential operator of order m (P \u2208\u03a8 DO^(m)) in local coordinates if\n\n    P(x,D_x)u(x)= 1/(2\u03c0)^3\u222b_\u211d^3 e^i x \u00b7\u03be p(x,\u03be)\u00fb(\u03be)  d\u03be,\n\nwhere D_x= - i \u2202_x, \u00fb(\u03be) denotes the Fourier transform of u(x) and p(x,\u03be) is called the symbol of P(x,D_x) and is of order m with respect to the dual variable \u03be.

Since the methods are fairly standard and well-known, we only give a sketch of this proof.\n\nTo begin, we augment the system (<ref>) to\n\n    PU=\t-i  (\n    \n    i \u03c9    0    \u03b4_\u03bc\u0302    0 \n    \n    0     i \u03c9   \u2217_\u03b5\u0302d   d\n    d   -\u2217_\u03bc\u0302d    i \u03c9    0\n    \n    0    \u03b4_\u03b5\u0302    0     i \u03c9 )\n     (\n    \n    u_E\n     E \n     H \n     u_H )\n    = \n     (\n    \n    0 \n     0 \n     0 \n     0\n     ),\n\nwhere u_E and u_H are auxiliary 0-forms. Note that if u_E=u_H=0, then E and H satisfying (<ref>) also satisfy (<ref>). The purpose of this step is that P is an elliptic operator, i.e its principal symbol is invertible for \u03be \u2208 \u211d^3\\{0}, in contrast to the operator corresponding to the system (<ref>). The field U is defined in \u03a9(M), where \n\n    \u03a9(M)= \u03a9^0(M) \u2295\u03a9^1(M) \u2295\u03a9^1(M) \u2295\u03a9^0(M)\n\nand the boundary condition is written in terms of U as\n\n    BU= ( \u03b9^\u2217   0   0   0\n    \n    0   0   0   0\n    \n    0   0   \u03b9^\u2217   0\n    \n    0   0   0   \u03b9^\u2217) (\n    \n    u_E\n     E \n     H \n     u_H )= (0\n    0\n    F\n    0  ).\n\nThe spaces L^2(\u03a9(M)) and H^1(\u03a9(M)) are defined using the inner products\nand norms given from the product structure\n\n    (U,V)   =\t\t\u222b_M( \n    u_E\n    \n    E\n    \n    H\n    \n    u_H)\u2227( \u2217_\u03bc\u0302   0   0   0\n    \n    0   \u2217_\u03b5\u0302   0   0\n    \n    0   0   \u2217_\u03bc\u0302   0\n    \n    0   0   0   \u2217_\u03b5\u0302)( u_E\n    E\n    H\n    u_H),\n\n\n    ( \n    u_E\n    \n    E\n    \n    H\n    \n    u_H)^2= u_E^2 + E^2+H^2+ u_H^2,\n\nwhere the norms are either L^2 or H^1.\nTransforming the boundary value problem consisting of (<ref>) and (<ref>) to the equivalent one with non-homogeneous differential equation and homogeneous Dirichlet condition we define the domain of P to be\n\n    D(P)= {U \u2208 H^1(\u03a9(M));    BU=0}.\n\nThe main step in the proof is to prove the following coercivity estimate which holds for any U \u2208 D(P) \n\n    U_H^1(\u03a9(M))^2\u2264 C PU_L^2(\u03a9(M))^2 + C U_L^2(\u03a9(M))^2,\n\nfor some C>0, depending on \u03b5\u0302, \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c9.  In <cit.> is shown that the ellipticity of P implies that (<ref>) holds in the interior of M. Thus, it remains to show that the estimate (<ref>) holds in a coordinate chart adapted to the boundary. Using the method in <cit.>, it suffices to show that P satisfies the hypothesis of regularity upon freezing the coefficients.   The only difference is that we consider the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of K_1(\u03be\u0303)+K_0 instead of K_1(\u03be\u0303) as denoted in the proof of <cit.> to accomodate the fact that the eigenvectors of K_1(\u03be\u0303) in our case do not satisfy <cit.>.\nNext, using the symmetry of P with respect to the  the L^2-product defined in (<ref>) and using the coercivity estimate we show that P is densely defined self-adjoint with compact resolvent. Hence, the set of eigenvalues of P is discrete. Finally, to obtain the result for the original time harmonic Maxwell's equations we must show that, for values of \u03c9 outside the spectrum, if u_E|_\u2202 M= u_H|_\u2202 M = 0 then u_E = u_H = 0. This is done by showing that u_E and u_H satisfy eigenvalue problems which can be decoupled from the augmented system.\n\n\n\u00a7 BOUNDARY MAPPINGS AND NON-UNIQUENESS RESULT\n\nThe fact that the boundary value problem with Dirichet condition on H is well-posed outside a discrete set of \u03c9 implies the corresponding result for the boundary value problem with Dirichlet condition\n\n    \u03b9^\u2217E=G.\n \nTherefore, we can define the impedance map \u039b_\u03b5\u0302: \u03a9^1(\u2202 M) \u21a6\u03a9^1(\u2202 M) realised by\n\n    \u039b_\u03b5\u0302(\u03b9^\u2217H)=\u03b9^\u2217E\n\nand its inverse \u039b_\u03bc\u0302:\u03a9^1(\u2202 M) \u21a6\u03a9^1(\u2202 M) given by\n\n    \u039b_\u03bc\u0302(\u03b9^\u2217E)=\u03b9^\u2217H\n\nwhich is called the admittance map.\n\nNext we study the non-uniqueness implied by diffeomorphisms \u03a6 that fix the boundary and thus prove Theorem <ref>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Proof of Theorem <ref>\n\n\nLet us consider the sets of metrics (\u03b5\u0302,\u03bc\u0302) and (\u03b5\u0302',\u03bc\u0302') connected by a diffeomorphism \u03a6: M\u21a6 M with \u03a6|_\u2202 M= \ud835\udd40 as\n\n    \u03b5\u0302= \u03a6^\u2217\u03b5\u0302',   \u03bc\u0302=\u03a6^\u2217\u03bc\u0302'.\n\nBecause of the coordinate invariant form of (<ref>), the action of \u03a6 on the magnetic field H is\n\n    H= (D\u03a6)^TH'\n\nand since \u03a6|_\u2202 M= \ud835\udd40 we get \u03b9^\u2217H=\u03b9^\u2217H'. The same is also true for the electrial field: \u03b9^\u2217E=\u03b9^\u2217E'.\nTherefore the impedance maps corresponding to the \u03b5\u0302, \u03b5\u0302' metrics satisfy\n\n    \u039b_\u03b5\u0302(\u03b9^\u2217H)=\u039b_\u03b5\u0302'(\u03b9^\u2217H).\n\nHence, the metrics (\u03b5\u0302,\u03bc\u0302) and (\u03b5\u0302',\u03bc\u0302') lead to the same boundary data, which implies the same for the metrics (\u03b5^\u266f,\u03bc^\u266f,g) and (\u03b5'^\u266f,\u03bc'^\u266f,g) defined through (<ref>).\n\nTo complete the proof of Theorem <ref> we need the following Lemma.\n\n\nSuppose that {x^j}_j=1^3 are a set of local boundary coordinates on a domain U \u2282 M and take any positive function h \u2208 C^\u221e(M) such that supp(h-1) \u2282 U. Then there exists a diffeomorphism \u03a6:M \u21a6 M such that\n\t\n    \u03a6|_\u2202 M=\ud835\udd40\n\nand in the local coordinates the Jacobian determinant satisfies | D\u03a6| = h for all x^3 sufficiently small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will assume without loss of generality that\n\n    supp(h-1) \u2282{(x^1,x^2,x^3) \u2208 [-\u03f5,\u03f5]\u00d7[-\u03f5,\u03f5]\u00d7 [0,\u03f5]}\u2282 U.\n\nfor some \u03f5 >0. Let \u03d5\u2208 C^\u221e_c(\u211d) be an even function satisfying 0\u2264\u03d5\u2264 1, supp(\u03d5) \u2282 (-1,1), \u03d5(s) = 1 for s in a neighourhood of zero and \u222b_-\u221e^\u221e\u03d5(s)  d s =1. Also set\n\n    a = 4 sup{ h+1} + 3,    b = 2\u03f5/a (  sup{ h+1} + 1 ),    c = 2 \u03f5/asup{ h+1},\n\n\n    d(x^1,x^2) = 1/c\u222b_0^\u221e (h(x^1,x^2,s)-1) \u03d5 ( as/\u03f5 )  d s.\n\nThen we define \u03a6 within U by\n\t\n    \u03a6(x^1,x^2,x^3)= (x^1,x^2, f(x^1,x^2,x^3)),\n\n\twith\n\n    f(x^1,x^2,x^3)=\u222b_0^x^3 (h(x^1,x^2,s)-1)\u03d5 (as/\u03f5 ) - d(x^1,x^2) \u03d5 ( s-b/c ) +1 ds.\n\nWith this construction, we see first that f(x^1,x^2,x^3) satisfies f(x^1,x^2,0)=0 which implies that\n\u03a6|_\u2202 M= \ud835\udd40. Also, noting that the support of the first and second terms in the integrand on the right side of (<ref>) is contained in {s \u2208 [0,\u03f5]} we can conclude\n\n    \u2202 f/\u2202 x^3(x^1,x^2,x^3) =  (h(x^1,x^2,x^3)-1)\u03d5 (ax^3/\u03f5 ) - d(x^1,x^2) \u03d5 ( x^3-b/c ) +1 > 0\n\neverywhere and f(x^1,x^2,x^3) = x^3 for (x^1,x^2,x^3) \u2209 [-\u03f5,\u03f5]\u00d7[-\u03f5,\u03f5]\u00d7 [0,\u03f5]. Thus, \u03a6 can be extended as the identity outside U to give a diffeomorphism on M with Jacobian matrix given within U by\n\t\n    D\u03a6= (\n    \t1   0    0\n    \n    \t0   1   0\n    \u2202 f/\u2202 x^1   \u2202 f/\u2202 x^2   \u2202 f/\u2202 x^3).\n\nFrom (<ref>), we see that \u2202 f/\u2202 x^3 = h when x^3 is sufficiently small, and so the Jacobian determinant is | D\u03a6| = h for all such x^3. This completes the proof.\n\n\nNow let us proceed to the proof of the second part of Theorem <ref> using the diffeomorphism \u03a6 constructed in Lemma <ref> in (<ref>). Given a set of coordinates on the boundary, let \u03a8, \u03a8' be the corresponding coordinate transformations from M to boundary normal coordinates for \u03b5\u0302 and \u03b5\u0302', respectively. Let us denote by \u011d and \u011d' the local representations of the metric g in boundary normal coordinates for \u03b5\u0302/\u03b5\u0302'. Then, referring to Figure <ref> and using the fact that \u03a8=\u03a8' \u2218\u03a6, we deduce that \n\n    |\u011d|=| D\u03a6|^-2|\u011d'|.\n\n\tUsing the result of Lemma <ref>, that | D\u03a6| can be an arbitrary positive function in a neighbourhood of the boundary, we conclude that the expression for the volume form of g in boundary normal coordinates for \u03b5\u0302 cannot be determined from \u039b_\u03b5\u0302. \n\t\nTo complete the proof of Theorem <ref>, let us proceed to the following changes of coordinates\n\t\n    \u03a8\u0303\u27f6   ,\n      \u03a8\u0303'\u27f6  .\n\n\tUsing the relationship between the \u03b5\u0302^-1 and (\u03b5^-1)_\u266d metrics given in (<ref>) as well the fact that \u03b5\u0302 and \u03b5\u0302' have the same expression in their boundary normal coordinates, the Jacobian matrices of \u03a8\u0303^-1 and (\u03a8\u0303')^-1 are given by, respectively,\n\t\n    D\u03a8\u0303^-1=(\n    \t1   0   0\n    \n    \t0   1   0\n    \u03a8\u0303_31   \u03a8\u0303_32   ( |\u011d|/|\u03b5\u0302^-1|)^-1/4),    \n    \tD(\u03a8\u0303')^-1=(\n    \t1   0   0\n    \n    \t0   1   0\n    \u03a8\u0303'_31   \u03a8\u0303'_32   ( |\u011d'|/|\u03b5\u0302^-1|)^-1/4)\n\n\twhere the off diagonal entries are undetermined functions which will be zero at the boundary. Denoting by g_\u03b5 and g_\u03b5' the metrics g and g' in boundary normal coordinates for (\u03b5^-1)_\u266d/(\u03b5'^-1)_\u266d we have\n\t\n    | g_\u03b5|= | D\u03a8\u0303|^-2|\u011d|= \u221a(|\u011d|)\u221a(|\u03b5\u0302^-1|)    | g_\u03b5'|= | D\u03a8\u0303'| ^-2|\u011d'|= \u221a(|\u011d'|)\u221a(|\u03b5\u0302^-1|).\n\n\tMaking use of (<ref>), we deduce\n\t\n    | g_\u03b5|=| D\u03a6|^-1| g_\u03b5'|.\n\n\tAs we showed in Lemma <ref>, the determinant | D\u03a6| can be any positive function which implies that | g_\u03b5|/| g_\u03b5'| can be chosen arbitrarily in a neighbourhood of any point on the boundary and is otherwise equal to one in a neighbourhood of the boundary. By repeating this proof in a neighbourhood of any point on the boundary and combining the results as a composition we can complete the proof for \u03f5^\u266f. Demonstrating an approach symmetric to the above we can prove the corresponding result for the determinant | g | in boundary normal coordinates for \u03bc^\u266f.

We will make use of the principal symbol of L_H which is\n\n    \u03c3_p(L_H) = M_H(\u03be_3)=T_H(x)\u03be_3^2+ A_H(x,\u03be\u0303)\u03be_3+Q_H(x,\u03be\u0303).\n\nM_H is a matrix polynomial with respect to the variable \u03be_3 in the sense of <cit.> and, for fixed (x,\u03be\u0303), the eigenvalues are the solutions of the sixth order polynomial equation det(M_H(\u03be_3)) = 0. \n\n\nSuppose that we have some local boundary coordinates {x^j}_j=1^3 and let \u0393_+(x,\u03be\u0303) \u2282\u2102 be a contour in \u2102 enclosing all eigenvlaues of M_H with positive imaginary part. Then, in the domain of the coordinates, there exist pseudodifferential operators B(x,D_x\u0303) and G_0(x, D_x\u0303) of order 1 and 0, respectively, such that the principal symbol of B is given by\n\n    B^(1)(x,\u03be\u0303)= \u222b_\u0393^+\u03be_3 M_H(\u03be_3)^-1 d\u03be_3(\u222b_\u0393^+  M_H(\u03be_3)^-1 d\u03be_3)^-1\n\nand\n\n    L_H= (\ud835\udd40D_x^3- B^\u2217(x,D_x\u0303)+ G_0 (x,D_x\u0303) )T_H(x)(\ud835\udd40 D_x^3- B(x,D_x\u0303) )\n\nmodulo smoothing. Additionally, B(x,D_x\u0303) satisfies the following Riccati equation\n\n    T_HD_x^3B+ (A_H+ G_H)B+ T_HB^2+ Q_H+ F_H + R_H=0\n\nand the symbol of B is a smooth function of \u03b5\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302.\n\n\n\nThe proof is the same as the proof of <cit.> which we briefly sketch. First, the Riccati equation (<ref>) can be derived from (<ref>) and the expression of the operator L_H as done in the proof of <cit.>. Looking at the principal symbol of the operators on both sides of (<ref>), we see that the principal symbol B^(1) of B must satisfy\n\n    T_H(x)(B^(1)(x,\u03be\u0303))^2+ A_H(x,\u03be\u0303)B^(1)(x,\u03be\u0303)+Q_H(x,\u03be\u0303)=0\n\nand using <cit.> we see that B^(1) given by (<ref>) will satisfy this equation. The remainder of the symbol of B can then be determined by looking at an asymptotic symbol expansion of (<ref>) and this symbol can be asymptotically summed to produce a pseudodifferential operator that satisfies (<ref>) modulo smoothing. Then the symbol for G_0 can be determined from (<ref>) in the same way.\n\nThe final statement about smoothness of the symbol of B with respect to the parameters \u03b5\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302 can be proven by first looking at the principal symbol given by (<ref>). Indeed, given (x,\u03be\u0303) a single choice of \u0393_+ will work also in a neighbourhood of (x,\u03be\u0303), and so the regularity with respect to the parameters follows from the regularity of M_H(\u03be_3)^-1 with respect to the same on the contour \u0393_+. The regularity of the rest of the symbol with respect to \u03b5\u0302 and \u03bc\u0302 follows from this and the construction of the lower order parts of the symbol as given in <cit.>.\n\n\nNext we express the principal symbol B^(1) given by (<ref>) more explicitly. The expression we derive will be used in the calculation of the principal symbols of \u039b_\u03b5\u0302 and \u039b_\u03bc\u0302 later.\nOur method uses the theory of monic matrix polynomials <cit.> to determine the Jordan pairs of M_H(\u03be_3) and then express B^(1)(x,\u03be\u0303) in terms of them. The theory of monic matrix polynomials is applicable to M_H(\u03be_3) as the coefficient T_H(x) is invertible.\n\n\nIn order to calculate the Jordan pairs of M_H, we should find the eigenvalues of M_H and for each eigenvalue \u03be_3 also find covectors y_j such that \n\t\n    \u2211_p=0^j1/p!\u2202_\u03be_3^p M_H(\u03be_3)y_j-p=0,    j=0, \u2026 k-1\n\nwhere k is at most the order of \u03be_3 as a root of the equation (M_H(\u03be_3))=0. For each eigenvalue, the covector y_0 is called a corresponding eigenvector and the covectors y_1,\u2026 y_k-1 are called generalised eigenvectors. Writing M_H(\u03be_3) in coordinates, we have\n\n    (\u221a(|\u03bc\u0302^-1|)/\u221a(|\u03b5\u0302^-1|)(\u03b5\u0302^-1)_lq\u03bc\u0302^qa\u03be_a\u03bc\u0302^kd\u03be_d+ \u03b4_l^k|\u03be|_\u03b5\u0302^2- \u03be_l\u03be_d\u03b5\u0302^dk) H_k=0,\n\nwhere we have made use of the identity (<ref>) for the \u03b5\u0302^-1 metric. Let us now consider the covectors\n\n    \u03be,   \u03b6=\u03b5\u0302^-1\u03bc\u0302\u03be,   \u03c7= \u2217_\u03b5\u0302 (\u03be\u2227\u03b6).\n\nWhen these covectors form a basis (see remark <ref>), we can write M_H in the basis {\u03c7,\u03be,\u03b6} as follows\n\n    [\u03c7   \u03be   \u03b6]^T\u03b5\u0302M_H [\u03c7   \u03be   \u03b6]=(|\u03be|_\u03b5\u0302^2   0   0\n    \n    0   0   \u221a(|\u03bc\u0302^-1|)/\u221a(|\u03b5\u0302^-1|)|\u03be|_\u03bc\u0302^2\n    \n    0    -|\u03be|_\u03bc\u0302^2   \u221a(|\u03bc\u0302^-1|)/\u221a(|\u03b5\u0302^-1|)|\u03be|_\u03bc\u0302\u03b5\u0302^-1\u03bc\u0302^2+|\u03be|_\u03b5\u0302^2).\n\nThe determinant of the above vanishes for \u03be_3 satisfying\n\n    |\u03be|_\u03bc\u0302^4|\u03be|_\u03b5\u0302^2=0.\n\n \nRecalling Remark <ref>, let us point out that the quantities |\u03be|_\u03bc\u0302^2 and |\u03be|_\u03b5\u0302^2 can vanish for complex \u03be as they are given by the real inner products \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9_\u03b5\u0302 \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9_\u03bc\u0302. \n\nFor fixed \u03be\u0303, the solutions \u03be_3 of (<ref>) are conjugate pairs denoted by \u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3, \u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3 and \u03be_\u03b5\u0302_3, \u03be_\u03b5\u0302_3, respectively.

We notice that \u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3 is a double root of (M_H(\u03be_3)) and we expect an eigenvector and a generalised eigenvector associated with this value of \u03be_3.\nThe eigenvector corresponding to \u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3 will be denoted by \u03be_\u03bc\u0302 and is given by\n\n    \u03be_\u03bc\u0302= \u03be|_\u03be_3=\u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3.\n\n The generalised eigenvector is given by\n\t\n    \u03b3_\u03bc\u0302= \u03bd + m_\u03bc\u0302\u03b6_\u03bc\u0302,\n\nwhere\n\n    \u03b6_\u03bc\u0302=\u03b6|_\u03be_3=\u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3         m_\u03bc\u0302=  -  2\u221a(|\u03bc\u0302^-1|)/\u221a(|\u03b5\u0302^-1|)\u27e8\u03bd,\u03be_\u03bc\u0302\u27e9_\u03bc\u0302/\u221a(|\u03bc\u0302^-1|)/\u221a(|\u03b5\u0302^-1|)|\u03be_\u03bc\u0302|_\u03bc\u0302\u03b5\u0302^-1\u03bc\u0302^2+ |\u03be_\u03bc\u0302|_\u03b5\u0302^2.\n\nProceeding to the eigenvalue \u03be_\u03b5\u0302_3, as it is a single root of (M_H(\u03be_3)), it corresponds to the eigenvector\n\u03c7_\u03b5\u0302, defined by\n\n    \u03c7_\u03b5\u0302= \u03c7|_\u03be_3 =\u03be_\u03b5\u0302_3.\n\nTherefore, the Jordan pairs and blocks of the matrix polynomial M_H(\u03be_3) are given by\n\n    Y_\u03b5\u0302= \u03c7_\u03b5\u0302 ,    J_\u03b5\u0302=[\u03be_\u03b5\u0302_3],      \tY_\u03bc\u0302= [\u03be_\u03bc\u0302   \u03b3_\u03bc\u0302],    J_\u03bc\u0302= ( \u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3   1\n    \n    0   \u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3).\n\nUsing the Jordan pairs in the above, the principal symbol of the pseudodifferential operator B(x,D_x\u0303) is expressed as\n\n    B^(1)(x,\u03be\u0303)= X_HJ_HX_H^-1,\n\nwhere\n\n    J_H= (\u03be_\u03b5\u0302_3   0   0\n    \n    0   \u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3   |\u03be_\u03bc\u0302|_\u03b5\u0302\n    \n    0   0   \u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3)    \n    X_H= [\u03c7\u0302_\u03b5\u0302   \u03be\u0302_\u03bc\u0302   \u03b3_\u03bc\u0302]\n\nand \u03c7\u0302_\u03b5\u0302, \u03be\u0302_\u03bc\u0302 denote that the covectors \u03c7_\u03b5\u0302 and \u03be_\u03bc\u0302 are normalised in such a way that X_H \u2208 \u03a8 DO^(0).\nAdditionally, M_H(\u03be_3) can be factorised in terms of B^(1)(x,\u03be\u0303) as \n\n    M_H(\u03be_3)=(\ud835\udd40\u03be_3-(B^\u2217)^(1)(x,\u03be\u0303))T_H(x)(\ud835\udd40\u03be_3 -B^(1)(x,\u03be\u0303)),\n\nwhere in order to derive the above factorisation we use the fact that \tT_H^1/2B^(1)T_H^-1/2, T_H^1/2(B^\u2217)^(1)T_H^-1/2 are spectral right and left divisors of T_H^-1/2M_H(\u03be_3)T_H^-1/2, respectively. Factorising M_H(\u03be_3), we can follow the method of <cit.> to obtain the factorisation of L_H provided in (<ref>), where the principal symbol of B(x,D_x\u0303) is B^(1)(x,\u03be\u0303).\n\n\tWe observe that when \u03be_\u03b5\u0302_3=\u03be_\u03bc\u0302_3, the covectors \u03be, \u03c7 and \u03b6 do not constitute a basis and the representation (<ref>) does not apply.

Then, we use the expressions derived for D_x_3^aH\u0303 and D_x_3^a\u1ebc at x_3=0 to determine the vectors of principal symbols of the Riccati equations (<ref>) and (<ref>), in the sense of Definition <ref>.\n\n\n\tLet (\u03b5\u0302,\u03bc\u0302), (\u03b5\u0302',\u03bc\u0302') be two different sets of electromagnetic parameters and H, H' the associated magnetic fields, respectively and let H\u0303=H'-H. Assume that B, B' are the factorisation operators corresponding to the magnetic fields H, H' and let H\u0303 = H'-H, Y=B'-B. Let us fix boundary normal coordinates for \u03b5\u0302/\u03b5\u0302'.
