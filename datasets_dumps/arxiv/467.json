We usually use the ground set [n]={1,\u2026,n} and write \ud835\udc9c_n:=\ud835\udc9c_[n] for convenience. A conditional independence structure (CI-structure) \ud835\udca2\u2286\ud835\udc9c_E on E is a subset of \ud835\udc9c_E. \n\t\n\t\tNotational convention: In this paper we use the \u201cMat\u00fa\u0161 notation\". Subsets (possibly empty) are denoted by upper case letters, singletons are denoted by lower case letters, concatenation of letters means disjoint union of sets. In particular, i and j are exchangeable in the notation (ij|K) of a CI-statement. If the CI-structure \ud835\udca2 is clear in the context, we write i j|K iff (ij|K)\u2208\ud835\udca2 and i j|K iff (ij|K)\u2209\ud835\udca2. If a condition is appeared as an axiom, it should be valid for all subsets and singletons of the ground set such that the expression makes sense, for example, subsets are assumed to be disjoint whenever they are written in concatenation.\n\t\n\tLet \u03be=(\u03be_1,\u2026,\u03be_n) be an n-dimensional random vector, and we denote \u201crandom variables \u03be_i and \u03be_j are conditionally independent given {\u03be_l:l\u2208 K}\" by i j|K. Then the CI-structure [[\u03be]]:={(ij|K)\u2208\ud835\udc9c_n: i j|K} satisfies the semigraphoid axiom <cit.>\n\t\n\t\t\n  (SG) i j|K \u2227 i\u2113 |jK \u21d2 i\u2113 |K \u2227 i j|\u2113 K.\n\t\n\tA CI-structure is a semigraphoid if it satisfies the axiom (SG). As in the case of matroids and linear independence, there exist semigraphoids which does not come from the conditional independence among any random vector. The CI-structures coming from random vectors are not finitely axiomatizable <cit.>, however they are approximated by semigraphoids <cit.>.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tIn <cit.> a geometric characterization of semigraphoids is given and is referred to as convex rank tests.  A CI-statement (ij|K)\u2208\ud835\udc9c_n is associated to the set of walls\n\t\n    {\ud835\udc31\u2208\u211d^n:x_k_1\u2265\u22ef\u2265  x_k_s\u2265 x_i=x_j\u2265 x_\u2113_1\u2265\u22ef\u2265 x_\u2113_n-s-2}\n\n for k_1\u22ef k_s=K and \u2113_1 \u22ef\u2113_n-s-2=[n]\\ ijK, in the permutohedral fan \u03a3_A_n. Semigraphoids are exactly the subsets \ud835\udca2 of \ud835\udc9c_n such that the removal of all walls corresponding to the elements of \ud835\udca2 from the permutohedral fan \u03a3_A_n results in a coarser fan. If the resulting fan is polytopal, that is, the normal fan of a polytope, then the semigraphoid is structural or a semimatroid, and the polytope is a generalized permutohedron <cit.>. Generalized permutohedra can be characterized in several ways <cit.>. A set function h 2^[n]\u2192\u211d is submodular if h(\u2205)=0 and\n\t\n    h(A)+h(B)\u2265 h(A\u2229 B)+h(A\u222a B)\n\n\tfor any A,B\u2286 [n]. Submodular functions are bijectively corresponding to the generalized permutohedra as their support functions. Therefore a CI-structure \ud835\udca2\u2286\ud835\udc9c_n is a semimatroid iff there is a submodular function h 2^[n]\u2192\u211d such that \n\t\n    \ud835\udca2={ (ij|K)\u2208\ud835\udc9c_n: h(iK)+h(jK)=h(ijK)+h(K) }=:[[h]].\n\n\tSemimatroids encode the combinatorial data of generalized permutohedra: Two generalized permutohedra define the same semimatroid iff their face lattices are same. The lattice of semimatroids ordered by inclusion is isomorphic to the dual of the face lattice of the cone of submodular functions <cit.>.\n\t\n\tSubmodular functions appear and are well investigated in various branches of mathematics. They are important in the modeling of conditional independence as well <cit.>. If \u03be is an n-dimensional discrete random vector, that is, a random vector which takes finite number of values, and h_\u03be 2^[n]\u2192\u211d maps every subset S\u2286 [n] to the Shannon entropy of the subvector \u03be_S, then h is submodular and [[\u03be]]=[[h_\u03be]] <cit.>. The same also holds for the measures with finite multiinformation <cit.>, which contain the class of discrete random vectors and the class of regular normally distributed random vectors. \n\t\n\tA submodular function r 2^[n]\u2192\u2124 is the rank function of a matroid M on [n] if it is integer-valued, subcardinal r(A)\u2264 |A| \u2200 A\u2286 [n] and monotonic r(A)\u2264 r(B) \u2200 A\u2286 B\u2286 [n]. A set S \u2286 [n] is independent in M if r(S)=|S| and otherwise dependent. Minimal dependent sets are circuits and maximal independent sets are bases of M. The basis polytope \ud835\udcab_M\u2286 [0,1]^n of the matroid M is the convex hull of the indicator vectors \ud835\udc1e_B=\u2211_i\u2208 B\ud835\udc1e_i\u2208\u211d^n of all bases B of M. It is the generalized permutohedron whose support function is r. \n\t\n\tOne of the most fascinating facts of matroids is that they can be defined in hundreds of different ways. The axiom systems arise from various areas of mathematics, they are elegant and define different natural looking objects that are indeed equivalent, however the equivalence can be far from obvious. This equivalence of axiomatically defined objects is called the \u201ccryptomorphism\". For instance, rank functions of matroids are cryptomorphic to polytopes whose vertex coordinates are 0 or 1 and edges are parallel to \ud835\udc1e_i-\ud835\udc1e_j, by taking their basis polytopes. Classic axiom systems of matroids and the cryptomorphic among them can be found in the Appendix in <cit.>. Recently, matroids are proven to be cryptomorphic to Stanley-Reisner rings whose symbolic powers are Cohen-Macaulay <cit.> (see <cit.> for more commutative-algebraic axiom systems), tropical varieties of degree 1 <cit.>, supports of multiaffine Lorentzian polynomials <cit.> and simplicial complexes whose combinatorial atlases are hyperbolic <cit.>. In this paper, we show that matroids are cryptomorphic to semigraphoids satisfying a single additional axiom (MCI) and oriented matroids are cryptomorphic to oriented CI-structures satisfying the axioms (OCI1)-(OCI5). We assume that the reader is familiar with the terminologies and basic facts about matroids and oriented matroids, which can be found in <cit.>. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\u00a7 MATROIDS AS CI-STRUCTURES\n\n\t\n\t\n\tA matroid M on [n] with rank function r defines a CI-structure \n\t[[M]]:=[[r]]={ (ij|K)\u2208\ud835\udc9c_n:r(iK)+r(jK)=r(ijK)+r(K) }. In other words, [[M]] is the semimatroid of the submodular function r. \n\t\n\tIf M is loopless, one can recover its rank function from its CI-structure [[M]] recursively by r(\u2205)=0, r(singleton)=1 and\n\t\n    r(ijK)=\n    \t\t\tr(iK)+r(jK)-r(K)     i  j |K\n    \n    \t\t\tr(iK)+r(jK)-r(K)-1     i j|K.\n\nAlternatively, we can recover the independent sets \u2110(M) of the matroid M by \n\n    \u2110(M)={S\u2286 [n]:\ud835\udc9c_S\u2286 [[M]]},\n\n\nwhere \ud835\udc9c_S:={ (ij|K):K\u2286 S,i\u2260 j\u2208 S\\ K }.\n\nReplacing a loop i\u2208 [n] by a coloop and replacing a coloop i by a loop correspond to the translation of matroid polytope by -\ud835\udc1e_i and \ud835\udc1e_i, respectively. They do not affect the normal fan and thus the semimatroid stays unchanged. In this paper we consider loopless matroids as the representatives in every class of matroids on [n] whose base polytopes have the same normal fan.\n\nIn <cit.>, Mat\u00fa\u0161 connected conditional independence to matroid theory by embedding matroids into CI-structures and investigating their probabilistic representability, and introducing the matroid theoretic tools to the research of conditional independence. He stated that a CI-structure can be defined by a matroid iff the sets obtained by (<ref>) are the independent sets of a matroid whose CI-structure is again the original one. Here we characterize these CI-structures by axioms in type of inference rules.\n\t\n\t\tA CI-structure \ud835\udca2\u2286\ud835\udc9c_n is defined by a loopless matroid M iff it satisfies\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  (MCI) i j|K\u21d2 i\u2113 |jKL,\n\t\t\t\n  (SG) i j|K \u2227 i\u2113 |jK \u21d2 i\u2113 |K \u2227 i j|\u2113 K.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tMoreover, the correspondence between matroids and CI-structures satisfying (MCI) and (SG) is one-to-one.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLet M be a matroid on [n] with rank function r. The rank function axioms of matroids imply that i j|K in [[M]] iff \n\t\t\t\n    r(iK)=r(jK)=r(ijK)=r(K)+1.\n\n\t\t\tFrom the second equality and submodularity r(ijK)+r(jKL)\u2265 r(ijKL)+r(jK) and monotonicity r(ijKL)\u2265 r(jkL) of r, we have r(ijKL)=r(jKL). This contradicts i\u2113 |jKL. So is (MCI) proven. The condition (SG) is the semigraphoid axiom. It is always satisfied by semimatroids.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tNow Let \ud835\udca2\u2286\ud835\udc9c_n be a CI-structure satisfying (MCI) and (SG). We need to show that a function r 2^[n]\u2192\u2115 is uniquely defined by the recursion (<ref>) and it is the rank function of a matroid. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTo show the well-definedness of r(S) we apply induction on the cardinality c of S. For c\u2208{0,1} the function value r(S) is given by the initial condition. For c=2, r(ij)=1 if i j| and 2 otherwise. Assume that c\u2265 3 and r(S) is uniquely defined for any S with |S|<c. What is left to check is that we got the same value r(ijkL) for |ijkL|=c by applying (<ref>) to different conditional (in)dependence statements, namely,\n\t\t\t\n    r(ikL)+r(jkL)-r(kL)     i  j |kL\n    \n    \t\t\t\t\tr(ikL)+r(jkL)-r(kL)-1     i j|kL\n    \t\t\t\t\n    \n    \t\t\t=   \n    \t\t\t\tr(ijL)+r(jkL)-r(jL)     i  k |jL\n    \n    \t\t\t\tr(ijL)+r(jkL)-r(jL)-1     i  k |jL.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  * i  j |kL and i  k |jL: From (SG) we have i k|L. By i  k |jL and (MCI) we have i j|L. Therefore\n\t\t\t\n    r(ikL)+r(jkL)-r(kL)   =r(iL)-r(L)-1+r(jkL)\n       =r(ijL)+r(jkL)-r(jL)-1.\n\n\t\tThe case i  k |jL and i  j |kL follows by symmetry.\n\t\t\t\n  * i  j |kL and i  k |jL: By (MCI) we have i j|L and i k|L.\n\t\t\t\n  * i  j |kL and i  k |jL: If i j|L, by (SG) we have i k|L. If i j|L, we have i k|L instead by (SG). In both cases the equality follows.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTo show that r is the rank function of a matroid, what is left to show is r(i_1\u22ef i_s)-r(i_2\u22ef i_s)\u2208{0,1}. Applying (<ref>) s-2 times, we have\n\t\t\t\n    r(i_1\u22ef i_s)-r(i_2\u22ef i_s)=r(i_1)-r(\u2205)-a=1-a,\n\n\t\twhere \n\t\t\n    a=|{ (i_1i_s|i_2\u22ef i_s-1),(i_1i_s-1|i_2\u22ef i_s-2),\u2026, (i_1i_2|) }\\\ud835\udca2|.\n\n\t\tThe condition (MCI) implies that at most one of \n    (i_1i_s|i_2\u22ef i_s-1), (i_1i_s-1|i_2\u22ef i_s-2), \u2026,(i_1i_3|i_2), (i_1i_2|)\n can be a conditional dependent statement, i.e. not in \ud835\udca2, therefore a is either 0 or 1. \t\t \t\n\t\t\n\nWe remark that sometimes it may be more convenient to write the condition (MCI) in the following form \n    i j|K \u2228 i\u2113| jKL   \u2200  i\u2113 jKL\u2286 [n].\n Since semigraphoids satisfying (MCI) are cryptomorphic to loopless matroids, we call such CI-structures matroids as well, and we can read off the CI-structure from other formulations of the matroid. The following lemma will be used repeatedly. \n\t\n\t\tFor any K\u2286 [n] and i\u2260 j\u2208 [n]\\ K, i j|K iff there is a circuit C such that ij\u2286 C\u2286 ijK and every circuit in ijK contains either both i,j or none of them.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLet C be a circuit such that i\u2208 C\u2286 iK. Then r(C)=r(C\\ i). Together with r(iK)=r(K)+1 it contradicts the submodularity\n\t\t\n    r(C)+r(K)\u2265 r(iK)+r(C\\ i).\n\n\t\tIf there is no circuit in ijK containing i,j, then i and j are coloops in ijK. Then r(ijK)=r(iK)+1, so we have i j|K.\n\t\t\n\t\tNow assume that i j|K and there is a circuit ijK' such that K'\u2286 K. We want to show that there exists a circuit containing exactly one of i,j. From i j|K we have \n\t\t\n    r(iK)+r(jK)=r(ijK)+r(K),\n\n\t\tand as ijK' is a circuit, r(ijK')=r(jK'). By submodularity\n\t\t\n    r(jK)+r(ijK')\u2265 r(ijK)+r(jK')\n\n\t\tand monotonicity, we have r(jK)=r(ijK) and therefore r(iK)=r(K). So there is a circuit C' such that i\u2208 C'\u2286 iK.\n\t\n\nWe summarize the following characterizations for the conditional dependence (ij|K)\u2209 [[M]]. They are merely straightforward reformulations of the statements stated previously.\n\n\n\tLet M be a matroid on [n] and [[M]]\u2286\ud835\udc9c_n be the CI-structure associated to M. The following are equivalent for any K\u2286 [n] and i\u2260 j\u2208[n]\\ K:\n\t\n\t\t\n  * i j|K.\n\t\t\n  * r(iK)=r(jK)=r(ijK)=r(K)+1.\n\t\t\n  * There exists a circuit C of M such that ij\u2286 C\u2286 ijK and every circuit in ijK contains either both i,j or none of them. \n\t\t\n  * The set ij is a cocircuit (or equivalently, K is a hyperplane) in the restriction of M to ijK.\n\t\t\n  * For any basis B of K, iB and jB are bases of ijK.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n  * There exists a basis B of K such that iB and jB are bases of ijK.\n\t\t\n  * Any wall of \u03a3_A_n corresponding to (ij|K) by (<ref>) is in some wall of the normal fan \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udcab_M) of the base polytope \ud835\udcab_M of M.\n\t\n\n\nIn <cit.>, the notions of matroid operations are adapted to conditional independence. Let \ud835\udca2\u2286\ud835\udc9c_n be a CI-structure. The deletion and contraction of \ud835\udca2 by A\u2286 [n] are\n\n    \ud835\udca2\\ A:= { (ij|K)\u2208\ud835\udca2: ijK\u2286 [n]\\ A },\n       \ud835\udca2/ A:= { (ij|K)\u2208\ud835\udc9c_[n]\\ A: (ij|KA)\u2208\ud835\udca2},\n\nrespectively. They reflect the marginalization and conditioning in probability theory. The dual of \ud835\udca2 is \ud835\udca2^\u2217:={ (ij|[n]\\ ijK):(ij|K)\u2208\ud835\udca2}. The usual rules for matroid operations also work for CI-structure operations, e.g. deletion and contraction commute and are dual operations of each other. A CI-structure \ud835\udca2' is a minor of a CI-structure \ud835\udca2 if \ud835\udca2' can be obtained from \ud835\udca2 by applying any sequence of restriction and contraction. The direct sum of two CI-structures \ud835\udca2_1\u2286\ud835\udc9c_E_1 and \ud835\udca2_2\u2286\ud835\udc9c_E_2 is the CI-structure\n\n    \ud835\udca2_1\u2295\ud835\udca2_2={ (ij|K)\u2208\ud835\udc9c_E_1E_2: i\u2208 E_1,j\u2208 E_2     or  ij\u2286 E_1,(ij|K\u2229 E_1)\u2208\ud835\udca2_1\n        or  ij\u2286 E_2,(ij|K\u2229 E_2)\u2208\ud835\udca2_2}\n\non E_1E_2.\n\nThe operations on CI-structures are compatible with the operations on matroids, namely, [[M\\ A]]=[[M]]\\ A, [[M/ A]]=[[M]]/ A and [[M^\u2217]]=[[M]]^\u2217 for any matroid M on [n] and any A\u2286 [n], and [[M_1\u2295 M_2]]=[[M_1]]\u2295 [[M_2]] for any matroids M_1,M_2 on disjoint ground sets <cit.>. In particular, being a matroid is a minor-closed property of CI-structures. In <cit.>, classes of CI-structures are investigated via forbidden minors. The CI-structures that are matroids, although having a short axiomatization by (MCI) and (SG), cannot be characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors.\n\n\n\tThe class of CI-structures that are matroids cannot be characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors. \n\n\n\tLet \ud835\udca2_m:=\ud835\udc9c_m\\{ (12|),(ij|K):ijK=[m] } for m\u2265 4. In other words, \ud835\udca2_m is the semimatroid defined by the sum of rank functions of matroids U_1,2\u2295 U_m-2,m-2 and U_m-1,m, where U_r,m is the rank-r uniform matroid on [m]. Then \ud835\udca2_m is not a matroid because (MCI) is violated by (12|),(13|245\u22ef m)\u2209\ud835\udca2_m. However, any proper minor of \ud835\udca2_m is a matroid as \ud835\udca2_m\\ 1\u2245\ud835\udca2_m\\ 2\u2245  [[U_m-1]], \ud835\udca2_m\\ i\u2245 [[U_1,2\u2295 U_m-3,m-3]] for any i\u2208 [m]\\1,2 and \ud835\udca2/j\u2245 [[U_m-2,m-1]] for any j\u2208[m].\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\u00a7 ORIENTED MATROIDS AS ORIENTED CI-STRUCTURES\n\n\t\tAn oriented CI-structure on [n] is a map \u03c3\ud835\udc9c_ n\u2192{ -1,0,1 }. In <cit.>, oriented gaussoids are introduced for modeling the signs of the partial correlations among regular normally distributed random vectors. General oriented CI-structures are introduced in <cit.>.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t For notions regarding oriented matroids we use the notations in <cit.>. A signed subset of [n] is a map X [n]\u2192{-1,0,1}. Write X^+:=X^-1(1), X^-:=X^-1(-1) and X:=X^+X^-. A collection \ud835\udc9e of signed subsets of [n] is the set of signed circuits of an oriented matroid on [n] if it satisfies\n\t\n\t\t\n  (OC0) \u2205\u2209\ud835\udc9e,\n\t\t\n  (OC1) \ud835\udc9e=-\ud835\udc9e,\n\t\t\n  (OC2) for all X,Y\u2208\ud835\udc9e with X\u2286Y, either X=Y or X=-Y,\n\t\t\n  (OC3) for all X,Y\u2208\ud835\udc9e, X\u2260 -Y and e\u2208 X^+\u2229 Y^- there is a Z\u2208\ud835\udc9e such that Z^+\u2286 (X^+\u222a Y^+)\\ e and Z^-\u2286 (X^-\u222a Y^-)\\ e.\n\t\n\tIf (OC0), (OC1) and (OC2) are satisfied, then (OC3) is equivalent to the following condition known as the strong elimination axiom:\n\t\n\t\t\n  (OC3') For all X,Y\u2208\ud835\udc9e, e\u2208 X^+\u2229 Y^- and f\u2208 (X^+\\ Y^-)\u222a (X^-\\ Y^+), there is a Z\u2208\ud835\udc9e such that Z^+\u2286 (X^+\u222a Y^+)\\ e, Z^-\u2286 (X^-\u222a Y^-)\\ e and f\u2208 Z.\n\t\n\tIf \ud835\udc9e is a circuit signature of a matroid M, that is, \ud835\udc9e consists of two opposite signed sets X and -X supported by C for each circuit C of M, then \ud835\udc9e clearly satisfies (OC0)-(OC2). In this case, we only need to check the X,Y in (OC3) such that X and Y are a modular pair in M, that is, r(X)+r(Y)=r(X\u222a Y)+r(X\u2229 Y).

By the following Proposition, \u03c3_\u2133 can be obtained directly from the chirotope of \u2133.\n\n\tLet \u03c7[n]r\u2192{-1,0,1} be the chirotope of an oriented matroid \u2133 on [n]. The oriented CI-structure \u03c3_\u2133\ud835\udc9c_n\u2192{-1,0,1} associated to \u2133 can be obtained from the chirotope \u03c7 by\n\t\n    \u03c3_\u2133(ij|K)=-\u03c7(i,b_1,\u2026,b_s,a_1,\u2026,a_r-s-1)\u03c7(j,b_1,\u2026,b_s,a_1,\u2026,a_r-s-1),\n\n\twhere b_1\u22ef b_s is a basis of K and a_1\u22ef a_r-s-1 is a subset of [n]\\ ijK such that \u03c7(i,b_1,\u2026,b_s,a_1,\u2026,a_r-s-1)\u2260 0 whenever it exists, and \u03c3_\u03c7(ij|K)=0 if no such a_1\u22ef a_r-s-1 exists.\n\n\n\tLet \u03c3_\u03c7(ij|K) be the oriented CI-structure defined in the Proposition. It is easy to see that \u03c3_\u03c7(ij|K)=0 iff there is a basis b_1\u22ef b_s of K such that iK or jK is not a basis of ijK in \u2133. By Proposition\u00a0<ref>, this is equivalent to (ij|K)\u2208[[\u2133]]. Now assume that (ij|K)\u2209 [[\u2133]]. Let C be the circuit in \u2133 such that ij\u2286 C\u2286 ijb_1\u22ef b_s, then \u03c3_\u03c7(ij|K)=\u03c3_\u03c7(ij|C\\ ij) coincides with the sign \u03c3(i,j) defined in <cit.>, which gives back the original oriented matroid \u2133 by <cit.>, therefore we have \u03c3_\u03c7=\u03c3_\u2133. The well-definedness of \u03c3_\u03c7 follows as well.\n\n\t\n\n\u00a7 REMARKS ON REPRESENTATIONS OF MATROIDS\n\n\tIn <cit.>, Mat\u00fa\u0161 introduced representations of matroids in probability theory and information theory which lead to new insight into representability of matroids. A matroid M is probabilistically representable if its CI-structure coincides with the conditional independence among a discrete random vector \u03be, that is, [[M]]=[[\u03be]]=[[h_\u03be]]. As the rank function of any connected matroid spans an extreme ray in the cone of submodular functions, the probabilistic representability is equivalent to the entropicness in the case of connected matroids, where a matroid is entropic if its rank function is a positive multiple of the entropy function of some discrete random vector. Linear and multilinear matroids are entropic <cit.>, however the direct sum of Fano matroid and non-Fano matroid is algebraic but not entropic <cit.>. The rank function of any algebraic matroids is the pointwise limit of a sequence of entropy functions <cit.>, such matroids are called almost entropic <cit.>. The dual of an almost entropic matroid is not necessarily almost entropic <cit.>, while a long standing open problem in matroid theory is whether the dual of any algebraic matroid is algebraic. \n\t\n\tA Gaussian conditional independence, however, can never represent an interesting matroid. A semigraphoid \ud835\udca2\u2286\ud835\udc9c_n is a gaussoid if it satisfies the following axioms:\n\t\n\t\t\t\n  (Int) {(ij|kL),(ik|jL)}\u2286\ud835\udca2\u21d2{(ij|L),(ik|L)}\u2286\ud835\udca2,\n\t\n  (Comp) {(ij|L),(ik|L)}\u2286\ud835\udca2\u21d2{(ij|kL),(ik|jL)}\u2286\ud835\udca2,\n\n  (WT) {(ij|L),(ij|kL)}\u2286\ud835\udca2\u21d2 (ik|L)  or  (jk|L)\u2208\ud835\udca2.\n\t\nGaussoids are introduced in <cit.> as an abstraction of the conditional independence among regular normally distributed random variables: If \u03be is an n-dimensional regular normally distributed random vector whose covariance matrix is \u03a3, then [[\u03be]]={(ij|K)\u2208\ud835\udc9c_n:\u03a3_iK,jK=0}=:[[\u03a3]] is a gaussoid. The CI-structures coming from regular normally distributed random vectors are not finitely axiomatizable <cit.>, they are axiomatically approximated by gaussoids <cit.>. In <cit.> it was computationally verified that for 3\u2264 n\u2264 8 no CI-structure corresponding to a connected matroid on [n] is a gaussoid. We confirm this computation by showing that a loopless matroid is a gaussoid iff it is a direct sum of copies of uniform matroids U_1,1 and U_1,2.\n\n\t\n\t\tLet M be a loopless matroid. Then [[M]] is a gaussoid iff M\u2245 U_1,1^\u2295 m_1\u2295 U_1,2^\u2295 m_2.\n\t\n\n\tThe necessity follows from the observation that [[U_1,1]]=[[(1)]] and [[U_1,2]]=[[(\n\t\t1     0.1\n\n\t\t0.1     1\n\t)]] are gaussoids and [[\u03a3_1]]\u2295[[\u03a3_2]]=[[\u03a3_1\u2295\u03a3_2]] for any positive definite matrices \u03a3_1,\u03a3_2 <cit.>.\n\t\n\tNow assume that M is a loopless matroid on the ground set E such that [[M]] is a gaussoid. We deduce the following three inference rules for any ij\u2113 K\u2286 E from (MCI), (SG), (Int) and (Comp):\n\nClaim 1. i j|K \u21d2 i j|\u2113 K. It follows by (MCI) from i j|K that i\u2113|jK and j\u2113|iK. And by (Int) we get i\u2113|K. However by (SG) we have i\u2113|K or i j|\u2113 K from i j|K. Thus we have i j|\u2113 K.\n\nClaim 2. i j|\u2113 K \u21d2 i j| K. It follows by (MCI) from i j|\u2113 K that i\u2113|K and j\u2113|K. And by (Comp) we get i\u2113|jK. However by (SG) we have i\u2113|jK or i j|K from i j|\u2113 K. Thus we have i j|K.\n\nClaim 3. i j| \u21d2 i\u2113 |. By applying (MCI) we get i\u2113 |j and j\u2113 |j from i j|. Then i\u2113| follows from (Int).\n\nBy Claim\u00a03, the ground set E can be partitioned into 2-element sets {a_\u03b9,b_\u03b9}, \u03b9\u2208[m_2] and singletons {c_\u03b9}, \u03b9\u2208[m_1] such that a_\u03b9 b_\u03b9| for any \u03b9\u2208 [m_2] and i j| if i,j\u2208 E are in different blocks. By Claim\u00a01 and Claim\u00a02, for any two subsets K,K'\u2286 E\\ ij we have i j|K iff i j|K'. Therefore, the loopless matroid M is isomorphic to the direct sum of m_2 rank one uniform matroids on {a_\u03b9,b_\u03b9}, \u03b9\u2208[m_2] and m_1 rank one uniform matroids on {c_\u03b9}, \u03b9\u2208[m_1].\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author would like to thank Thomas Kahle for his comments.
