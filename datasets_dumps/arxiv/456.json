No significant deviations from the SM predictions were found, as a result of which it is considered as a mathematically consistent effective field theory for a very large energy scale. At the same time, it is obvious that SM is not a complete theory, since it cannot explain a number of observed phenomena not only in particle physics, but also in astrophysics and cosmology. One of the most well-known problems of SM is the problem of neutrino masses and neutrino oscillations <cit.>, which will be considered in this paper. The essense of the problem is the absence of clarity concerning what mechanism provides the observed neutrino mass spectrum and how neutrinos of one flavor disappear and turn into neutrinos of another flavor. Some still-unknown particles would be needed to analyse the neutrino puzzle. Let us mention that the solution of other equally well-known problems of SM, which are the problem of dark matter and dark energy in the Universe, as well as the problem of its baryon asymmetry (BAU) generation, like the neutrino problem, can also be associated with the SM extension by new particles and/or interactions. The inability of modern collider experiments to detect new particles may be due not only to their large masses, but also to extremely elusive interactions with SM particles, making their production extremely rare events. In other words, to detect feebly interacting particles, the requirements for the integrated luminosity of the beam(s) in the experiment must cross the 'intensity frontier'. \n\nA well-known example of a field-theoretic model, within the framework of which it is possible to solve a significant part of the above-mentioned problems by extending the set of SM particles with relatively light and weakly interacting new particles of the lepton sector, is the \u03bdMSM model (neutrino minimal standard model) <cit.>. It is an extension of the SM with the help of three Majorana neutrinos whose flavor states do not participate in gauge interactions (so-called sterile neutrinos, also called heavy neutral leptons, HNL). The masses of sterile neutrinos do not exceed the electroweak scale O (10^2) GeV and at the same time significantly exceed the value of the mass parameter Fv (F is the neutrino Yukawa coupling constant and v is the Higgs field vacuum expectation value equal to 174\u00a0GeV), as a result of which the mass generation mechanism (known as the seesaw type-I  see Section\u00a0<ref> below) works well for neutrino. Within the framework of the \u03bdMSM, it is not necessary to introduce a new mass scale for heavy fermions, the Majorana masses are comparable to the masses of light quarks and charged leptons. The number of sterile neutrinos should be at least three. At least two states of sterile neutrinos are necessary to explain the known experimental parameters \u0394 m^2_atm and \u0394 m^2_sol. However, none of these states are suitable for the role of a dark matter particle, since (1) their Yukawa constants are not sufficiently limited to form a moderate amount of dark matter within the framework of the Dodelson\u2013Widrow mechanism <cit.>, and (2) the one-loop radiative decays of such states in the subdominant channel  \nN_2,3\u2192\u03bd\u03b3 with the energy E_\u03b3 = 1/2 M_2,3 <cit.> would produce too many gamma rays compared to the available astrophysical experimental data[\nNote that the unidentified spectral line at the energy E \u223c 3.5 keV in the stacked X-ray spectra of dark-matter-dominated objects has been observed <cit.>. The signal distribution over the sky and the ratios of its strengths are consistent with predictions for decaying dark matter with the mass M_1 \u2243 7.1 \u00b1 0.1 keV <cit.>.].\nFor these reasons, one more sterile neutrino (the HNL of the first generation[\nThroughout the paper we will assume that there is a normal ordering in the HNL sector, i.e., M_1 < M_2 \u2264 M_3.]\nadded to the \u03bdMSM provides a suitable candidate for the role of dark matter. \n\n Adding three HNLs introduces 18\u00a0new parameters, 3 Majorana masses and 15 parameters of the Yukawa coupling matrix F.\n\nThe mass of a DM sterile neutrino can be varied in the range \n\n\u223c1\u201350 keV in the case of \u03bdMSM <cit.>. The baryogenesis of the \u03bdMSM is provided by the oscillation mechanism\u00a0<cit.>. In the following, three generations of HNL are considered, which makes it possible to explain simultaneously the origin of the masses of standard (or active) neutrinos due to the seesaw mechanism, the existence of a dark-matter particle and the generation of baryon asymmetry. \nSignificant limitations on the mixing parameter value for HNL in the \u03bdMSM model, as well as on the second- and third-generation HNL masses, which should be split very weakly <cit.>, are reviewed in <cit.>.\n\nIn extensions of the SM lepton sector, the active neutrino flavor states and mass\nstates can be related with the help of Pontecorvo\u2013Maki\u2013Nakagawa\u2013Sakata mixing matrix \nU_ PMNS,\n\u03bd_l L(x) = \u2211_i (U_ PMNS)_li_i L(x),\nwhere \u03bd_l L is the left-handed (LH) component of the flavour\nfield, _i L is the LH component of the state possessing a mass m_i,  i=1,2,3, and l=e, \u03bc, \u03c4\u00a0<cit.>. \n\nThe exact values of neutrino masses are unknown, but it follows\nfrom the \nexisting data \nthat there are at least three active neutrino mass eigenstates, \n\nneutrinos must be light, \n\n|(m_\u03bd)_ll'| \u2264 1 eV (l,l'=e, \u03bc, \u03c4),\n<cit.> and the neutrino mass values are rather strongly split.\nThe differences between them measured experimentally give the central values of mass parameters squared\n\u0394 m_sol^2 \u2248 7.54 \u00d7  10^-5 eV^2 and  \n\u0394 m_atm^2 \u2248 2.43 \u00d7  10^-3 eV^2  <cit.>. This leaves two different possibilities of neutrino mass ordering: normal ordering (NO) m_1 < m_2 \u226a m_3 or inverse ordering (IO)  m_3 \u226a m_1 < m_2. \nThe mass of the lightest\nneutrino m_0 may vary from zero to \n0.03 eV (NO) or 0.015 eV (IO) allowed by cosmological observations <cit.> (see also <cit.>). Within the \u03bdMSM,  the lightest active neutrino is lighter than O (10^-5) eV <cit.>. The HNL masses responsible for active neutrino mass generation\nare rather strongly constrained both by direct searches \n\n<cit.>\n\nand cosmological considerations <cit.>.\nThe analysis of lepton universality within the \u03bdMSM shows that\nM_2,3 > 173 MeV (264 MeV) for NO (IO)\u00a0<cit.>, see also <cit.>. \nThe recent investigation of BAU <cit.> implies the masses of HNL to be M_2,3\u2265 O(3) GeV.\n\nHistorically, the motivation for considering right-handed (RH)\nneutrinos have appeared from the left-right symmetric extension of the SM <cit.>\nwhere the electroweak group of symmetry SU(2)_L \u00d7 U(1)_Y was \nextended to the SU(2)_L \u00d7 SU (2)_R \u00d7 U(1)_B-L.\nThe observed left chirality of the low-energy weak interactions in the model with left\u2013right symmetry, usually attributed to the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry, implies the existence of a right-handed neutrino.\n\nIt is commonly assumed that the effective mass (m_\u03bd)_ll' can be presented as\n\n    (m_\u03bd)_ll' = - M_D M_M^-1 M_D^T\n\nin the limit M_D \u226a M_M, where M_D, M_M are Dirac and Majorana mass matrices of the LH and RH neutrinos (see details below).\nHowever, Eq. (<ref>) is a standard approximation of a more complicated expression including an additional 3 \u00d7 3 matrix \u03b8 (|\u03b8| \u226a I) describing mixing of the active neutrinos with HNL. The contribution of the next-order terms in effective neutrino mass representations requires a separate study.  \nIn the following, Section <ref>, we investigate the standard approach for the\ntype-I seesaw mechanism and consider the non-minimal approximations for effective masses of the active and sterile neutrinos. Nonstandard parametrization of the mixing inspired by diagonalization of the active-sterile neutrino mass matrix in the approach of <cit.> and a nontrivial relation for the parametrization matrix \u03a9_ nm have been obtained. The numerical analysis within the \u03bdMSM framework is performed in Section <ref>. Results are discussed in Section <ref>. \nA symmetric structure of effective and Majorana mass matrices as well as relations for M_D \u03b8^T and \u03b8^\u2020 M_D are analyzed in Appendix <ref>.\nSimple representations for the matrix \u03a9_ nm are considered in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\nA form of effective mass matrix of active neutrinos m_\u03bd as function of U_ PMNS in standard and non-minimal approximations is derived in Appendix <ref>.\n\n \n\n\n\u00a7 A MODEL WITH THREE RIGHT-HANDED NEUTRINOS\n\n\n\nThe lagrangian of the SM extension by three right-handed neutrinos \u03bd_R has the form (see e.g.,  <cit.>)\n\n    L =  L_SM + i \u03bd_R \u2202_\u03bc\u03b3^\u03bc\u03bd_R- ( F l_L \u03bd_R H\u0303 + M_M/2\u03bd^c_R \u03bd_R + h.c.),\n\nwhere \nl_L=(\u03bd_L    e_L)^T\nis the left-handed lepton doublet,\n\u03bd_R is the right-handed neutrino \n[(\u03bd_R)^c \u2261 C \u03bd_R^T, where C=i \u03b3_2 \u03b3_0 is the charge conjugation matrix], \nH is the Higgs doublet (H\u0303= \u03f5_ij H^\u2020, \u03f5_ij antisymmetric tensor), \nF is the neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix, and\nM_M is the 3 \u00d7 3 Majorana mass matrix of the RH neutrinos,\nwhich does not break the SM gauge symmetry.\n\nAfter spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking, the full neutrino mass term in Equation\u00a0(<ref>) can be presented as  \n\n    1/2 (\u03bd_L \n    \u03bd^c_R)  M(\n    \u03bd_L^c\n    \u03bd_R),     where     M=\n    (\n    \n     0    M_D\n    M_D^T   M_M),\n\nM_D= F v is a 3 \u00d7 3 neutrino Dirac mass matrix (v=174 GeV is a vacuum expectation value of the Higgs doublet), and M_D, M_M are complex-valued in the general case.  \nIn the neutrino mass basis with the help of a unitary matrix U\n\n    U= W \u00b7 diag(U_\u03bd,U_N^*),\n\n(U_\u03bd,U_N on the one hand side and W on the other hand side are 3\u00d7 3 and 6\u00d7 6 matrices, respectively), one can define the diagonal mass matrix <cit.>\n\n    U^\u2020 M U^*\n    =\n    (\n    m\u0302    0 \n    \n     0    M\u0302),\n        m\u0302 =  diag(m_1, m_2, m_3),\n    M\u0302 =  diag(M_1, M_2, M_3),\n\nwhere m_i, M_i are masses of light and heavy neutrinos.\n\nThe unitary diagonalization matrix W formally expressed as the exponential of an antihermitian matrix, see <cit.>,\n\n    W = exp(\n    \n    0    \u03b8\n    -\u03b8^\u2020    0\n    )\n\n(where \u03b8 is a 3 \u00d7 3 complex matrix)\nconverts the matrix M to a block diagonal form\n\n    W^\u2020(\n    \n     0    M_D\n    M_D^T   M_M) W^* \n    =\n    (\n    m_\u03bd    0\n    \n    0    M_N) \u2261M\u0303.\n\nHere, m_\u03bd, M_N are effective Majorana mass terms for the LH and RH flavour neutrinos (see, e.g., <cit.>) which are related with m\u0302 and M\u0302 by \n\n    m_\u03bd = U_\u03bdm\u0302 U_\u03bd^T,     \n    M_N = U_N^* M\u0302 U_N^\u2020.\n\n\n\n\nThe flavour states \u03bd_L and \u03bd_R and the mass states  and N then can be related as <cit.>\n\n    (\n    \u03bd_L\n    \u03bd_R^c)\n    =\n    P_L  U(\n    \n    N),\n\nwhere \nP_L is a left-helicity projector.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Standard approximation\n \n\nAssuming that \u03b8 is \u201csmall,\u201d it is sufficient to expand the rotation matrix (<ref>) up to O(\u03b8^2)\u00a0terms\n\n    W = exp(\n    \n    0    \u03b8\n    -\u03b8^\u2020    0\n    )\n    \u2243(\n    1-1/2\u03b8\u03b8^\u2020   \u03b8\n    -\u03b8^\u2020   1-1/2\u03b8^\u2020\u03b8),\n\nthus, using (<ref>) and the requirement M\u0303_12=0, one can relate Dirac, Majorana and \u03b8 matrices \n\n    \u03b8\u2243 M_D M_M^-1,\n\nwhich yields the expressions\n\n    m_\u03bd   \u2243    -

Experimental information is reduced to exclusion contours generated on the mass-mixing plane for different detectors. It should be noted that these exclusion contours use a model-independent phenomenological approach, in which only one HNL gives the observed signal, and the remaining two are strongly decoupled and practically do not affect the analysis. Within the framework of this approach, only two independent parameters are considered, the HNL mass and its coupling constant with an active neutrino, the generation of exclusion contours is carried out for the square of the mixing parameter as a function of mass for one flavor only, while the mixing for other flavors is assumed to be zero. Assumptions of this kind seem to be very strong and need to be translated for the case of a specific model. Suffice it to note that, even in the simple case of one generation of Majorana neutrinos <cit.>, the mixing parameter U=M_D/M_N depends on the mass of HNL, as a result of which the mapping of the active neutrino mass\u2014HNL mass plane to the mixing squared\u2014HNL mass plane is a triangle, not a rectangle. A part of the triangle for a limited region of HNL masses may look approximately like a rectangle  due to the low mass of the active neutrino.\n\nIn the following instructive example, we will vary the masses of the lightest neutrino and heavy neutrinos in  \n\nthe  ranges (see <cit.>)\n\n    m_0:        0 - 10^-5 eV,\n    \n    M_i:        1 - 50  keV for  M_1,      1-100  GeV for  M_2,3,\n\nparametrize the masses of active neutrinos as \nm_1^2 = m_0^2,\nm_2^2 = m_0^2+ \u0394 m_sol^2,\nm_3^2 = m_0^2+ \u0394 m_sol^2+  \u0394 m_atm^2\nfor NO or \n\nm_1^2 = m_0^2+ \u0394 m_sol^2,\nm_2^2 = m_0^2+ \u0394 m_sol^2+  \u0394 m_atm^2,\nm_3^2 = m_0^2\nfor IO \nand use the present central values of the known active neutrino sector parameters <cit.>.\n\nIn addition, we will use phenomenologically convenient quantities (see, e.g., <cit.>)\n\n    U_\u03b1 I^2= |\u0398_\u03b1 I|^2,     \n     U_I^2=\u2211_\u03b1 U_\u03b1 I^2,     \n      U^2=\u2211_I U_I^2.\n\n\nAmong the infinite set of \u03a9_ m matrices satisfying the  requirement \u03a9_ m^T \u03a9_ m=I, \nwe consider \nthe following explicit forms \n\n\n    \u03a9^'   =    I,     \u03a9^\u201d=\n    - (\n    1/\u221a(2)   -1/2   -1/2\n    1/3 \u221a(2)   5/6   -1/2\n    2/3   1/3 \u221a(2)   1/\u221a(2)), \n    \u03a9^\u201d'_ NO   =   (\n    \n    1     0     0\n    \n    0     0     1 \n    \n    0    -1    0\n    ),\n     \u03a9^\u201d'_ IO=\n    (\n    \n    0     0     1\n    \n    0    -1    0 \n    \n    1     0     0\n    ),\n\nwhere \u03a9_ m=\u03a9^' corresponds to a naive explicit form used, e.g., in <cit.>;\nthe form \n\u03a9_ m=\u03a9^\u201d is not motivated by any special physical scenarios and used for numerical estimations in this section only; and\n\u03a9_ m=\u03a9^\u201d' is a form inspired by a parametrization in <cit.> with fixed parameters \u03c9=\u03c0/2, \u03be=1\nwhich (as was determined numerically) \n\nmaximize the CP-asymmetry.\n\nThe non-minimal parametrization matrix satisfying (<ref>) is chosen as (see, also, Appendix <ref>)\n\n    \u03a9_ nm =  diag (\u03c9_1, \u03c9_2, \u03c9_3),  where \u03c9_i = \u221a(1-1/3m_i/M_i).\n\n\nResults of evaluations for diagonal elements (m_\u03bd)_ee,  (m_\u03bd)_\u03bc\u03bc,  (m_\u03bd)_\u03c4\u03c4 with explicit forms \u03a9_ m as \u03a9^', \u03a9^\u201d, \u03a9^\u201d' are presented in \nTable\u00a0<ref>, where \nfirst M_D is found using (<ref>) then (m_\u03bd)_ll is evaluated with the help of (<ref>) and (<ref>).\nThe results for all cases coincide [in accordance with (<ref>)]\nand are below the present experimental bounds.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe dependence of U^2 as a function of masses of heavy neutrinos M_1 and M_2=M_3=M at m_0=10^-5 eV \nfor NO is presented in Figure\u00a0<ref>a, where one can see that its values are O(10^-9) and practically constant for all  M. \nThe qualitative behavior is similar for other cases. \nAs a rule, the contributions of M_1 to U^2 are neglected (as was assumed e.g., in <cit.>);\nhowever, Figure\u00a0<ref>a demonstrates that the dependence U^2(M_1) can be sizable in some cases. \nOne can note that the minimal (maximal) value of U^2 is achieved at benchmark point BP_ min (BP_ max), where\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBP_ min:    m_0=0, M_1=50 keV, M=100 GeV,\n\nBP_ max:    m_0=10^-5 eV, M_1=1 keV, M=1 GeV.\n\n \n\n \n\nNumerical estimations of U^2 for different \u03a9_ m (\u03a9^', \u03a9^\u201d, \u03a9^\u201d') can be found in Table\u00a0<ref>; based on these numbers, it is possible to come to a conclusion about the great complexity of heavy Majorana neutrinos observation. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe relative difference |U^2_ nm-U^2_ m|/U^2_ nm for NO, IO and different \u03a9_ m (\u03a9^', \u03a9^\u201d, \u03a9^\u201d') at  BP_ min (BP_ max) is presented in Table\u00a0<ref>. One can see that it is quite small for \u03a9^', \u03a9^\u201d'_ NO and is very large for \u03a9^\u201d_ NO, which is a consequence of different representations for \u03a9_ m and \u03a9_ nm. Thus, the most relevant comparison can be performed for \u03a9_ m=\u03a9^' and \u03a9_ nm defined by (<ref>) and (<ref>) since for such representations of the parametrization matrix, it is possible to trace the limit from the standard approximation to the non-minimal one.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relative difference of U^2 obtained in the minimal and non-minimal approximations as a function of M_2=M_3=M for \u03a9^\u201d' in the NO case is presented in Figure\u00a0<ref>b. \n As one can see, the results for BP1 and BP3 coincide which is explained by the choice m_0=0 and the explicit form of \u03a9^\u201d'.\nThe behavior of the relative difference of U^2 at m_0=0 and m_0 \u2260 0 is different due to the contributions of M_1 to the mixing parameter.  Thus, the approximation with two RH neutrinos is quite reliable at m_0=0 and \u03a9^\u201d', while one should use a model with three  HNL at m_0 \u2260 0. \nThe relative difference for NO is rather small.\nThus, in the cases where the limit of discussed approximations can be traced, the phenomenological consequences with a mixing parameter obtained in\nthe non-minimal approximation can be hardly distinguished from the results of a standard approach (see examples in <cit.>) at present or future facilities.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS\n\n\n\nThe paper is devoted to the investigation of the SM extension by the three generations of sterile Majorana neutrinos which recover the left\u2013right symmetry between quarks and leptons. \nExperimental detection of particles of this kind would greatly affect our understanding of particle physics and cosmology. The analysis carried out is especially significant for models in which there is no additional nonstandard scale of particle masses, so that a well-known 'model-independent approach' to calculating constraints for the model parameter space may not be directly relevant to reality. \nA non-minimal approximation for effective masses of light and heavy neutrinos in the framework of a type-I seesaw mechanism with three generations of right-handed Majorana neutrinos was considered. It was found that the obtained next-order corrections to the effective mass matrix of HNL can influence the well-known results of the current order modifying them with O(\u03b8 M_D) corrections. \nAdditional contributions to the effective masses of neutrinos were analysed and the regimes when they can be significant were defined.  \nFollowing the method proposed in\u00a0<cit.>, a parametrization of the mixing matrix was performed with the help of a complex 3 \u00d7 3 matrix \u03a9_ nm satisfying a nontrivial relation (<ref>) in the non-minimal approximation. \nThe structure of effective and Majorana mass matrices was scrutinised and it was demonstrated that they are symmetric matrices, a fact which has not been discussed before. \nUseful relations were found for  M_D \u03b8^T and \u03b8^\u2020 M_D, which allow one to express effective masses in a simple form. \nIt is interesting to note that the modification of the mixing matrix does not change results for the effective mass matrix of active neutrinos m_\u03bd in the non-minimal case. \n\n\n\nThe obtained results were analyzed in detail within the \u03bdMSM framework.\nIt was demonstrated that the approximation with two RH neutrinos is quite reliable at m_0=0, while one should use a model with three  HNL at m_0 \u2260 0.\n New additional corrections to effective masses can be more pronounced when heavy neutrino masses are small and the lightest mass of active neutrino is of O(10^-5) eV.\nNumerical examples demonstrate that the relative difference in the mixing parameter obtained in  standard and non-minimal approximations is negligibly small for all benchmark scenarios of the model where the limit of the discussed approximations can be traced. \nThus, phenomenological consequences for the mixing parameter obtained in the minimal and non-minimal approximations can be hardly distinguished at current and future facilities.\n\nThe question of the explicit form of the parametrization matrix \u03a9 in standard and non-minimal approximations is still ambiguous. Various forms satisfying the requirement |\u03b8| \u226a I and \u03a9_ m\u03a9_ m^T=I were considered with significantly different results. \nEffective masses of HNL in the standard and non-minimal approximations demonstrate noticeable  differences due to new sizeable terms of effective heavy neutrino mass matrix.\nNote that O(\u03b8 M_D) corrections to the splitting of eigenvalues of M_M and M_N matrices can impact both the lepton-number-violating event rates at colliders <cit.> and \nleptogenesis in the early Universe <cit.> (see also <cit.>). \n\n\n\n \n\nThe research was carried out within the framework of the scientific program of the National Center for Physics and Mathematics, project \u201dParticle Physics and Cosmology\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SYMMETRIC MATRICES M_\u039d, M_N, M_M AND RELATIONS FOR M_D \u0398^T AND \u0398^\u2020 M_D\n\n\n\nThe elements of the matrix M\u0303, see (<ref>), have the forms \n\n    M\u0303_11   =    W_11^\u2020 M_D W_21^*+W_21^\u2020 (M_D^T W_11^*+M_M W_21^*) \u2261 m_\u03bd\n    M\u0303_22   =    W_12^\u2020 M_D W_22^*+W_22^\u2020 (M_D^T W_12^*+M_M W_22^*) \u2261 M_N, \n    M\u0303_12   =    W_11^\u2020 M_D W_22^*+W_21^\u2020 (M_D^T W_12^*+M_M W_22^*) \u2261 0, \n    M\u0303_21   =    W_12^\u2020 M_D W_21^*+W_22^\u2020 (M_D^T W_11^*+M_M W_21^*) \u2261 0.\n\n\nAnalysing (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>), one can note that m_\u03bd, M_N and M_M are symmetric matrices\n\n    m_\u03bd = m_\u03bd^T,   \n    M_N = M_N^T,   \n    M_M = M_M^T,\n\nwhere for the last expression the relaton M\u0303_12-M\u0303_21^T=0 was used. \n\nIn the standard approximation, a requirement M\u0303_12=0 [see (<ref>)] has a form\n\n    \u03b8 M_M \u2243 M_D - 1/2 (\u03b8\u03b8^\u2020 M_D+M_D \u03b8^T \u03b8^*)-\u03b8 M_D^T \u03b8^*.\n\n\nMultiplying (<ref>) by \u03b8^T from the right side\n\n    \u03b8 M_M \u03b8^T \u2243 M_D \u03b8^T - 1/2 (\u03b8\u03b8^\u2020 M_D \u03b8^T +M_D \u03b8^T \u03b8^* \u03b8^T)-\u03b8 M_D^T \u03b8^* \u03b8^T\n\nand omitting terms O(\u03b8^3) (as far as |\u03b8| \u226a I), one can find \n\n    M_D \u03b8^T \u2243\u03b8 M_D^T,\n\nwhere the relation \u03b8 M_M \u03b8^T = (\u03b8 M_M \u03b8^T)^T [see (<ref>)] was applied. \n\nThe same relation (<ref>) takes place for the non-minimal approximation, where instead of (<ref>) one should use Equation\u00a0(<ref>). \n\nMultiplying (<ref>) by \u03b8^-1 from the left side\n\n    M_M \u2243\u03b8^-1 M_D - 1/2 (\u03b8^\u2020 M_D  +\u03b8^-1 M_D \u03b8^T \u03b8^*)- M_D^T \u03b8^*\n\nand using the relation (<ref>), one can rewrite the requirement M_M = M_M^T in the form\n\n    \u03b8^\u2020 M_D \u2243 M_D^T \u03b8^*.\n\n\nThe relation (<ref>) is also relevant in the non-minimal approximation.
