Let p be a prime number. Given an elliptic curve E_/, and a number field extension F/, the p-primary Selmer group of E over F is of fundamental importance and captures information about the Mordell-Weil group E(F) and the p-primary part of the Tate-Shafarevich group (E/F). The fundamental object of study in the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves is the p-primary Selmer group over the cyclotomic _p-extension, denoted Sel_p^\u221e(E/_cyc). Mazur <cit.> initiated the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves E with good ordinary reduction at p, and associated structural invariants associated with these Selmer groups.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Main results\n In this paper we consider \u03bb-invariants associated to Bloch-Kato Selmer groups attached to modular Galois representations. We prove certain qualitative and quantitative results about the levels of modular forms that arise in natural families, for which the \u03bb-invariant is prescribed to be a fixed value. We fix a cuspidal Hecke newform g of weight 2 on \u0393_0(N_g). Associated with a fixed choice of embedding \u03b9_p:\u21aa_p, let \u03c1_g be the associated Galois representation. It is assumed that the image of the residual representation \u03c1\u0305_g:Gal(/)\u2192GL_2(_p) is up to conjugation, equal to GL_2(_p). When we assume that p is odd and g is p-ordinary, the Iwasawa \u03bc and \u03bb-invariants are well defined, and denoted by \u03bc_p(g) and \u03bb_p(g) respectively (cf. section <ref>).\n\n\n   Let p\u2265 5 be a prime and let g be a normalized newform of weight 2 on \u0393_0(N_g). We assume the following conditions\n\n \n\n  * We shall assume that the image of the residual representation \u03c1\u0305_g lies in GL_2(_p). Moreover, the Galois representation\n\u03c1\u0305_g:Gal(/)\u2192GL_2(_p) is surjective.\n\n  * The modular form g is p-ordinary and p\u2224 N_g,\n\n  * g has optimal level, i.e., N_g is the prime to p part of the Artin conductor of the residual representation,\n\n  * \u03bc_p(g)=0.\n\nAssociated with g, let \u03a0_g be the set of prime numbers \u2113 such that the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n    \n  * \u2113\u2224 N_g p, \n    \n  * \u2113\u2262\u00b1 1p and \u2113^p-1\u22621p^2,\n    \n  * \u03c1\u0305_g(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113001 for a suitable choice of basis for the residual representation.\n\n\nLet \u03a9_g be the set of prime numbers such that \n\n    \n  * \u2113\u2224 N_g p, \n    \n  * \u2113\u2262\u00b1 1p,  \n  * \u03c1\u0305_g(\u03c3_\u2113)=-\u211300-1 for a suitable choice of basis for the residual representation. \n    \n    The primes \u03a0_g and \u03a9_g have Dirichlet density (p-3)/p(p-1) and (p-3)/(p-1)^2 respectively.\n\n\nLet n, r\u2208_\u2265 0 be such that max{n, r}>0. \nLet n\u2265 1 be an integer. Then for any sets of primes {q_1, \u2026, q_n}\u2282\u03a0_g and {\u2113_1, \u2026, \u2113_r}\u2282\u03a9_g, there exists a normalized newform f of weight 2 of level N_f=N_g \u00d7\u220f_i=1^n q_i\u00d7\u220f_j=1^r \u2113_j such that \n\n    \n  * f has good ordinary reduction at p, \n    \n  * \u03c1\u0305_g\u2243\u03c1\u0305_f, \n    \n  * \u03bc_p(f)=0, \n    \n  * \u03bb_p(f)=\u03bb_p(g)+n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the special case when \u03bc_p(g)=0 and \u03bb_p(g)\u2264 1, one is able to realize an infinite family of modular forms f that are p-congruent to g, for which the Bloch-Kato Selmer group over  has prescribed corank. We refer to Theorem <ref> for the statement of the result.\n\nThe following result further illustrates Theorem <ref>.\n\n\n    There is a positive density set of primes p, such that for any n\u2265 0, there exist infinitely many normalized Hecke cuspdidal newforms f of weight 2 such that \n    \n    \n  * f has good ordinary reduction at p, \n    \n  * \u03c1\u0305_f is surjective, \n    \n  * \u03bc_p(f)=0, \n    \n  * \u03bb_p(f)=n.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Relationship with previous work\n The existence of Galois representations for which the associated Selmer groups have large \u03bb-invariant has been studied by various authors, cf. <cit.>. Our results are significantly stronger since we are able to explicitly realize any large enough integer as a \u03bb-invariant. If at a given prime p\u2265 5, there exists a newform g satisfying the conditions of Theorem <ref>, and such that \u03bb_p(g)=0, then, every integer n\u2265 0 is seen to arise from a modular form which is p-congruent to g. This is indeed the case for a density 1 set of primes p, as shown by the proof of Theorem <ref>. Furthermore, not only is one able to construct infinitely many modular Galois representations giving rise to a prescribed \u03bb-invariant, one also obtains an explicit and satisfactory quantitative description of their levels. We contrast Theorem <ref> to the results of recent work by Hatley and Kundu <cit.>, where it is shown that there are infinitely many modular forms f that are p-congruent to a fixed modular form g, for which \u03bb_p(f)=\u03bb_p(g). This \u03bb-stability result requires an additional assumption on g: that the \u03bb-invariant of g is minimal in the family of all \u03bb-invariants for modular forms that are p-congruent to g. For further details, we refer to p.15 of loc. cit. This assumption is clearly satisfied when \u03bb_p(g) is 0. This \u03bb-stability result follows from Theorem <ref> in the special case when n=0, without the additional hypothesis. The method used in proving our results does draw some inspiration from <cit.>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Organization\n Including the introduction, the manuscript consists of 5 sections. In section <ref>, we set up basic notation and review the level raising theorems of Carayol (cf. Theorem <ref>) and Diamond-Taylor (cf. Theorem <ref>). In section <ref>, we describe the relationship between the Bloch-Kato and Greenberg Selmer groups over the cyclotomic _p-extension of . We describe the Iwasawa invariants associated to these Selmer groups. In section <ref>, we recall the results of Greenberg and Vatsal, and prove Theorem <ref>, which paves the way to the proof of Theorem <ref>. In section <ref>, we compute the densities of the sets \u03a0_g and \u03a9_g, and prove Theorems <ref> and <ref>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Acknowledgment\n The author's research is supported by the CRM Simons postdoctoral fellowship. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PRELIMINARIES\n\nFix an algebraic closure /, and for each prime \u2113, let _\u2113 be an algebraic closure and fix an inclusion of \u03b9_\u2113:\u21aa_\u2113. Set  to be the integral closure of  in . The choice of embedding \u03b9_\u2113 corresponds to a choice of prime \ud835\udd29|\u2113 of . The inclusion \u03b9_\u2113 induces an isomorphism of _\ud835\udd29 with _\u2113. Let G_\u2113 denote the absolute Galois group Gal(_\u2113/_\u2113). The inclusion \u03b9_\u2113 induces an inclusion of G_\u2113 into Gal(/), whose image is the decomposition group of \ud835\udd29. Let I_\u2113 be the inertia group of G_\u2113, and choose a Frobenius element \u03c3_\u2113\u2208G_\u2113. Given a Galois representation \u03c1:Gal(/)\u2192GL_2(\u00b7), let \u03c1_|\u2113 be the restriction of \u03c1 to G_\u2113. The representation \u03c1 is unramified at \u2113 if the restriction of \u03c1_|\u2113 to I_\u2113 is trivial. Fix a prime p\u2265 5 and let |p be the prime above p, corresponding to the inclusion \u03b9_p. Let f=\u2211_n=1^\u221e a_n(f)q^n be a normalized cuspidal newform of weight k\u2265 2 and \u03c1_f:Gal(/)\u2192GL_2(_p) be the associated Galois representation. The Hodge-Tate weights for the Galois representation are {k-1, 0}. We note here that this is simply a matter of convention (instead of the Hodge-Tate weights being {0, 1-k}). There is a finite extension K over _p such that w.r.t a suitable choice of basis, the image of \u03c1_f lies in GL_2(K). In greater detail, let F be a number field containing the Fourier coefficients of f, and K is the completion F_\ud835\udd2d. We set V_f\u2243 K^2 to denote the underlying Galois module for the representation \u03c1_f. Set  to denote the valuation ring of K, \u03d6 be a uniformizer of , and let \u03ba:=/(\u03d6) be the residue field of . There exists a Galois stable -lattice T_f\u2282 V_f. We shall also denote the integral representation on T_f by \u03c1_f:Gal(/) \u2192GL_2(). We denote its mod-\u03d6 reduction by \u03c1\u0305_f:Gal(/) \u2192GL_2(\u03ba). We shall assume throughout the \u03c1\u0305_f is absolutely irreducible. In this setting, it is easy to see that the Galois stable -lattice T_f is uniquely determined, and hence, there is no ambiguity in the notation used.\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The level raising results of Diamond-Taylor\n\nLet p be an odd prime number and \u03c1\u0305:Gal(/)\u2192GL_2(_p) be an irreducible Galois representation. Let c\u2208Gal(/) denote the complex conjugation; \u03c1\u0305 is odd if det\u03c1\u0305(c)=-1. Serre <cit.> conjectured that any odd and irreducible representation is modular. In greater detail, the strong form of the conjecture states that \u03c1\u0305 arises from a cuspidal newform g of weight k\u2265 2 on \u0393_1(N_\u03c1\u0305), where N_\u03c1\u0305 is the prime to p part of the Artin-conductor of \u03c1\u0305 (cf. <cit.>). The weight k=k(\u03c1\u0305) is prescribed according to <cit.>. Khare and Wintenberger <cit.> proved Serre's conjecture, building upon prior work of Ribet <cit.>. Suppose that f is a newform of weight k and level N_f coprime to p, such that the associated p-adic Galois representation \u03c1_f lifts \u03c1\u0305. Then, the optimal level N_\u03c1\u0305 divides N_f. A theorem of Carayol <cit.> proves necessary conditions for an integer N_f to arise in this way from a newform f.\n\n    Suppose there exists a modular form f of weight k of level N_f such that \u03c1\u0305=\u03c1\u0305_f is absolutely irreducible. The level N_f admits a factorization N_f=N_\u03c1\u0305\u220f_\u2113\u2113^\u03b1(\u2113), \nand for each \u2113 with \u03b1(\u2113)>0, one of the following holds:\n\n\n  * \u2113\u2224 N_\u03c1\u0305, \u2113(trace\u03c1\u0305(\u03c3_\u2113) )^2 = ( 1+\u2113)^2 det\u03c1\u0305( \u03c3_\u2113) in _p, and \u03b1(\u2113)=1;\n\n  * \u2113\u2261 -1 p and one of the following holds:\n\n\n  * \u2113\u2224 N_\u03c1\u0305, trace\u03c1\u0305(\u03c3_\u2113) \u2261 0 in _p, and \u03b1(\u2113)=2;\n\n  * \u2113 N_\u03c1\u0305, det\u03c1\u0305 is unramified at \u2113, and \u03b1(\u2113)=1;\n\n\n  * \u2113\u2261 1 p and one of the following holds:\n\n\n  * \u2113\u2224 N_\u03c1\u0305 and \u03b1(\u2113)=2;\n\n  * \u2113 N_\u03c1\u0305 and \u03b1(\u2113)=1 or \u2113\u2224 N_\u03c1\u0305 and \u03b1(\u2113)=1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    The set of levels satisfying the conditions outlined in Theorem <ref> is denoted by \ud835\udcae(\u03c1\u0305).\n\n\n\nLet p\u2265 5 be a prime, \n    \u03c1\u0305:Gal(/)\u2192GL_2(_p)\n be an irreducible Galois representation. Assume that \u03c1\u0305 arises from a newform g on \u0393_1(N_\u03c1\u0305) of weight k. Assume that k lies in the range 2\u2264 k\u2264 p-2, and let M\u2208\ud835\udcae(\u03c1\u0305). Then there exists a cuspidal newform f of weight k on \u0393_1(M), such that \u03c1\u0305_f=\u03c1\u0305. \n\nThe result of Carayol and the above level-raising result of Diamond and Taylor shows that \ud835\udcae(\u03c1\u0305) is precisely the set of levels for the cuspidal newforms f such that \u03c1\u0305_f\u2243\u03c1\u0305. \n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SELMER GROUPS ASSOCIATED TO MODULAR FORMS\n\n\nLet f=\u2211_n=1^\u221e a_n(f) q^n be a normalized new cuspform on \u0393_1(N_f) and p be an odd prime which is coprime to N_f. Let \u03c1_f:Gal(/)\u2192GL_2() be the associated Galois representation and assume that the residual representation is absolutely irreducible. Here, K/_p is a finite extension and  is the valuation ring of K. Let V_f and T_f be as defined in previous sections. We shall assume throughout that p is an ordinary prime, i.e., p\u2224 a_p(f). Set \u03bc_p^n to denote the p^n-th roots of unity in , and let (\u03bc_p^n) be the cyclotomic extension of  generated by \u03bc_p^n. Note that the Galois group Gal((\u03bc_p^n)/) is isomorphic to (/p^n)^\u00d7. Let (\u03bc_p^\u221e) be the union of cyclotomic fields (\u03bc_p^n). The Galois group Gal((\u03bc_p^\u221e)/) is isomorphic to _p^\u00d7 and decomposes into a product \u0394\u00d7_p, where \u0394 is isomorphic to /(p-1). The cyclotomic _p-extension _cyc is the field (\u03bc_p^\u221e)^\u0394 and the Galois group Gal(_cyc/) is isomorphic to _p. For n\u2265 0, the n-th layer _n/ is the extension contained in _cyc such that [_n:]=p^n.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Definition of Selmer groups\n\nLet S be a finite set of rational primes containing {p, \u221e}, and _S\u2282 be the maximal extension in which all primes \u2113\u2209 S are unramified. Setting A_f:=V_f/T_f, we note that A_f\u2243(K/)^2. Let d^\u00b1 be the dimension of the (\u00b1 1)-eigenspaces for complex conjugation. We note that d^+=d^-=1. Since we assume that f is p-ordinary, there exists a 1-dimensional, K-subspace W_f\u2286 V_f of dimension 1, which is stable under the action of G_p. Let C be the image of W_f in A_f, with respect to the mod-T_f map V_f\u2192 A_f, and set D=A_f/C. \n\nWe assume that the set S contains all primes dividing N_f. Let L be an extension of  which is contained in _cyc. Thus L is the field _n for some n\u2265 0, or is the field _cyc. Given a rational prime \u2113, set \u2113(L) to be the set of primes of L that lie above \u2113. We note that the set \u2113(_cyc) is finite. Given a prime w of _cyc, let _cyc, w be the union of all completions of p-adic fields contained in _cyc at w. Given a prime \u2113\u2208 S, the Greenberg local Selmer condition _\u2113(L, A_f) is defined as follows. For \u2113\u2260 p, the local condition is defined by \n    _\u2113(L, A_f):=\u220f_w\u2208\u2113(L) H^1(L_w,A_f).\n The local condition at \u2113=p is defined differently. Let \u03b7_p be the unique prime of L that lies above p; let I_\u03b7_p denote the inertia subgroup of Gal(L\u0305_\u03b7_p/L_\u03b7_p). Let \n\n    H_\u03b7_p:=ker(H^1(L_\u03b7_p, A_f)\u27f6 H^1(I_\u03b7_p, D)),\n and set \n\n    _p(L, A_f):=H^1(L_\u03b7_p, A_f)/H_\u03b7_p.\n\nFollowing <cit.>, the Greenberg Selmer group Sel^Gr(L, A_f) is then defined as follows\n\n    Sel^Gr(L, A_f):=ker(H^1(_S/L,A_f)\u27f6\u2295_\u2113\u2208 S_\u2113(L, A_f)).\n\nFor \u2113\u2208 S, _\u2113(_cyc, A_f) is a cofinitely generated _p-module (cf. <cit.>). We let \u03c3_\u2113(f) denote the -corank of _\u2113(_cyc, A_f). For \u2113\u2260 p, we describe an algorithm to compute \u03c3_\u2113(f). Let V_f' be the quotient (V_f)_I_\u2113 and P_\u2113(f;X) be the mod-\u03d6 reduction of P_\u2113(f;X):=det(Id-\u03c3_\u2113 X| V_f'). Let s_\u2113 be the number of primes of _cyc that lie above \u2113. Note that s_\u2113 is the maximal power of p such that \u2113^p-1\u2261 1ps_\u2113. Let d_\u2113(f) be the multiplicity of \u2113^-1 as a root of P_\u2113(f;X). By <cit.>, it follows that \u03c3_\u2113(f) is given by\n\n    \u03c3_\u2113(f)=s_\u2113 d_\u2113(f).\n\n\nGiven a number field L/ contained in _cyc, we set Sel^BK(L, A_f) denote the Bloch-Kato Selmer group associated to A_f, cf. <cit.> or <cit.> for the precise definition. The Bloch-Kato Selmer group over _cyc is defined as the direct limit\n\n    Sel^BK(_cyc,A_f):=_n Sel^BK(_n,A_f).\n\n\n\nWith respect to notation above, there is a natural map \n    Sel^BK(_cyc, A_f)\u2192Sel^Gr(_cyc, A_f)\nwith finite kernel and cokernel. \n\n\n    The result above is <cit.>.\n\n\nFrom the point of view of Iwasawa theory, we may work with either Selmer group Sel^BK(_cyc, A_f) or Sel^Gr(_cyc, A_f). It conveniences us to work with the Greenberg Selmer group, and for ease of notation, we simply set \n    Sel(_cyc, A_f):=Sel^Gr(_cyc, A_f).\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Iwasawa invariants\n\n\nWe set \u0393:=Gal(_cyc/) and \u039b denote the Iwasawa algebra \u0393:=_n [\u0393/\u0393^p^n]. Given a module M over \u039b, we shall set M^\u2228:=Hom_cnts(M, _p/_p). A module M over \u039b is said to be cofinitely generated (resp. cotorsion) if M^\u2228 is finitely generated (resp. torsion) as a module over \u039b. The Selmer group Sel(_cyc, A_f) is a cofinitely generated module over \u039b. There are many cases of interest for which it is known to be cotorsion over \u039b, which we shall further discuss in the next subsection. Given \u039b-modules M and M', a pseudo-isomorphism is a map of \u039b-modules M\u2192 M' whose kernel and cokernel both have finite cardinality. Let M be a cofinitely generated and cotorsion \u039b-module, then, as is well known, there is a pseudo-isomorphism \n\n    M\u27f6(\u2295_i=1^s \u039b/(\u03d6^m_i))\u2295(\u2295_j=1^t \u039b/(f_j(T)^n_j)).\n In the above sum, s, t, m_i, n_i\u2208_\u2265 0, and f_j(T) is an irreducible distinguished polynomial in \u039b, i.e., an irreducible monic polynomial whose non-leading coefficients are divisible by \u03d6. The \u03bc-invariant is given by \n\n    \u03bc_p(M):=\u2211_i m_i     if s>0;\n    \n    0     if s=0.\n\nOn the other hand, the \u03bb-invariant is given by \n\n    \u03bb_p(M):=\u2211_j n_jdeg(f_j)     if t>0;\n    \n    0     if t=0.\n\n It follows from results of Kato <cit.> that Sel(_cyc/A_f) is a cotorsion module over \u039b. Then, the \u03bc (resp. \u03bb) invariant of Sel(_cyc, A_f) is denoted by \u03bc_p(f) (resp. \u03bb_p(g)). We note that \u03bc_p(f)=0 if and only if Sel(_cyc, A_f) is cofinitely generated as an -module, and in this case, \n    \u03bb_p(f)=corank_(Sel(_cyc, A_f)).\n It follows from Proposition <ref> that the \u03bb-invariant of Sel(_cyc, A_f) is equal to the \u03bb-invariant of Sel^BK(_cyc, A_f). We shall set rank^BK(f) to denote the -corank of the Bloch-Kato Selmer group Sel^BK(, A_f). \n\n    Assume the \u03bc_p(f)=0. The following assertions hold:\n    \n\n  *  rank^BK(f)\u2264\u03bb_p(f),\n\n  *  rank^BK(f)\u2261\u03bb_p(f)2,\n\n  * \nsuppose that \u03bb_p(f)\u2264 1, then, rank^BK(f)= \u03bb_p(f).\n    \n\n\n\nPart (<ref>) follows as a direct consequence of <cit.>. Part (<ref>) follows from a standard argument due to Greenberg <cit.>, see <cit.>. Part (<ref>) is a direct consequence of (<ref>) and (<ref>).\n\n\nWe note that the conventions used here are the same as those in <cit.>. Note that the ring  is chosen to be the valuation ring of F_. It is easy to see that the definition of the \u03bb-invariant \u03bb_p(f) is independent of the choice of field F, and thus the valuation ring . Also, we note that the \u03bc-invariant vanishes for the Selmer group over , if and only if it vanishes after base-change by any valuation ring '/. \n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONGRUENCE RELATIONS BETWEEN SELMER GROUPS\n\nWe recall some results of Greenberg and Vatsal <cit.>, and apply these results to study the structure of Selmer groups of ordinary Galois representations. Let g be a Hecke newform of weight 2 on \u0393_0(N_g). Here, N_g is the level of g. Assume that the following conditions are satisfied\n \n\n  * p\u2224 N_g,\n\n  * g is ordinary at p,\n\n  * \u03c1\u0305:=\u03c1\u0305_g is absolutely irreducible,\n\n  * g has optimal level, i.e., N_g is the prime to p part of the Artin conductor of \u03c1\u0305. \n\nLet f be a Hecke new cuspform of weight 2 on such that \u03c1\u0305_f\u2243\u03c1\u0305_g. The understanding here is that the field F is chosen so that all the Fourier coefficients of both f and g are contained in F. Remark <ref> establishes that one may choose any large field F when studying the \u03bb-invariant vanishing of the \u03bc-invariant. Let N_f be the level of f. We assume that p\u2224 N_f. Note that by Theorem <ref>, N_f\u2208\ud835\udcae(\u03c1\u0305). We note that N_g divides N_f. We note that f has ordinary reduction at p (cf. <cit.>). Let \u03f5_f be the nebentype of f, and \u03f5\u0305_f:Gal(/)\u2192\u03ba^\u00d7 its mod-\u03d6 reduction. We find that det\u03c1\u0305_g=\u03c7\u0305, and det\u03c1\u0305_g=\u03c7\u0305\u03f5\u0305_f where \u03c7\u0305 is the mod-p cyclotomic character. Since \u03c1\u0305_f\u2243\u03c1\u0305_g, we find that \u03f5\u0305_f=1. The principal units in ^\u00d7 are the units that reduce to 1 modulo (\u03d6). It is clear that if a principal unit is a root of unity, then it is equal to 1. Since \u03f5_f is a finite order character, \u03f5\u0305_f=1 implies that \u03f5_f=1. Therefore, f is a weight 2 cuspform on \u0393_0(N_f).\n\n\n   With respect to above notation, assume that \u03bc_p(g)=0. Then, \u03bc_p(f)=0, and \n    \n    \u03bb_p(f)-\u03bb_p(g)=\u2211_\u2113| N_f(\u03c3_\u2113(g)-\u03c3_\u2113(f)),\n where the sum ranges over the primes \u2113 dividing N_f. \n\n\nWe study the numbers (\u03c3_\u2113(g)-\u03c3_\u2113(f)) for primes \u2113|N_f. Let A be a local -algebra, with maximal ideal \ud835\udd2a_A, and residue field A/\ud835\udd2a_A isomorphic to \u03ba. Fix an -algebra isomorphism \u03c6_0: A/\ud835\udd2a_A\u2192\u03ba. Let \u03c6:A\u2192\u03ba be the map obtained upon composing the reduction modulo \ud835\udd2a_A map, with \u03c6_0. We set \n    GL_2(A):={abcd\u2208GL_2(A)|\u03c6(a)\u03c6(b)\u03c6(c)\u03c6(d)=1001}.\n \nFor n\u2265 1, the map \u03c6:/\u03d6^n\u2192\u03ba is the reduction modulo \u03d6 map.\n\nAssociated with g, let \u03a0_g be the set of prime numbers \u2113 such that the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n    \n  * \u2113\u2224 N_g p, \n    \n  * \u2113\u2262\u00b1 1p and \u2113^p-1\u22621p^2,\n    \n  * \u03c1\u0305_g(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113001 for a suitable choice of basis for the residual representation. \n\nLet \u03a9_g be the set of prime numbers such that \n\n    \n  * \u2113\u2224 N_g p, \n    \n  * \u2113\u2262\u00b1 1p,  \n  * \u03c1\u0305_g(\u03c3_\u2113)=-\u211300-1 for a suitable choice of basis for the residual representation. \n\n\n\nIn section <ref>, we shall introduce further assumptions on the image of \u03c1\u0305_g, so that the sets \u03a0_g and \u03a9_g have positive density. For \u2113\u2208\u03a0_g (resp. \u03a9_g), we note that \u03c1_g is unramified at \u2113. Since \u03c1\u0305_f\u2243\u03c1\u0305_g, we find that \u03c1\u0305_f is unramified at \u2113 as well. Thus, \u03c1_f(I_\u2113) is contained in GL_2(), which is a pro-p group. Hence, \u03c1_f|\u2113 factors through Gal(_\u2113^p-tr/_\u2113), where _\u2113^p-tr\u2282_\u2113 is the maximal tamely ramified extension of _\u2113 with pro-p inertia. The Galois group Gal(_\u2113^p-tr/_\u2113) is generated by a frobenius \u03c3_\u2113, and the pro-p tame inertia generator \u03c4_\u2113, subject to the relation \u03c3_\u2113\u03c4_\u2113\u03c3_\u2113^-1=\u03c4_\u2113^\u2113 (cf. for instance <cit.>).\n\n\n   Let \u2113\u2208\u03a0_g be a prime such that \u03c1_f is ramified at \u2113. Then, up to conjugation by a matrix in GL_2(),\n    \n    \u03c1_f(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113 xx and \u03c1_f(\u03c4_\u2113)=1y1,\n where x\u2261 1\u03d6 and y\u2261 0\u03d6.\n\n\n\nWe choose an integral basis for T_f so that \u03c1\u0305_f(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113001. We show that there is a matrix A\u2208GL_2() so that \u03c1:=A \u03c1_f A^-1 satisfies the above conditions. In fact, the matrix A can be chosen to be in GL_2(). \n\n    For ease of notation, we set \u03c1':=\u03c1_f and \u03c1'_n denote the \u03d6^n reduction of \u03c1'. We shall inductively specify matrices A_n \u2208GL_2(/\u03d6^n) such that A_m\u2261 A_n \u03d6^n for all integers m>n. We shall then let A denote the matrix (A_n) in the inverse limit \n    \n    GL_2()=_n GL_2(/\u03d6^n).\n Let us set \u03c1_n:=A_n \u03c1_n' A_n^-1. The matrices A_n shall have the property that there exist x_n, y_n, z_n\u2208/\u03d6^n such that \u03c1_n(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113 x_nz_n and \u03c1_n(\u03c4_\u2113)=1y_n1, where x_n, z_n\u2261 1\u03d6 and y_n\u2261 0\u03d6. Since A_m \u2261 A_n \u03d6^n for all m>n, it shall then follow that x_m\u2261 x_n\u03d6^n, y_m\u2261 y_n\u03d6^n and z_m\u2261 z_n\u03d6^n. Setting x,y,z to denote the inverse limits (x_n), (y_n) and (z_n) respectively, we find that \n    \n    \u03c1(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113 xz and \u03c1(\u03c4_\u2113)=1y1.\n The relation \u03c3_\u2113\u03c4_\u2113\u03c3_\u2113^-1=\u03c4_\u2113^\u2113 then implies that x=z. \nSuppose that for some n\u2265 1, \n\n    \u03c1_n(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113 x_nz_n and \u03c1(\u03c4_\u2113)=1y_n1.\n\nIt suffices to lift A_n to A_n+1\u2208GL_2(/\u03d6^n+1), so that \n\n    \u03c1_n+1(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113 x_n+1z_n+1 and \u03c1_n+1(\u03c4_\u2113)=1y_n+11,\n\nwhere x_n+1, y_n+1, z_n+1 lift x_n, y_n and z_n respectively.\nLet B_n+1\u2208GL_2(/\u03d6^n+1) be a lift of A_n, and set r_n+1:=B_n+1\u03c1_n+1 B_n+1^-1. Note that \u03c1_n=r_n+1\u03d6^n. Therefore, we may write \n    r_n+1(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113x\u0303_nz\u0303_n+\u03d6^nabcd;\n        r_n+1(\u03c4_\u2113)=1y_n01+\u03d6^nefgh.\n Let B:=(Id+\u03d6^n a'b'c'd')\u2208GL_2(/\u03d6^n+1), we set r_n+1':=B r_n+1 B^-1. Note that since \u03d6^2n=0 in /\u03d6^n+1, B^-1=(Id-\u03d6^n a'b'c'd'). Let B':= a'b'c'd', write B:=Id+\u03d6^n B'. Given a matrix M\u2208GL_2(/\u03d6^n+1), we find that \n    \n    B M B^-1   =(Id+\u03d6^nB')M (Id-\u03d6^nB')\n       =M+\u03d6^n[B', M],\nwhere [B',M]:=B'M-MB'. Note that \u03d6^n [B', M] is determined by the reduction of M modulo \u03d6. In particular, if M\u2261Id\u03d6, then, [B',M]=0, and B M B^-1=M. On the other hand, if M\u2261\u21131\u03d6, then, \n    \n    B MB^-1=M+\u03d6^n(1-\u2113)b'(\u2113-1)c'.\n\n    From the above computations, we find that \n    \n    r_n+1'(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113x\u0303_nz\u0303_n+\u03d6^nab+(1-\u2113)b'c+(\u2113-1)c'd;\n        r_n+1'(\u03c4_\u2113)=1y_n01+\u03d6^nefgh.\n\n    Since \u2113\u22621p, we may choose B so that r_n+1'(\u03c3_\u2113) is diagonal. In greater detail, b':=b/(\u2113-1) and c':=c/(1-\u2113), and set a'=0 and d'=0. Thus, we write \n    r_n+1'(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113 x_n+1z_n+1.\n\n    We find that \n    \n    r_n+1'(\u03c3_\u2113\u03c4_\u2113\u03c3_\u2113^-1)=    \u2113 x_n+1z_n+11+\u03d6^n ey_n+\u03d6^n f\u03d6^n g1+\u03d6^n h\u2113 x_n+1z_n+1^-1, \n    \n       =    1+\u03d6^n e\u2113 x_n+1z_n+1^-1(y_n+\u03d6^n f)\u03d6^n \u2113^-1x_n+1z_n+1^-1g1+\u03d6^n h,\n    \n       =    1+\u03d6^n e\u2113 x_n+1z_n+1^-1y_n+\u03d6^n \u2113 f\u03d6^n \u2113^-1g1+\u03d6^n h,\n    \n       r_n+1'(\u03c4_\u2113)^\u2113=   1+\u03d6^n \u2113 e\u2113y_n+\u03d6^n \u2113 f\u03d6^n \u2113 g1+\u03d6^n \u2113 h.\n\n   Since \u2113\u2262\u00b1 1p, we find that e=g=h=0. Hence, we find that \n    r_n+1'(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113 x_n+1z_n+1;\n        r_n+1'(\u03c4_\u2113)=1y_n+11.\n\n    We set A_n+1:=B B_n+1, we note that A_n\u2261 B_n+1\u03d6^n, and B\u2261Id\u03d6^n. With respect to this choice, \u03c1_n+1=r_n+1', and A_n=A_n+1\u03d6^n. This completes the inductive lifting argument. By previous remarks in the proof, this is enough to establish the result. \n\n\n\nLet \u2113\u2224 N_gp be a prime that divides N_f. Then, the following assertions hold.\n    \n        \n  *  If \u2113\u2208\u03a0_g, then, \u03c3_\u2113(g)=1 and \u03c3_\u2113(f)=0.\n        \n  *  If \u2113\u2208\u03a9_g, then, \u03c3_\u2113(g)=0 and \u03c3_\u2113(f)=0.\n     \n\n\n\n    We begin by proving part (<ref>). Since \u03c1_g is unramified at \u2113, we find that V'_g=V_g. Since \u03c1\u0305_g(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u21131, it follows that P_\u2113(g;X)=(1-X)(1-\u2113 X). Since \u2113\u22621p, it follows that \u2113^-1 is a root of P_\u2113(g;X) with multiplicity 1. Therefore, d_\u2113(g)=1. On the other hand, it follows from Lemma <ref> that V_f' is the trivial G_\u2113-module, we find that P_\u2113(f;X)=1-X, and \u2113^-1 is not a root of P_\u2113(f;X). Therefore, d_\u2113(f)=0. Since \u2113^p-1\u22621p^2, it follows that that s_\u2113=1. Since \u03c3_\u2113(\u00b7)=s_\u2113 d_\u2113(\u00b7), we find that \u03c3_\u2113(g)=1 and \u03c3_\u2113(f)=0. The second assertion can be argued in the same way. \n\n\nLet Q={q_1, \u2026, q_n} be a set of primes contained in \u03a0_g and Q'={\u2113_1, \u2026, \u2113_r}. For (n, r)\u2208_\u2265 0^2, we set T(n, r) be the collection of all sets \u03a3=Q\u222a Q', where Q={q_1, \u2026, q_n} (resp. Q'={\u2113_1, \u2026, \u2113_r}) is a subset of \u03a0_g (resp. \u03a9_g). The understanding is that when n=0 (resp. r=0), the set Q (resp. Q') is empty. When we write \u03a3={q_1, \u2026, q_n, \u2113_1, \u2026, \u2113_r}, we shall implicitly mean that {q_1, \u2026, q_n} is contained in \u03a0_g and {\u2113_1, \u2026, \u2113_r} is contained in \u03a9_g.\n\n\n    For \u03a3\u2208T(n, r), set N_\u03a3:=\u220f_i=1^n q_i\u00d7\u220f_j=1^r \u2113_j. Let (\u03a3) be the set of newforms f of weight 2 such that \n    \n        \n  * \u03c1\u0305_f\u2243\u03c1\u0305_g, \n        \n  * N_f=N_g N_\u03a3.\n    \n\n\n\n    Let g be a Hecke newform of optimal weight k=2 and optimal level. Then, for (n, r) such that n>0 or r>0, and \u03a3\u2208T(n, r), the set (\u03a3) is nonempty.\n\n\n\n    The result is a direct consequence of Theorem <ref>.\n\n\n\n    Let f\u2208(\u03a3), and let \u2113\u2260 p be a prime which divides N_g. Then, \u03c3_\u2113(f)=\u03c3_\u2113(g).\n\n\n    It suffices for us to show that d_\u2113(f)=d_\u2113(g). Let h\u2208{g,f}, recall that V_h':=(V_h)_I_\u2113. Note that as a modules over the inertia group I_\u2113, V_h and A_h[\u03d6] are self dual. Since ord_\u2113(N_f)=ord_\u2113(N_g), and N_g is the prime to p part of the Artin-conductor of \u03c1\u0305, it follows that \n    dim A_h[\u03d6]_I_\u2113=dim (V_h)_I_\u2113,\n(cf. <cit.>). Recall that P_\u2113(h;X):=det(Id-\u03c3_\u2113 X| V_h') and that P_\u2113(h;X) is the mod-\u03d6 reduction of P_\u2113(h;X). Set T_h':=(T_h)_I_\u2113. We identify A_h[\u03d6] with T_h/\u03d6 T_h, and thus A_h[\u03d6]_I_\u2113 with T_h'/\u03d6 T_h'. The equality (<ref>) implies that T_h' is torsion free. We identify T_h'\u2297_ K with V_h', and since T_h' is torsion free, we find that T_h' is an -lattice in V_h', and that P_\u2113(h;X)=det(Id-\u03c3_\u2113 X| T_h'). Therefore, the mod-\u03d6 reduction of P_\u2113(h;X) is given by \n    P_\u2113(h;X) =   det(Id-\u03c3_\u2113 X|(T_h'/\u03d6 T_h')),\n    \n        =   det(Id-\u03c3_\u2113 X| A_h[\u03d6]_I_\u2113),\n\nSince A_g[\u03d6]\u2243 A_f[\u03d6] as G_\u2113-modules, we find that A_g[\u03d6]_I_\u2113\u2243 A_f[\u03d6]_I_\u2113 as G_\u2113/I_\u2113-modules. It thus follows that P_\u2113(f;X)=P_\u2113(g;X), from which we deduce that d_\u2113(f)=d_\u2113(g). \n\n\n\n Let g be a Hecke newform of optimal level N_g, trivial nebentype and weight 2. Assume that the following conditions are satisfied\n \n\n  * \u03c1\u0305_g is absolutely irreducible,\n\n  * g is p-ordinary and p\u2224 N_g,\n\n  * g has optimal level,\n\n  * \u03bc_p(g)=0.\n\n   Let \u03a3\u2208\ud835\udd17(n, r) and f\u2208(\u03a3). Then, the following assertions hold\n   \n       \n  * f has good ordinary reduction at p,\n       \n  * \u03bc_p(f)=0,\n       \n  * \u03bb_p(f)=\u03bb_p(g)+n.\n   \n\n\n    As noted earlier, that f has ordinary reduction at p follows from <cit.>. From Theorem <ref>, we find that \u03bc_p(f)=0 and \n    \n    \u03bb_p(f)=\u03bb_p(g)+\u2211_i=1^n (\u03c3_q_i(g)-\u03c3_q_i(f))+\u2211_j=1^r (\u03c3_\u2113_j(g)-\u03c3_\u2113_j(f))+\u2211_\u2113|N_g(\u03c3_\u2113(g)-\u03c3_\u2113(f)).\n\n    For \u2113|N_g, it follows from Lemma <ref> that \n    \n    \u2211_\u2113|N_g(\u03c3_\u2113(g)-\u03c3_\u2113(f))=0.\n\n    It follows from (<ref>) of Lemma <ref> that \n    \n    (\u03c3_q_i(g)-\u03c3_q_i(f))=1\n and it follows from (<ref>) of Lemma <ref> that \n    \n    (\u03c3_\u2113_j(g)-\u03c3_\u2113_j(f))=0.\n\n    It therefore follows that \n    \n    \u03bb_p(f)=\u03bb_p(g)+n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONSTRUCTING GALOIS REPRESENTATIONS WITH PRESCRIBED \u039b-INVARIANT\n\nThroughout this section, p\u2265 5. We introduce our assumptions. Let g be a normalized newform of weight 2 on \u0393_0(N_g). Throughout this section, we assume the following conditions.\n\n \n\n  * The residue field \u03ba=/\u03d6 is _p, i.e., f(\ud835\udd2d/p)=1 where \ud835\udd2d is the prime above p prescribed by \u03b9_p.  \n\n  * The Galois representation\n\u03c1\u0305_g:Gal(/)\u2192GL_2(_p) is surjective.\n\n  * The modular form g is p-ordinary and p\u2224 N_g,\n\n  * g has optimal level,\n\n  * \u03bc_p(g)=0.\n\n\nWe show that the sets \u03a0_g and \u03a9_g both have positive density. Furthermore, we estimate these densities. We let Y (resp. Y') be the subset of GL_2(_p) consisting of semisimple matrices conjugate to a1 (resp. a-1), where a\u2260\u00b1 1. It is easy to see that \n\n    # Y =# Y'= (p-3)#GL_2(_p)/#T(_p),\n where T denotes the diagonal torus. Therefore, we find that \n\n    # Y /#GL_2(_p)=# Y'/#GL_2(_p)=(p-3)/(p-1)^2.\n\nLet \u03c1\u0305 denote the residual representation \u03c1\u0305_g, and let (\u03c1\u0305) be the Galois extension of  which is the fixed field of the kernel of \u03c1\u0305. We refer to (\u03c1\u0305) as the field cut out by \u03c1\u0305. We set G to denote the Galois group Gal((\u03c1\u0305)/). The residual representation induces an isomorphism \u03a6: GGL_2(_p). Let Z (resp. Z') denote \u03a6^-1(Y) (resp. \u03a6^-1(Y')). It follows from (<ref>) that \n\n    # Z /# G=# Z'/# G=(p-3)/(p-1)^2.\n\n\n\n    Let \u2113\u2224 N_g p be a prime. The following assertions hold\n    \n        \n  * \u03c3_\u2113\u2208 Z if and only if \u03c1\u0305(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u21131 up to conjugation and \u2113\u2262\u00b1 1p;\n         \n  * \u03c3_\u2113\u2208 Z' if and only if \u03c1\u0305(\u03c3_\u2113)=-\u2113-1 up to conjugation and \u2113\u2262\u00b1 1p.\n    \n\n\n    Suppose that \u03c3_\u2113\u2208 Z (resp. \u03c3_\u2113\u2208 Z'). Then, since the weight of g is 2 and has trivial nebentype, we find that det\u03c1\u0305(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113. It follows that \u03c1\u0305(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u21131 (resp. \u03c1\u0305(\u03c3_\u2113)=-\u2113-1) and \u2113\u2262\u00b1 1p.\n\n\n\n    Let \u2113\u2224 N_g p be a prime. Then, \u03c3_\u2113\u2208 Z' if and only if \u2113\u2208\u03a9_g. As a consequence, it follows that \u03a9_g has positive density equal to (p-3)/(p-1)^2.\n\n\n    We find that \u03c3_\u2113\u2208 Z' if and only if \u03c1\u0305(\u03c3_\u2113)=\u2113-1 up to conjugation and \u2113\u2262\u00b1 1p. In other words, \u03c3_\u2113\u2208 Z' if and only if \u2113\u2208\u03a9_g. By the Chebotarev density theorem, \u03a9_g has positive density equal to # Z'/# G=(p-3)/(p-1)^2.\n\n\nRecall that _1 is the /p-extension of  contained in _cyc. Let / be the compositum (\u03c1\u0305)\u00b7_1. \n\n    The extensions (\u03c1\u0305) and _1 are linearly disjoint. \n\n\n    Let E:=(\u03c1\u0305)\u2229_1 and N:=Gal((\u03c1\u0305)/E). Note that N is a normal subgroup of G\u2243GL_2(_p) and that [G:N] divides p. For p\u2265 5, the group PSL_2(_p) is simple. It is easy to see that GL_2(_p) does not contain an index p normal subgroup. Therefore, N=G and thus, (\u03c1\u0305) and _1 are linearly disjoint.\n\n\nLet \u0393_1:=Gal(_1/) and we find that Gal(/)\u2243 G\u00d7\u0393_1. Let W be the product Z\u00d7 (\u0393_1\\{0}). \n\n\n    Let \u2113\u2224 N_gp be a prime. Then, \u03c3_\u2113\u2208 W if and only if \u2113\u2208\u03a0_g. As a result, \u03a0_g has density equal to (p-3)/p(p-1).\n\n\n    Note that the prime \u2113 in nonsplit in _1 if and only if \u2113^p-1\u22621p^2. The result is therefore a direct consequence of Lemma <ref>. By the Chebotarev density theorem, \u03a0_g has density equal to\n    \n    #Z\u00d7 (#\u0393_1-1)/#G \u00d7#\u0393_1=(p-3)/p(p-1).\n\n\n\n\n    The Theorem is a direct consequence of Proposition <ref>, Proposition <ref> and Theorem <ref>.\n\n\n\n     Let p\u2265 5 be a prime and let g be a normalized newform of weight 2 on \u0393_0(N_g) satisfying all of the conditions of Theorem <ref>. Furthermore, assume that \u03bb_p(g)\u2264 1. Then, for any set of primes {\u2113_1, \u2026, \u2113_r}\u2282\u03a9_g, there is a Hecke newform of weight 2 of level N_f=N_g\u2113_1\u2026\u2113_r such that \n     \n    \n  * f has good ordinary reduction at p, \n    \n  * \u03c1\u0305_g\u2243\u03c1\u0305_f, \n    \n  * \u03bc_p(f)=0, \n    \n  * rank^BK(f)=\u03bb_p(g).\n\n\n\n\n    It follows from Theorem <ref> that there exists f satisfying the first three assertions, and such that \u03bb_p(f)=\u03bb_p(g). Proposition <ref> implies that \n    \n    rank^BK(f)=\u03bb_p(f)=\u03bb_p(g).\n This proves the last assertion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    It suffices to show that there is a non-CM Hecke newform g of weight 2 on \u0393_0(N_g) and a density 1 set of primes \u03a3 such that for all p\u2208\u03a3,\n    \n        \n  * p\u2265 5, \n        \n  * The residue field \u03ba=/\u03d6 is _p, i.e., f(\ud835\udd2d/p)=1. \n\n  * The Galois representation\n\u03c1\u0305_g:Gal(/)\u2192GL_2(_p) is surjective.\n\n  * The modular form g is p-ordinary and p\u2224 N_g,\n\n  * g has optimal level, i.e., N_g is the prime to p part of the Artin conductor of the residual representation,\n\n  * \u03bc_p(g)=0 and \u03bb_p(g)=0.\n    \nIt then follows from Theorem <ref> that for p\u2208\u03a3, there are infinitely many Hecke newforms of weight 2 such that \n \n    \n  * f has good ordinary reduction at p, \n    \n  * \u03c1\u0305_f is surjective, \n    \n  * \u03bc_p(f)=0, \n    \n  * \u03bb_p(f)=n.\n\nLet E_/ be any non-CM elliptic curve with Mordell-Weil rank 0, and let g be the associated Hecke newform. Consider the following observations.\n\n    \n  * The field of Fourier coefficients of g is , since it is associated to an elliptic curve over . In particular, it follows that the residue field \u03ba is isomorphic to _p for all primes p.\n    \n  * The set of primes at which E has good ordinary reduction has density 1, by a result of Serre <cit.>.\n    \n  * Serre's open image theorem <cit.> shows that for all but finitely many primes p, the residual representation \u03c1\u0305_g:Gal(/)\u2192GL_2(_p) is surjective. \n    \n  * If at a given prime p, N_g is not optimal, then there must be a p-congruence between g and a newform h of weight 2 and strictly smaller level. This follows from Ribet's level lowering theorem. There are only finitely many newforms of weight 2 with level strictly less than N_g. Also, there are only finitely many primes p for which two newforms are p-congruent. Therefore, for all but finitely many primes p, the level N_g is optimal. \n    \n  * Finally, it follows from a theorem of Greenberg <cit.> that for a density 1 set of primes p, \u03bc_p(g)=\u03bb_p(g)=0. \n    Therefore, there is a set of primes \u03a3 of density 1 such that the above conditions are satisfied. This completes the proof.\n\n\n\nalpha\n\n"}
