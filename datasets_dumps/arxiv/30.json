K-complexity traces such operator size growth and thus provides physicists with deep insights to many fundamental questions in non-equilibrium dynamics\u00a0<cit.>.    \n\nThe study of K-complexity is based on the Lanczos algorithm\u00a0<cit.>. \nIn the Heisenberg picture, an operator is denoted by \ud835\udcaa\u0302(t)=\u2211_m,n\ud835\udcaa_mn|m\u27e9\u27e8n|, where t is the time, |m\u27e9 is a set of orthogonal eigenstates and \ud835\udcaa_mn are the matrix elements. \ud835\udcaa\u0302(t) may be regarded as a state in the operator space and thus can be denoted as |\ud835\udcaa(t))\u2261\u2211_m,n\ud835\udcaa_mn|m\u27e9\u2297|n\u27e9. \nUsing the Krylov basis |\ud835\udcaa_n), an ordered set of mutual orthogonal operators,   \n\n    |\ud835\udcaa(t))=\u2211_n \u03d5_n(t)|\ud835\udcaa_n),\n \nwhere |\ud835\udcaa_0)=|\ud835\udcaa(t=0)). |\ud835\udcaa_n\u22600) is generated by commutators of \ud835\udcaa\u0302_0 and \u0124 recursively using the Lanczos algorithm. \nFor instance, |\ud835\udcaa_1)=b_1^-1|[H,\ud835\udcaa_0]), where the normalization constant b_1 is introduced such that (\ud835\udcaa_n|\ud835\udcaa_n)=(\ud835\udcaa_0|\ud835\udcaa_0). \nThe inner product in operator space is defined as (A|B)=(A^\u2020 B).\nThe other Krylov basis states are defined recursively by |\ud835\udcaa_n)=b_n^-1(|[H,\ud835\udcaa_n-1])-b_n-1|\ud835\udcaa_n-2)). \nK-complexity is defined as \n\n    C_K(t)=\u2211_n n|\u03d5_n(t)|^2,\n\nwhich can be viewed as the expectation value of the Krylov operator \n\n    K\u0302_\ud835\udcaa=\u2211_n n |\ud835\udcaa_n)(\ud835\udcaa_n|.\n\nIntuitively, Eq.(<ref>) describes the mean width of a wavepacket in the Krylov space and thus quantitatively measures how the size of the operator increases as time goes by. \nWhereas it was hypothesized that C_K has the fastest growth in a chaotic system\u00a0<cit.>, recent studies have shown that similar behaviors of C_K may arise in non-chaotic systems\u00a0<cit.>.   \n\nDespite the exciting development in the study of K-complexity, a fundamental question remains. \nThe Lanczos algorithm only provides an ordered Krylov basis but does not supply a distance among them.  \nTo obtain the operator size described by Eq.(<ref>), |\ud835\udcaa_n) are assumed to be equally spaced. \nAs such, any quantitative results of K-complexity are built upon the choice that the distance between |\ud835\udcaa_n) and |\ud835\udcaa_0) has been chosen as n. \nIn practice, substituting n by any other function h(n) shall change all results of K-complexity. \nAt a more fundamental level, without prior knowledge of the geometry of the operator space, any choice of the distance between |O_n) could be regarded as ambiguous. \nIt is thus desirable to define K-complexity rigorously by specifying the geometry of the Krylov space where |\ud835\udcaa_n) live.  \n\nHere, we show K-complexity can be systematically established from circuit (C-) complexity, a concept that originated from quantum computation and is now being widely used in many other areas including high energy physics and condensed matter physics\u00a0<cit.>. \nIn quantum computation, C-complexity describes the smallest number of gates to reach a target state from a reference state. \nIt can be visualized using Nielsen's geometric approach, which provides a metric for operators such that C-complexity is given by the geodesic in the space of circuits\u00a0<cit.>. \nCompared to other definitions of the metric in operator space, such as the trace distance\u00a0<cit.>, a unique advantage of circuit complexity is that the distance between operators has a clear physical interpretation. \nA longer(shorter) path corresponds to more (less) gates required to evolve from one operator to the other.  \nApplying circuit complexity to non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, it can be understood as the shortest time to reach a desired state and thus allows experimentalists to optimize quantum controls\u00a0<cit.>.   \n\nWe have found that K-complexity measures the height of the time-dependent operator along a particular direction in the operator space. \nFor instance, in systems with SU(2) symmetry, the metric of all operators involved in quantum dynamics forms a sphere. \nAs shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref> (A), the initial operator |\ud835\udcaa(0)) is placed at the south pole.  \nThe length of a trajectory starting from the south pole along a big circle provides us with the circuit complexity. \nProjecting this trajectory to the z-axis, the K-complexity is the height of the final operator measured from the south pole. \nOur results also show that the distance between Krylov basis states is rigorously determined by the circuit complexity. \nHere, the Krylov basis states correspond to strips along latitudes on the sphere. \nSuch a distance turns out to be variable once it becomes easier or more difficult to change the operators in some directions in the operator space. \n\nWe note that the geometric interpretation of K-complexity has recently been studied in an elegant work by Caputa et al\u00a0<cit.>. \nIt was argued that the K-complexity corresponds to the area of a certain region, using the Fubini-Study metric to define the metric of the operator space\u00a0<cit.>.\nCompared to such an inner product of operators, the physical meaning of C-complexity used here is more clear in quantum dynamics. \nWe find that it is more appropriate to interpret K-complexity as a length rather than an area. \nFurthermore, our approach applies to time-dependent Liouvillian\nsuperoperators, a largely unexplored problem in the study of K-complexity. \nAs we will show, it requires multiple K-complexity to fully describe the operator growth in the most generic case where Liouvillian\nsuperoperators are time-dependent.\n\nIn the operator space, the Heisenberg equation of motion is recast into a similar form as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\n\n    -i\u2202_t|\ud835\udcaa(t))=\u2112\u0302|\ud835\udcaa(t)).\n\nwhere the Liouvillian superoperator becomes \u2112\u0302=\u0124\u2297\ud835\udd40\u0302-\ud835\udd40\u0302\u2297\u0124^T.\nWhen a dynamical symmetry exists, this equation has simple analytical solutions. \nFor instance, when \u2112\u0302 is written as \u2112\u0302=B\ud835\udcae\u0302_x,\n\n    \ud835\udcae\u0302_x=\u2211_n=0^2\u2113-1 b_n|\ud835\udcaa_n+1)(\ud835\udcaa_n|+ h.c.\n\nwhere b_n= \u221a((n+1)(2\u2113-n)), 2\u2113 is an integer denoting the total number of Krylov basis states, and B is a constant. \nOne can define \ud835\udcae\u0302^+=\u2211_n b_n|\ud835\udcaa_n+1)(\ud835\udcaa_n| and \ud835\udcae\u0302^-=\u2211_n b_n|\ud835\udcaa_n)(\ud835\udcaa_n+1|. \ud835\udca6\u0302_\ud835\udcaa and \ud835\udcae\u0302^\u00b1 provide three generators of SU(2), as recognized by Caputa et al\u00a0<cit.>. \n\n    [\ud835\udca6\u0302_\ud835\udcaa,\ud835\udcae\u0302^\u00b1]=\u00b1\ud835\udcae\u0302^\u00b1,   [\ud835\udcae\u0302^+,\ud835\udcae\u0302^-]=2(\ud835\udca6\u0302_\ud835\udcaa-\u2113).\n\nThis dynamical symmetry can be easily seen by noting that Eq.(<ref>) corresponds to the spin operator \ud835\udcae\u0302_x of a total spin-\u2113, \ud835\udcae\u0302_y=(\ud835\udcae\u0302^+-\ud835\udcae\u0302^-)/(2 i) and \ud835\udcae\u0302_z=\ud835\udca6\u0302_\ud835\udcaa-\u2113, and the constant B corresponds to the strength of the magnetic field acting on the spin. Eq.(<ref>) thus can be viewed as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a spin-\u2113 subject to a constant magnetic field in the x-direction. Alternatively,  \u03d5(t) in Eq.(<ref>) can be regarded as the time-dependent wavefunction in a lattice model where the tunneling amplitude is denoted by b_n.\n\nFor Liouvillians with dynamical symmetry, the propagator \n\ud835\udcb0\u0302=\ud835\udcafe^i\u222b\u2112\u0302dt, where \ud835\udcaf is the time-ordering operator, can be parameterized using the generators of the symmetry group in the same manner as the evolution of a quantum state. For SU(2), \n\n    \ud835\udcb0\u0302=e^i\u03c8\ud835\udcae\u0302_ze^i\u03b8\ud835\udcae\u0302_xe^i\u03c6\ud835\udcae\u0302_z.\n\nIt evolves the initial operator |\ud835\udcaa(0)) to a generalized coherent state |\ud835\udcaa(t))=\ud835\udcb0\u0302|\ud835\udcaa(0))=|\ud835\udc9e_\u03b8,\u03c6,\u03c8)\u00a0<cit.>. \nEq.(<ref>) allows us to define circuit complexity and its underlying geometry. \n\nIn the most generic case, the Liouvillian superoperator in Eq.\u00a0<ref> is given by \u2112\u0302=B_x\ud835\udcae\u0302_x+B_y\n\ud835\udcae\u0302_y+B_z\ud835\udcae\u0302_z. \nThe operator dynamics thus can be viewed as the evolution of a spin-\u2113 subject to a magnetic field B\u20d7(t)=(B_x, B_y, B_z). \nThe circuit complexity denotes the shortest time to reach a target state under the constraint that the strength of the magnetic field is fixed, i.e., |B\u20d7|=\u221a(B_x^2+B_y^2+B_z^2)\u2261 B\u00a0<cit.>. \nThis amounts to fixing the metric of the operator space \u00a0<cit.>,\n\n    ds^2=\u2113^2 dt^2(B_x^2+B_y^2+B_z^2).\n\nNoting that d\ud835\udcb0\u0302\ud835\udcb0\u0302^-1=i \u2112\u0302 dt, equations (<ref>)\nshows that d\u03b8, d\u03c8 and d\u03c6 are determined by B\u20d7. Using Tr(\u015c_i\u015c_j^\u2020)=\u03b4_i,j, B_i=x,y,z can be expressed in terms of \u03c8, \u03b8, \u03c6, d\u03c8, d\u03b8 and d\u03c6.\nIn the content of circuit complexity, it amounts to defining a cost function F^2=\u2113^2 Tr(d\ud835\udcb0\u0302\ud835\udcb0\u0302^-1(d\ud835\udcb0\u0302\ud835\udcb0\u0302^-1)^\u2020 )\u00a0<cit.>.\nSubstituting such expressions to Eq.(<ref>), we obtain the following metric\n\n    ds^2= \u2113^2(d\u03b8^2+d\u03c8^2+d\u03c6^2+2cos(\u03b8)d\u03c6 d\u03c8).\n\nThis is the metric of a 3-sphere. \n\nWe note that Eq.(<ref>) can be understood as an expansion of the coherent state using  |\ud835\udcaa_n), which plays the roles of eigenstates of \ud835\udcae\u0302_z in the usual spin problem.\nTo be explicit, \n\n    \u03d5_n(t)=e^-i\u2113 (\u03c6+\u03c8)cos^2\u2113(\u03b8/2)\u221a((2\u2113)!/n!(2\u2113-n)!)\u03bc^n,\n\nwhere \u03bc=itan(\u03b8/2)e^i\u03c8.\nAs such, \u03c6 controls the global phase, \u03c8 denotes the relative phase between \u03d5_n.\nAnd \u03b8 determines the amplitude distribution of |\u03d5_n|^2. \nVery often, two operators with the same global phase can be identified as the same one. \nAs such, the state C-complexity is defined as the minimum of C-complexity to the final state with different \u03c6 but the same \u03c8 and \u03b8. \nSince Eq.\u00a0<ref> is a quadratic form of d\u03c6, extremizing Eq.\u00a0<ref> by setting d\u03c6=-cos(\u03b8)d\u03c8 reduces a 3-sphere to a 2-sphere \n\n    ds^2= \u2113^2(d\u03b8^2+sin^2(\u03b8)d\u03c8^2).\n\nEach point on the 2-sphere is equivalent to a coherent state |\ud835\udc9e'_\u03b8,\u03c8)\u2261|\ud835\udc9e_\u03b8,\u03c8,0). \nSince the geodesics of a 2-sphere are big circles, the state C-complexity could be visualized as the length of the arc along a big circle connecting the initial and the final operators, or equivalently, the polar angle \u03b8, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. \n\nSince |\ud835\udc9e'_\u03b8,\u03c8) form an overcomplete basis, we could expand |\ud835\udcaa_n) using |\ud835\udc9e'_\u03b8,\u03c8),\n\n    |\ud835\udcaa_n)=2\u2113+1/4\u03c0\u222bsin(\u03b8) d\u03b8 d\u03c8 f_n(\u03b8,\u03c8)|\ud835\udc9e'_\u03b8,\u03c8),\n\nin the same manner as expanding the eigenstates of \ud835\udcae\u0302_z using spin coherent states, where |f_n(\u03b8,\u03c8)|^2=|\u03d5^*_n|^2_\u03c6=0 is centered around \u03b8_n=arccos(1-n/\u2113). \nThis is precisely the Husimi Q-representation of |\ud835\udcaa_n)(\ud835\udcaa_n| using the coherent state of operators\u00a0<cit.>.\nOn the 2-sphere, |\ud835\udcaa_0) and |\ud835\udcaa_2\u2113) are placed at the south and the north poles, respectively.   \nEach other |\ud835\udcaa_n\u2260 0) corresponds to a strip along a latitude with a finite width. \nThe projection of the strip to the z-axis is equally spaced and the height of the strip measured from the south pole linearly increases with n. \nIn other words, each |\ud835\udcaa_n) can be assigned a unique coordinate on the z-axis, n. \nThis is directly a consequence of the metric tensor in Eq.(<ref>). We conclude that once the metric of the operator space is fixed in the study of C-complexity, the distance between basis states in the Krylov space is uniquely determined. \n\nSince the weight of |\ud835\udcaa(t)) in |\ud835\udcaa_n) is given by |\u03d5_n(t)|^2, K-complexity defined in Eq.(<ref>) could be viewed as the height of |\ud835\udcaa(t)) measured from the south pole, in the same manner as the expectation value of \ud835\udcae\u0302_z of a spin. \nThis is the physical meaning of K-complexity in the geometric representation of C-complexity. For the dynamics generated by \u2112\u0302=B\ud835\udcae\u0302_x in Eq.(<ref>), the evolution of the operator is equivalent to a spin processing about the x-axis. \nThe state C-complexity, which equals the polar angle \u03b8, grows linearly as a function of time, C=\u2113\u03b8(t)=\u2113 Bt. \nK-complexity, the height of the final operator is equivalent to the average value of \ud835\udcae\u0302_z of a spin, C_K=\u2113-\u2113cos(B t). \n\nThe same discussions apply to SU(1,1), where b_n in Eq.\u00a0<ref> is replaced by \u221a((n+1)(2k+n)), and k is the Bargmann index, a counterpart of \u2113 in SU(2). \nThe state C-complexity could be visualized using a hyperbolic surface embedded in Minkowski space. \nAs shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(B), each point on the hyperbolic surface is an SU(1,1) coherent state in the operator space,\n\n    |C_\u03b8,\u03c8')=e^ik\u03c8/cosh^2k(\u03b8/2)\u2211_n \u221a(\u0393(2k+n)/\u0393(2k)n!)\u03bc\u0303^n|\ud835\udcaa_n)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0303=itanh(\u03b8/2)e^i\u03c8.\nC is the length of the arc connecting the initial and final operators on the hyperbolic surface and grows linearly as a function of time, C=kBt. The Krylov basis states again correspond to strips on this surface. \nOn the z-axis, |\ud835\udcaa_n) are equally spaced, and C_K is the height of the final operator measured from the initial operator placed at the bottom of the hyperbolic surface. \nWhen C-complexity grows linearly, the height of the final operator grows exponentially. \nThis provides a geometric interpretation of the exponentially growing K-complexity,\n\n    C_K(t)= kcosh(B t)-k.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe metric of operator space, for instance, the 2-sphere in Eq.(<ref>), depends on ds defined in Eq.(<ref>). \nIn the study of C-complexity, it is known that the metric of the operator space could  change if a different ds is used. \nPhysically, this originates from that it may be easier (or more difficult) to implement certain gates than others\u00a0<cit.>. \nFor instance, in SU(2), one may choose\n\n    ds^2=\u2113^2 dt^2(B_x^2+B_y^2+\u03bb^2B_z^2).\n\n\u03bb>1 (\u03bb<1)  means that it is more difficult (easier) to implement the gate in the z-direction \u2112\u0302_z. An alternative understanding is that one seeks the least time to access the target state under a different constraint. \nThe new choice means that \u221a(B_x^2+B_y^2+\u03bb^2B_z^2) other than |B| is fixed. The metric of the operator space becomes \n\n    ds^2=   \u2113^2(d\u03b8^2+d\u03c8^2+d\u03c6^2+2cos(\u03b8)d\u03c6 d\u03c8)\n       +\u2113^2(\u03bb^2-1)(cos(\u03b8)d\u03c6+d\u03c8)^2.\n\nWhen \u03bb=1, it reduces to the previous result of a 3-sphere in Eq.(<ref>). \n\nThe state C-complexity is obtained by minimizing the above metric, \n\n    d\u03c6=-\u03bb^2cos(\u03b8)/1+(\u03bb^2-1)cos^2(\u03b8)d\u03c8.\n\nWe obtain \n\n    ds^2= \u2113^2(d\u03b8^2+\u03bb^2sin^2(\u03b8)/1+(\u03bb^2-1)cos^2(\u03b8)d\u03c8^2).\n\nWhen \u03bb=1, Eq.(<ref>) reduces to the previous result of a 2-sphere in Eq.(<ref>). \nWhen \u03bb\u2260 1, Eq.(<ref>) describes a deformed sphere, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>A. \nThe height of a point on the sphere with a polar angle \u03b8 measured from the south pole now becomes\n\n    h(\u03b8)=\u2113\u222b_0^\u03b8\u221a(1-cos^2(\u03b8')/(\u03bb^-2sin^2(\u03b8')+cos^2(\u03b8'))^3)d\u03b8'\n\nWhen \u03bb\u2260 1, the Krylov basis states |\ud835\udcaa_n) are no longer equally spaced. \nC_K(t) in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) needs to be modified such that it gives rise to the height of the final operator |\ud835\udcaa(t)),\n\n    C_K(t)=\u2211_n h(\u03b8_n) |\u03d5_n(t)|^2.\n\nAs a result, the time dependence of C_K changes, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>B. \n\n\n\n\n\nOur geometric approach also applies to time-dependent Liouvillian superoperators. \nThe simplest case is a quantum quench, where the dynamics is determined by \u2112\u0302 and \u2112\u0302' before and after t^*, respectively. \nFor instance, in the case of SU(2),  \u2112\u0302=B\ud835\udcae\u0302_x (\u2112\u0302'=B\ud835\udcae\u0302_z) when  t<t^* (t>t^*). \nThe trajectory on the 2-sphere is no longer along the longitude but the latitude when t>t^*. \nFor simplicity, we consider only undeformed spheres. \nThe generalization to \u03bb\u2260 1 is straightforward. \nThough the operator \ud835\udcaa(t) is still evolving, C_K remains a constant and thus cannot capture the quantum dynamics when t>t^*. \nThis can be simply seen from the definition of C_K in Eq.(<ref>), in which only the amplitude of \u03d5_n is included. \nNevertheless, the relative phase between \u03d5_n must be included, since the full dynamics happens on a 2-sphere and the polar angle \u03c8 of this 2-sphere is precisely the relative phase between \u03d5_n. \nState C-complexity C that fully exploits the metric of a 2-sphere can naturally capture the dynamics under an arbitrary time-dependent Liouvillian superoperator. \nFor instance, the shortest path connecting the initial and final operators in this quench dynamics is along another longitude, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>A. \nApparently, this path can be accessed using another time-independent Liouvillian superoperator \u2112\u0302\u201d=B\ud835\udcae\u0302_y.\n\nSince a single K-complexity is no longer sufficient when the Liouvillian superoperator is time-dependent, multiple K-complexity may be used. \nIn SU(2), we can define another set of Krylov basis states,\n\n    |\ud835\udcaa'_n)=e^-i\u03c0\ud835\udcae\u0302_y/2 |\ud835\udcaa_n),\n\nwhich play the same role as eigenstates of \ud835\udcae\u0302_x in a spin problem. \nOn the 2-sphere, |\ud835\udcaa'_n) corresponds to another set of strips, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>A. \nCorrespondingly, |\ud835\udcaa(t)) may be expanded using  |\ud835\udcaa'_n) as |\ud835\udcaa(t))=\u2211_n\u03d5'_n(t)|\ud835\udcaa'_n), and another K-complexity is defined C_K'=\u2211_n n|\u03d5'_n|^2.\nAs shown in Fig.<ref>B, when t<t^*, C_K increases with increasing t while C_K' remains unchanged. \nAfter t>t^*, whereas C_K stops growing, C_K' begins to change. \nAs such, at any time t, C_K and C_K' could jointly determine

\nSimilar results can be straightforwardly obtained for SU(1,1). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that K-complexity can be rigorously established from C-complexity in the presence of dynamical symmetry. \nOur method provides a clear geometrical picture and physical meaning of K-complexity. \nOur results can be generalized to other symmetry groups, which are expected to bring even richer physics bridging geometry and quantum information spreading in non-equilibrium dynamics.  \n\nQ.Z. acknowledges useful discussions with Pawel Caputa.\nThis work is supported by DOE
