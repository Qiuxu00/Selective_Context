Well-posedness of the discrete problems is proved. Higher order approximations inheriting most of the rich structure of solutions to the continuous problem on computationally feasible grids are naturally embedded. However, the block structure and solution of the algebraic systems become increasingly complex for these members of the families. We present and analyze a robust geometric multigrid (GMG) preconditioner for GMRES iterations. The GMG method uses a local Vanka-type smoother. Its action is defined in an exact mathematical way. Due to nonlocal coupling mechanisms of unknowns, the smoother is applied on patches of elements. This ensures the damping of error frequencies. In a sequence of numerical experiments, including a challenging three-dimensional benchmark of practical interest, the efficiency of the solver for STFEMs is illustrated and confirmed. Its parallel scalability is analyzed. Beyond this study of classical performance engineering, the solver's energy efficiency is investigated as an additional and emerging dimension in the design and tuning of algorithms and their implementation on the hardware.\n\n\nKeywords. \nPoro-/thermoelasticity, dynamic Biot model, space-time finite element approximation, geometric multigrid method, GMRES iterations, computational efficiency, energy consumption. \t\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Mathematical model\n\n\nWe present and investigate numerically a geometric multigrid preconditioning technique, based on a local Vanka-type smoother, for solving by GMRES iterations the linear systems that arise from space-time finite element discretizations of the coupled hyperbolic-parabolic system of dynamic poroelasticity\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\u2202_t^2 u\u20d7 - \u2207\u00b7(C\u20d7 \u03b5\u20d7(u\u20d7)) + \u03b1\u2207\u20d7p     = \u03c1f\u20d7 ,          in   \n\u03a9\u00d7(0,T] ,\n\n\nc_0\u2202_t p + \u03b1\u2207\u00b7\u2202_t u\u20d7  -  \u2207\u00b7(K\u20d7 \u2207p)      = g ,          in    \u03a9\u00d7(0,T] ,\n\n\nu\u20d7 (0) = u\u20d7_0 ,   \u2202_t u\u20d7 (0) = u\u20d7_1 ,   p(0)     = p_0 ,          in    \u03a9\u00d7{0}  ,\n\n\nu\u20d7     = u\u20d7_D ,          on    \u0393_u\u20d7^D \u00d7(0,T] ,\n\n\n-(C\u20d7\u03b5\u20d7(u\u20d7) - \u03b1pE\u20d7) n\u20d7      = t\u20d7_N ,           on    \u0393_u\u20d7^N \u00d7(0,T] ,\n\n\np     = p_D ,          on    \u0393_p^D \u00d7(0,T] ,\n\n\n- K\u20d7 \u2207p \u00b7n\u20d7      = p_N ,          on    \u0393_p^N \u00d7(0,T] .\n\n\nIn (<ref>), \u03a9\u2282^d, with d\u2208{2,3}, is an open bounded Lipschitz domain with outer unit normal vector n\u20d7 to the boundary \u2202\u03a9 and T>0 is the final time point. We let \u2202\u03a9 = \u0393_u\u20d7^D\u222a\u0393_u\u20d7^N and \u2202\u03a9 = \u0393_p^D\u222a\u0393_p^N with closed portions \u0393_u\u20d7^D and \u0393_p^D of non-zero measure. Important applications of the model (<ref>), that is studied as a prototype system, arise in poroelasticity; cf.\u00a0<cit.> and <cit.>. In poroelasticity, Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>) are referred to as the dynamic Biot model. The system (<ref>) is used to describe flow of a slightly compressible viscous fluid through a deformable porous matrix. The small deformations of the matrix are described by the Navier equations of linear elasticity, and the diffusive fluid flow is described by Duhamel\u2019s equation. The unknowns are the effective solid phase displacement u\u20d7 and the effective fluid pressure p. The quantity \u03b5\u20d7(u\u20d7):= (\u2207u\u20d7 + (\u2207u\u20d7)^\u22a4)/2 denotes the symmetrized gradient or strain tensor and E\u20d7\u2208^d,d is the identity matrix. Further, \u03c1 is the effective mass density, C\u20d7 is Gassmann\u2019s fourth order effective elasticity tensor, \u03b1 is Biot\u2019s pressure-storage coupling tensor, c_0 is the specific storage coefficient and K\u20d7 is the permeability field. For brevity, the positive quantities \u03c1>0, \u03b1>0 and c_0 >0 as well as the tensors C\u20d7 and K\u20d7 are assumed to be constant in space and time. The tensors C\u20d7 and K\u20d7 are assumed to be symmetric and positive definite,\n\n\n\n\n\u2203k_0>0   \u2200\u03be\u20d7= \u03be\u20d7^\u22a4\u2208^d,d:       \u2211_i,j,k,l=1^d \u03be_ij C_ijkl \u03be_kl \u2265k_0 \u2211_j,k=1^d |\u03be_jk|^2 ,\n\n\n \u2203k_1>0   \u2200\u03be\u20d7\u2208^d:        \u2211_i,j,=1^d \u03be_i K_ij \u03be_j \u2265k_1 \u2211_i=1^d |\u03be_i|^2 .\n\n\n In order to enhance physical realism in poroelasticity, generalizations of the model (<ref>) have been developed and investigated in, e.g., <cit.>. We note that the system (<ref>) is also formally equivalent to the classical coupled thermoelasticity system which describes the flow of heat through an elastic structure; cf.\u00a0<cit.> and <cit.>). In that context, p denotes the temperature, c_0 is the specific heat of the medium, and K\u20d7 is the conductivity. Then, the quantity \u03b1\u2207 p arises from the thermal stress in the structure, and the term \u03b1\u2207\u00b7\u2202_t u\u20d7 models the internal heating due to the dilation rate. Well-posedness of (<ref>) is ensured; cf., e.g., <cit.>. This can be shown by different mathematical techniques, by semigroup methods <cit.>, Rothe's method <cit.> and Picard's theorem <cit.>. In these works, boundary conditions different to the ones in (<ref>) to   (<ref>) are partly used. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Space-time finite element and multigrid techniques\n\n\nThe coupled hyperbolic-parabolic structure of the system (<ref>) of partial differential equations adds an additional facet of complexity onto its numerical simulation. A natural and promising approach for the numerical approximation of coupled systems is given by the application of space-time finite element methods that are based on an uniform treatment of the space and time variables by variational formulations. Therein, the discrete unknown functions are defined on the entire space-time domain \u03a9\u00d7 [0,T] and are represented in terms of basis functions. This facilitates the discretization of even complex coupling terms that may involve combinations of temporal and spatial derivatives as in (<ref>). Moreover, space-time finite element methods enable the natural construction of higher order members in the families of schemes. Higher order discretizations offer the potential to achieve accurate results on computationally feasible grids with a minimum of numerical costs. In particular for second-order hyperbolic problems, higher order time discretization schemes have shown their superiority, measured in terms of accuracy over temporal mesh resolution and compute time; cf., e.g., <cit.>. Finally, space-time adaptivity based on a-posteriori error control by duality concepts and multi-rate in time approaches become feasible. For this we refer to <cit.> for the presentation of the abstract framework of duality based error control and, e.g., to <cit.> for its application to physical problems. For the variational time discretization of second-order hyperbolic and parabolic equations, various families have been proposed and investigated recently; cf., e.g., <cit.>. They differ by the approximation order and regularity in time of the discrete solution as well as stability and energy conservation properties. In this work, we use a discontinuous Galerkin time discretization of arbitrary polynomial order and focus on the efficient solution of the resulting complex algebraic block systems. Higher order (variational) time discretizations for three-dimensional applications put a facet of complexity on the algebraic solver and have rarely been studied yet in the literature. For the discretization of the space variables, numerous finite element approaches have been proposed and studied, in particular, for the quasi-static Biot system of flow in deformable porous media. The latter model results from (<ref>) by neglecting the acceleration term \u03c1\u2202_t^2 u\u20d7 in (<ref>). For the quasi-static Biot model, three-field formulations with the fluid flux q\u20d7 = - K\u20d7\u2207 p as an additional explicit variable and the application of mixed finite element methods for the spatial discretization of p and q\u20d7 attracted strong interest of researchers; cf., e.g., <cit.> and the references therein. In this work, we use an approximation of the variables u\u20d7 and p by higher order inf-sup stable pairs of finite element spaces with continuous or discontinuous discrete variable p. Precisely, either the well-known Taylor\u2013Hood family of finite element pairs for u\u20d7 and p or a continuous approximation of u\u20d7 combined with a discontinuous approximation of p is used; cf.\u00a0(<ref>). In the literature, the latter option has shown its superiority for the approximation of incompressible viscous flow problems <cit.>. Structure-preserving approximations with the fluid flux and stress tensor as additional variables, that are based on a reformulation of the coupled problem (<ref>) as a first-order in space and time system (cf.\u00a0<cit.>), remain as a work for the future. \n\n\n\nIn our space-time finite element  approach, we choose a discontinuous temporal test basis such a time-marching process is obtained. On each subinterval I_n=(t_n-1,t_n] of the time mesh \u2133_\u03c4 := {I_1,\u2026, I_N}, we use a Lagrangian basis with respect to the (k+1) Gauss\u2013Radau quadrature points of I_n for the time interpolation. Two discrete systems differing by the treatment of the term \u2207\u00b7\u2202_t u\u20d7 in (<ref>) are then proposed. Dirichlet boundary conditions are implemented in a weak form by means of Nitsche's method and/or a discontinuous (spatial) approximation of the scalar variable p. Well-posedness of the discrete problems is carefully proved for arbitrary polynomial degrees of the discretization. The degrees of freedom on I_n are associated with the (k+1) Gauss\u2013Radau quadrature nodes of this subinterval; cf.\u00a0Fig. <ref>. On each subinterval I_n, the resulting algebraic problem is a linear system of equations with a block matrix of (k+1)\u00d7 (k+1) subsystems where each of the subsystems exhibits a complex structure itself. Here, k denotes the piecewise polynomial order of the time discretization; cf.\u00a0<cit.>. The solution of these algebraic problems with complex block structure demands for efficient and robust iteration schemes. Geometric multigrid (GMG) methods are known as the most efficient iterative techniques for the solution of large linear systems arising from the discretization of partial differential equations, particularly of elliptic type; cf. <cit.> for a general overview.  In contrast to other iterative solvers (like for instance BiCGStab or GMRES), multigrid solvers converge with a rate which is independent of the (spatial) mesh size and require computational costs that are only linearly dependent on the number of unknowns. Massively parallel implementations of GMG methods on modern architectures show excellent scalability properties and their high efficiency has been recognized, e.g., in <cit.>. Today they are widely used and are employed in many variants; cf. <cit.> for flow and saddle point problems. Nowadays, GMG methods are employed as preconditioner in Krylov subspace iterations, for instance GMRES iterations, to enhance their robustness, which is also done here.  Analyses of GMG methods (cf., e.g., <cit.>) have been done for linear systems in saddle point form, with matrix \ud835\udc9c\u20d7= [   A\u20d7 B\u20d7^\u22a4;   B\u20d7 - C\u20d7 ] and symmetric and positive definite submatrices A\u20d7 and C\u20d7, arising for instance from mixed discretizations of the Stokes problem. If higher order discontinuous Galerkin time stepping is used, the resulting linear system matrix is a (k+1)\u00d7 (k+1) block matrix with each of its blocks being of the form \ud835\udc9c\u20d7. This imposes an additional facet of complexity on the geometric multigrid preconditioner. To the best of our knowledge,  analyses of GMG methods arising form higher order (variational) time discretizations of the coupled system (<ref>) or related ones are still missing in the literature. \n\nGMG methods exploit different mesh levels of the underlying problem in order to reduce different frequencies of the error by employing a relatively cheap smoother on each grid level. Different iterative methods have been proposed in the literature as smoothing procedure; cf.\u00a0<cit.> and the references therein.  They range from low-cost methods like Richardson, Jacobi, and SOR applied to the normal equation of the linear system to  collective smoothers, that are based on the solution of small local problems. Here, we use a Vanka-type smoother <cit.> of the family of collective methods. Numerical computations show that an elementwise application of the Vanka smoother fails to reduce  the high frequencies of the error on the multigrid levels. The reason for this comes through spatial interelement couplings of degrees of freedom of the scalar variable p in (<ref>). This holds for the discontinuous and continuous spatial approximation of p. For the spatially continuous approximation of p, the coupling of degrees of freedom is obvious. For the spatially discontinuous approximation of p, the interelement coupling of degrees of freedom of p is due to the presence of the diffusion term in (<ref>) and the surface integrals involving averages and jumps of the discrete solution over interelement faces resulting from its discretization. This is in contrast to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations for which elementwise Vanka-type smoother are known to perform excellently if discontinuous pressure approximations are applied; cf. <cit.>. The difference comes through the fact that in case of the Navier\u2013Stokes system no interelement coupling of pressure degrees of freedom arises. As a remedy, we propose the application of the Vanka-type smoother on cell patches that are linked to the grid nodes and  built from four neighbored cells in two dimensions and eight neighbored elements in three dimensions, with appropriate adaptations for grid nodes close to or on the domain's boundary. Further we employ some relaxation strategy in the smoothing steps. Then an efficient damping of frequencies in the error on the multigrid hierarchy is obtained. Here, this Vanka-type smoother is presented in an mathematically exact way and its performance properties are investigated by numerical experiments. Our numerical experiments confirm that GMRES iterations that are preconditioned by the proposed multigrid method converge at a rate which is (nearly) independent of the mesh sizes in space and the time step size; cf. also <cit.>. In the smoothing steps, the application of the Vanka-type operator requires the solution of patchwise linear systems of equations. For (<ref>) and three space dimensions the size of the local systems no longer continues to remain negligible, in particular if a higher polynomial order in space and/or time is applied. Their solution deserves attention. In our approach we compute of inverse of the patchwise system matrix by LAPACK routines to solve to local system of equations. Details of an data-structure efficient MPI-based parallel implementation of the GMG algorithm in our in-house high-performance frontend solver for the deal.II finite element library <cit.> can be found in <cit.> where this is presented for the Navier\u2013Stokes system. Multi-field formulations of the system (<ref>), that are not studied in this work, further increase the complexity of the arising linear systems; cf.\u00a0<cit.>. However, the methodology of the linear solver, that is developed here, offers the potential of its generalization to more advanced problem formulations and their discretizations.  \n\n \n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Energy efficiency\n\n\nIn the past, performance engineering and hardware engineering for large scale simulations of physical phenomena have been eclipsed by the longing for ever more performance where faster seemed to be the only paradigm. \u201dClassical\u201d performance engineering has been applied to enhance, firstly, the efficiency of the current method on the target hardware or to find numerical alternatives that might better fit to the hardware in use and/or, secondly, to develop other numerical methods can be found to improve the numerical efficiency. Tuning both simultaneously is called hardware-oriented numerics in the literature; cf. <cit.>. Since recently, a growing awareness of energy consumption in computational science, particularly, in extreme scale computing with a view to exascale computing has raised; cf., e.g., <cit.>. It has been observed that as a consequence of decades of performance-centric hardware development there is a huge gap between pure performance and energy efficiency. An analysis of our algorithm's parallel scaling and energy consumption properties by performance models exceeds the scope of this work and would overburden it. However, since energy consumption of application codes on the available hardware is of growing awareness and a key for future improvements, we study the energy consumption and parallel scaling properties of our algorithm and its implementation by three-dimensional numerical experiments. The development of a proper model that quantifies performance and energy efficiency in some appropriate metric and can be used for a code optimization still deserves research and is left as a work for the future. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Outline of the work\n\n\nThis work is organized as follows. In Sec. <ref> we introduce our notation. In Sec. <ref> the space-time finite element approximation of arbitrary order of (<ref>) is derived and well-posedness of the fully discrete problem is proved. Our GMRES\u2013GMG solver is introduced in Sec. <ref>. In Sec. <ref> our performed numerical computations for analyzing the performance properties of the overall approach are presented. In Sec. <ref> we end with a summary and conclusions. In the appendix, supplementary results are summarized.     \n\n\n\n\u00a7 BASIC NOTATION\n\n\n\nIn this work, standard notation is used. We denote by H^1(\u03a9) the Sobolev space of L^2(\u03a9) functions with first-order weak derivatives in L^2(\u03a9). Further, H^-1(\u03a9) is the dual space of H^1_0(\u03a9), with the standard modification if the Dirichlet condition is prescribed on a part \u0393^D\u2282\u0393 of the boundary \u2202\u03a9 only; cf.\u00a0(<ref>). The latter is not explicitly borne out by the notation of H^-1(\u03a9). It is always clear from the context. For vector-valued functions we write those spaces bold. By \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9_S we denote the L^2(S) inner product for a domain S. For S=\u03a9, we simply write \u27e8\u00b7, \u00b7\u27e9. For the norms of the Sobolev spaces the notation is \n\n    \u00b7 := \u00b7_L^2 ,    \u00b7_1 := \u00b7_H^1 .\n \nFor short, we put \n\n    Q:=L^2(\u03a9)    and    V\u20d7:= (H^1(\u03a9))^d .\n\nFor a Banach space B, we let L^2(0,T;B) be the Bochner space of B-valued functions, equipped with its natural norm. For a subinterval J\u2286 [0,T], we will use the notation L^2(J;B) for the corresponding Bochner space. In what follows, the constant c is generic and indepedent of the size of the space and time meshes.\n\nFor the time discretization, we decompose the time interval I:=(0,T] into N subintervals I_n=(t_n-1,t_n], n=1,\u2026,N, where 0=t_0<t_1< \u22ef < t_N-1 < t_N = T such that I=\u22c3_n=1^N I_n. We put \u03c4 := max_n=1,\u2026, N\u03c4_n with \u03c4_n = t_n-t_n-1. Further, the set \u2133_\u03c4 := {I_1,\u2026,\nI_N} of time intervals is called the time mesh. For a Banach space B and any k\u2208_0, we let \n\n    \u2119_k(I_n;B) := {w_\u03c4 :    I_n \u2192 B  ,   w_\u03c4(t) = \u2211_j=0^k \n    \tW^j t^j  \u2200 t\u2208 I_n ,   W^j \u2208 B \u2200 j } .\n\nFor k\u2208_0 we define the space of piecewise polynomial functions in time with values in B by \n\n    Y_\u03c4^k (B) := {w_\u03c4: I\u2192 B  | w_\u03c4_|I_n\u2208\u2119_k(I_n;B) \u2200 I_n\u2208\u2133_\u03c4,  w_\u03c4(0)\u2208 B }\u2282 L^2(I;B) .\n\nFor any function w: I\u2192 B that is piecewise sufficiently smooth with respect to the time mesh \u2133_\u03c4, for instance for w\u2208 Y^k_\u03c4 (B), we define the right-hand sided and left-hand sided limit at a mesh point t_n by\n\n    w^+(t_n) := lim_t\u2192 t_n+0 w(t) ,  for  n<N ,\n    \t    and    \n    \tw^-(t_n) := lim_t\u2192 t_n-0 w(t) ,  for  n>0 .\n\nFor the integration in time of a discontinuous Galerkin approach it is natural to use the right-sided (k+1)-point Gauss\u2013Radau quadrature formula. On the subinterval I_n, it reads as \n\n    Q_n(w) := \u03c4_n/2\u2211_\u03bc=1^k+1\u03c9\u0302_\u03bc^GR w(t_n,\u03bc^GR ) \u2248\u222b_I_n w(t)  t  ,\n\nwhere t_n,\u03bc^GR=T_n(t\u0302_\u03bc^GR), for \u03bc = 1,\u2026,k+1, are the Gauss\u2013Radau quadrature  points on I_n and \u03c9\u0302_\u03bc^GR the corresponding weights. Here, T_n(t\u0302):=(t_n-1+t_n)/2 + (\u03c4_n/2)t\u0302 is the affine transformation from \u00ce = [-1,1] to I_n and t\u0302_\u03bc^GR are the Gauss\u2013Radau quadrature points on \u00ce. Formula (<ref>) is exact for all polynomials w\u2208\u2119_2k (I_n;).  In particular, there holds that t_n,k+1^GR=t_n.  \n\nFor the space discretization, let {\ud835\udcaf_l}_l=0^L be the decomposition on every multigrid level of \u03a9 into (open) quadrilaterals or hexahedrals, with \ud835\udcaf_l = {K_i| i=1,\u2026 , N^el_l}, for l=0,\u2026,L. These element types are chosen for our implementation (cf. Sec.\u00a0<ref>) that is based on the deal.II library <cit.>.  The finest partition is \ud835\udcaf_h=\ud835\udcaf_L. We assume that all the partitions {\ud835\udcaf_l}_l=0^L  are quasi-uniform with characteristic mesh size h_l and h_l=\u03b3 h_l-1, \u03b3\u2208 (0,1) and h_0 = \ud835\udcaa(1).  On the actual mesh level, the finite element spaces used for approximating the unknowns u\u20d7 and p of (<ref>) are of the form (l\u2208{0,\u2026,L})\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tV\u20d7_h_l^l     := {v\u20d7_h \u2208V\u20d7 \u2229C(\u03a9)^d  :   v\u20d7_h_|K\u2208V\u20d7(K)    for all  K \u2208\ud835\udcaf_l} , \n\n\t\t\n\t\tQ_h_l^l,cont     := {q\u20d7_h \u2208Q\u2229C(\u03a9)   :   q\u20d7_h_|K\u2208Q(K)    for all  K \u2208\ud835\udcaf_l} , \n\n\t\t\n\t\tQ_h_l^l,disc     := {q\u20d7_h \u2208Q  :   q\u20d7_h_|K\u2208Q(K)    for all  K \u2208\ud835\udcaf_l} .\n\t\n\nBy an abuse of notation, we skip the index l of the mesh level when it is clear from the context and put\n\n    V\u20d7_h := V\u20d7_h^l   and   Q_h := Q_h^l   with   Q_h^l\u2208{Q_h^l,cont, Q_h^l,disc} .\n\n For the local spaces V\u20d7(K) and Q(K) we employ mapped versions of the pairs \u211a_r^d/\u211a_r-1 and \u211a_r^d/\u2119_r-1^, for r\u2265 2. The pair \u211a_r^d/\u211a_r-1 with a (globally) continuous approximation of the scalar variable p in Q_h^l,cont is the well-known Taylor\u2013Hood family of finite element spaces. The pair \u211a_r^d/\u2119_r-1^ comprises a discontinuous approximation of p in the broken polynomial space Q_h^l,disc. For the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, the multigrid method has shown to work best for higher-order finite element spaces with discontinuous discrete pressure; cf. <cit.> and <cit.>. For a further discussion of mapped and unmapped versions of the pair  \u211a_r^d/\u2119_r-1^ we refer to <cit.>. For an analysis of stability properties of (spatial) discretizations for the quasi-static Biot system we refer to, e.g., <cit.>. In particular, both choices of the local finite element spaces, \u211a_r^d/\u211a_r-1 and \u211a_r^d/\u2119_r-1^, satisfy the inf\u2013sup stability condition,\n\t\n    inf_q_h \u2208 Q_h\\{0}sup_v\u20d7_h\u2208V\u20d7_h\\{0\u20d7}b(v\u20d7_h,q_h)v\u20d7_h _1   q_h\u2265\u03b2 > 0 ,\n\nfor some constant \u03b2 independent of h; cf.\u00a0<cit.>. In <cit.> optimal interpolation error estimates for mapped finite elements on quadrilaterals and hexahedra are studied. It turned out that the optimality is given for special families of triangulations. In two and three dimensions, families of meshes, which are obtained by a regular uniform refinement of an initial coarse grid, are among these special families. Such a regular refinement that is natural for the construction of the multigrid hierarchy is used in our computations.  Thus, for v\u20d7\u2208H\u20d7^r+1(\u03a9) and q\u2208  H^r(\u03a9) there exist approximations i_h v\u20d7\u2208V\u20d7_h and j_h q \u2208 Q_h such that, with some generic constant c>0 independent of h, \n\t\n    v\u20d7 - i_h v\u20d7 + h \u2207 (v\u20d7-i_h v\u20d7)\u2264 c h^r+1    and     q - j_h q\u2264 c  h^r .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SPACE-TIME FINITE ELEMENT APPROXIMATION\n\n\n\nFor the discretization we rewrite (<ref>) as a first-order in time system by introducing the new variable v\u20d7:= \u2202_t u\u20d7.

We employ discontinuous Galerkin methods (cf. <cit.>) for the discretization of the time variable and inf-sup stable pairs of finite elements (cf. Sec.\u00a0<ref>) for the approximation of the space variables in <ref>. The derivation of the discrete scheme, presented below in Problem\u00a0<ref>, is standard and not explicitly presented here. It follows the lines of <cit.>, where continuous in time Galerkin methods are applied to (<ref>), and <cit.>, where discontinuous in time Galerkin methods are used to discretize the Navier\u2013Stokes system. In contrast to <cit.>, Dirichlet boundary conditions are implemented here by Nitsche\u2019s method <cit.>. This yields a strong link between two different families of inf-stable finite element pairs for the space discretization. The main reason for using Nitsche\u2019s method here comes through our more general software framework. It captures problems on evolving domains solved on fixed computational background grids (cf.\u00a0<cit.>), where Nitsche\u2019s method is applied. We note that Nitsche\u2019s method does not perturb the convergence behavior of the space-time discretization; cf. Sec.\u00a0<ref>.\n\nFor the discrete scheme we need further notation.

The set of all faces (interior and boundary faces) on the multigrid level \ud835\udcaf_l is denoted by \u2131_h. In the second of the options in (<ref>), the parameter \u03b3 of the last term has to be chosen sufficiently large, such that discrete coercivity on Q_h of B_\u03b3 is preserved. The local length h_F is chosen as h_F =  h_F  := 1/2 (|K^+|_d + |K^-|_d) with Hausdorff measure |\u00b7 |_d; cf.\u00a0<cit.>.

Thus uniqueness of solutions to (<ref>) and, thereby, well-posedness of Problem <ref>  is thus ensured.\n\n\n\nIn Appendix\u00a0<ref> an alternative formulation for the system (<ref>) is still presented. It is based on using the time derivative \u2202_t u\u20d7_\u03c4,h of the primal variable u\u20d7_\u03c4,h instead of the auxiliary variable v\u20d7_\u03c4,h in (<ref>). In this case, an additional surface integral has to be included; cf.  Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) . \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ALGEBRAIC SOLVER BY GEOMETRIC MULTIGRID PRECONDITIONED GMRES ITERATIONS\n\n\n\nOn the algebraic level, the variational problem (<ref>) leads to linear systems of equations with complex block structure, in particular if higher order (piecewise) polynomial degrees k for the approximation of the temporal variable are involved.

For solving (<ref>) we consider using flexible GMRES iterations <cit.> that are preconditioned by a V-cycle geometric multigrid method (GMG) based on a local Vanka smoother. In <cit.>, the combined GMG\u2013GMRES approach is further embedded in a Newton iteration for solving space-time finite element discretizations of the Navier\u2013Stokes system. Thus, nonlinear extensions of the prototype model (<ref>) are expected to become feasible by our approach as well. \n\nTo derive the algebraic form of (<ref>), the discrete functions u\u20d7_\u03c4,h, v\u20d7_\u03c4,h and p_\u03c4,h are represented in a Lagrangian basis {\u03c7_n,m}_m=1^k+1\u2282\u2119_k(I_n;) with respect to the (k+1) Gauss\u2013Radau quadrature points of I_n, such that \n\n\n\n\tu\u20d7_\u03c4,h_|I_n(x\u20d7,t)     = \u2211_m=1^k+1 u\u20d7_n,m(x\u20d7) \u03c7_n,m(t) ,   v\u20d7_\u03c4,h_|I_n(x\u20d7,t) = \u2211_m=1^k+1 v\u20d7_n,m(x\u20d7) \u03c7_n,m(t) , \n  p_\u03c4,h_|I_n(x\u20d7,t)     = \u2211_m=1^k+1 p_n,m(x\u20d7) \u03c7_n,m(t) .\n\n\nThe resulting coefficient functions (u\u20d7_n,m,v\u20d7_n,m,p_n,m)\u2208V\u20d7_h\u00d7V\u20d7_h\u00d7 Q_h, for m=1,\u2026,k+1, are developed in terms of the finite element basis of V\u20d7_h and Q_h, respectively.

We solve the linear system (<ref>) for the unknown X\u20d7_n on the subinterval I_n by flexible GMRES iterations <cit.> that are preconditioned by a V-cycle geometric multigrid (GMG) algorithm <cit.>. Key ingredients of the GMRES\u2013GMG approach are \n\n\n  * left preconditioning of each GMRES iteration by a single V-cycle GMG iteration,\n\n  * prolongation to grids by interpolation and application of the transpose operator for restriction to grids,\n\n  * J_max pre- and post-smoothing steps on each grid level {\ud835\udcaf_l} for l=1,\u2026,L and\n\n  * application of a (parallel) direct solver on the coarsest mesh partition \ud835\udcaf_0.\n\nIn our computational studies presented in Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we use J_max=4 and the parallel direct solver SuperLU_DIST <cit.>. For the implementation of the restriction and prolongation operators the deal.II classes MultiGrid and MGTransferPrebuilt are used. For the deal.II finite element library we refer to <cit.>. For details of the parallel implementation by the message passing interface (MPI) protocol of our GMG approach  we refer to <cit.>.\n\nThe choice of the smoothing operator in the GMG method is extremely diverse; cf., e.g., <cit.> for a further discussion. We use a collective smoother of Vanka type that is based on the solution of small local problems. Compared to the Navier\u2013Stokes system <cit.>, the dynamic Biot problem (<ref>) requires adaptations in the construction of the local Vanka smoother. In inf-sup stable discretizations of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations by the \u211a_r^d/\u2119_r-1^disc, r\u2265 2, family of finite element spaces no coupling between the pressure degrees of freedom is involved due to the discontinuous approximation of the pressure variable. This feature leads to excellent performance properties of the Vanka smoother <cit.>. In contrast to this, the discretization (<ref>) of (<ref>) by \u2119_r-1^disc, r\u2265 2, elements involves a coupling between degrees of freedom of the scalar variable p due to the presence of the face integrals over the average and jump in the second of the options in (<ref>) for the definition of the bilinear form B_\u03b3. This coupling reduces the smoothing properties of elementwise Vanka operator. For the \u211a_r-1, r\u2265 2, family of elements for the scalar variable p, leading to the first of the options in (<ref>), the coupling of degrees of freedom of p by its continuous in space approximation and the loss of smoothing properties  arise likewise. As a remedy, for both families of inf-sup stable approximation in (<ref>) the local Vanka smoother is computed on overlapping patches of adjacent elements. In addition, an averaging of the patchwise updates is done after the Vanka smoother has been applied on all of them. \n\nTo construct the patchwise Vanka, we let on the mesh partition \ud835\udcaf_l, for l=1,\u2026, L, of the multigrid hierarchy the linear system, to be solved, be represented by\n\n    A\u20d7_l d\u20d7_l = b\u20d7_l ,   for    l=1,\u2026, L .\n\nTo each grid node \u03be\u20d7_l^m, for m = 1 ,\u2026 , M_l, where M_l denotes the total number of grid nodes on the mesh partition \ud835\udcaf_l,  we built a patch of adjacent elements such that \n\n    P_l^m := \u22c3{ K \u2208\ud835\udcaf_l |\u03be_l^m \u2208K} ,   for  m=1,\u2026, M_l  .\n\nIn two space dimensions P_l^m is built from four elements, if \u03be_l^m \u2209\u2202\u03a9. In three space dimensions, P_l^m has eight elements, if \u03be_l^m \u2209\u2202\u03a9.  If \u03be_l^m \u2208\u2202\u03a9, patches of less elements are obtained.  On \ud835\udcaf_l, let Z_l denote the index set of all global degrees of freedom with cardinality C_l,\n\n    C_l := card(Z_l) .\n\nLet Z_l(P_l^m) denote the subset of Z_l all global degrees of freedom linked to the patch P_l^m, i.e. degrees of freedom of u\u20d7_\u03c4,h, v\u20d7_\u03c4,h and p_\u03c4,h for the (k+1) Gauss\u2013Radau time points of I_n. The cardinality of Z_l(P_l^m) is denoted by C_l^m, \n\n    C_l^m : = card(Z_l(P_m^l)) ,   for   m=1,\u2026, M_l  .\n\nFurther, we denote the index set of all local degrees of freedom on P_l^m  by \u1e90_l(P_m^l) :={0,\u2026,C_l^m-1}. For the notation, we note that the set \u1e90_l(P_m^l) depends on the cardinality of the patch P_l^m. For a given patch P_l^m and a local degree of freedom with number \u03bc\u0302\u2208\u1e90_l(P_m^l) let the mapping \n\n    dof:\ud835\udcaf_l\u00d7\u1e90_l(P_m^l)  \u2192 Z_l ,     \u03bc = dof(P_l^m,\u03bc\u0302)\u2208 Z_l(P_l^m) ,\n\nyield the uniquely defined global number \u03bc\u2208 Z_l. Finally, we put R = dim V\u20d7_h and S = dim  Q_h. \n\nWe are now in a position to define the local Vanka operator for the patch P_l^m in an exact mathematical way; cf., e.g., <cit.>.\n[Patchwise Vanka smoother]\n\nOn patch P_l^m, for m\u2208{1,\u2026,M_l}, the local Vanka operator S\u20d7_P_l^m: ^(k+1)  \u00b7  (2R+S)\u2192^C^l_m is defined by  \n\n    S\u20d7_P_l^m(d\u20d7) = R\u20d7_ P_l^md\u20d7 + \u03c9 A\u20d7_P_l^m^-1 R\u20d7_P_l^m  (b\u20d7_l-A\u20d7_l d\u20d7) ,\n\nwith underrelaxation factor \u03c9>0 and  P_l^m-local restriction operator R\u20d7_K:^(k+1)\u00b7 (2R+S)\u2192^C_l^m defined by \n\n    (R\u20d7_P_l^md\u20d7)[\u03bc\u0302] = d\u20d7[dof(P_l^m,\u03bc\u0302)] ,   for  \u03bc\u0302\u2208\u1e90_l(P_l^m) .\n\nFurther, the patch system matrix A\u20d7_P_l^m\u2208^C_l^m,C_l^m in (<ref>) is defined by \n\n    A\u20d7_P_l^m[\u03bd\u0302][\u03bc\u0302] := A\u20d7[dof(P_l^m,\u03bd\u0302)][dof(P_l^m,\u03bc\u0302)] ,   for  \u03bd\u0302,\u03bc\u0302\u2208\u1e90_l(P_l^m) .\n\n\nIn the numerical experiments of Sec.\u00a0<ref> we choose \u03c9 = 0.7.  The P_l^m-local restriction operator (<ref>) assigns to a global defect vector d\u20d7\u2208^(k+1)\u00b7 (2R+S) the local block vector R\u20d7_K d\u20d7\u2208^C_l^m that contains all components of d\u20d7 that are associated with all degrees of freedom (for all (k+1) Gauss\u2013Radau points of I_n) belonging to the patch P_l^m.  For the computation of the inverse (A\u20d7_P_l^m)^-1 of the patch system matrixA\u20d7_P_l^m in (<ref>) we use LAPACK routines.\n\nThe application of the smoother for (<ref>) on the mesh partition \ud835\udcaf_l is summarized in Algorithm <ref>.  \n\n\n\nIn line <ref> of Alg.\u00a0<ref> the defect and solution vector is pre-initialized with 0\u20d7. In line <ref> the loop over all  J_max smoothing steps starts. In line <ref>  and <ref> the counter vector p\u20d7 for the number of updates of the degrees of freedom and the auxiliary vector z\u20d7  are initialized with 0\u20d7.\tIn line <ref> the loop over all patches P_l^m, for m=1,\u2026,M, starts. In line <ref> the local Vanka smoother is applied on patch P_l^m to the current iterate d\u20d7 of the defect vector and the image is stored in the local patch vector y\u20d7. In line  <ref> the local vector y\u20d7 is assigned to an auxiliary global  vector z\u20d7. In line <ref> the components of the counter p\u20d7 are incremented for the (global) indices associated with the degrees of freedom of the patch P_l^m processed in the loop. Finally, in line <ref> the arithmetic mean of the local (patchwise) updates z\u20d7 is assigned to the update of the global defect vector d\u20d7. In line <ref>, the P_l^m-dependent extension operator E\u20d7_P_l^m:^C_l^m\u2192^(k+1)\u00b7 (2R+S) is defined by \n\n    (E\u20d7_P_l^my\u20d7)[\u03bc] = {[                            y[\u03bc\u0302] , if \u2203\u03bc\u0302\u2208\u1e90_l(P_l^m): \u03bc = dof(K,\u03bc\u0302) ,;                                0 ,                 if \u03bc\u2209Z_l(P_l^m)  . ].\n\n\nRegarding the performance of Alg.\u00a0<ref> and the overall GMRES\u2013GMG approach we note the following. \n\n\n\n  * Averaging of the patchwise updates implemented in line <ref> and <ref> of Alg.\u00a0<ref>, that is used instead of overwriting successively the (global) degrees of freedom within the patch loop starting in line <ref>, is essential and ensures the convergence and efficiency of the local Vanka smoother and, thereby, the desired performance of the overall GMRES\u2013GMG linear solver. Without the averaging step we encountered convergence problems of the GMRES\u2013GMG solver for the experiments  of Sec.\u00a0<ref>.\n\n  * The same holds for the application of the Vanka smoother on the patches (<ref>) instead of using an elementwise Vanka smoother on the element K. The latter would lead to systems  (<ref>) of smaller dimension, however causes convergence problems for the GMRES\u2013GMG solver. This is expected to be due coupling of the degrees of freedom of the scalar variable p in the spatial discretizations used here,.  \n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 NUMERICAL STUDIES\n\n\n \nIn this section we study numerically the proposed space-time finite element and GMRES\u2013GMG solver approach with respect to its computational and energy efficiency. Firstly, we demonstrate the accuracy of solutions in terms of convergence rates. Further, we illustrate the robustness of the GMRES\u2013GMG solver with respect to the resolution in space and time and the polynomial approximation order. This is done for a challenging three-dimensional test problem of practical interest, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of large scale three-dimensional simulations. The numerical convergence of goal quantities of the benchmark is addressed. The parallel scaling properties of our implementation are also investigated. Beyond these studies of classical performance engineering, the energy efficiency of the approach is considered further.  \n\nThe implementation of the numerical scheme and the GMRES\u2013GMG solver was done in an in-house high-performance frontend solver for the  library <cit.>. For details of the parallel implementation of the geometric multigrid solver we refer to <cit.>. In all numerical experiments, the stopping criterion for the GMRES iterations is an absolute residual smaller than .\nThe computations were performed on a Linux cluster with 571 nodes, each of them with 2 CPUs and 36 cores per CPU. The CPUs are Intel Xeon Platinum 8360Y with a base frequency of 2.4, a maximum turbo frequency of 3.5 and a level 3 cache of 54. Each node has 252 of main memory.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Accuracy of the discretization:  Experimental order of convergence\n\n\n\t\nWe study (<ref>) for \u03a9=(0,1)^2 and I=(1,2] and the prescribed solution\n\n    u( x, t) = \u03d5( x, t)  E_2   and  \n    \tp( x, t) = \u03d5( x, t)   with  \u03d5( x, t) = sin(\u03c9_1 t^2) sin(\u03c9_2 x_1) sin(\u03c9_2 x_2)\n\nand \u03c9_1=\u03c9_2 = \u03c0. We put \u03c1=1.0, \u03b1=0.9, c_0=0.01 and K= E_2 with the identity E\u20d7_2\u2208^2,2. For the fourth order elasticity tensor C, isotropic material properties with Young's modulus E=100 and Poisson's ratio \u03bd=0.35, corresponding to the Lam\u00e9 parameters \u03bb = 86.4 and \u03bc = 37.0, are chosen.  For an experiment with larger values of \u03bb and \u03bc we refer to Table\u00a0<ref> in the appendix. In our numerical experiments, the norm of L^\u221e(I;L^2) is approximated by computing the function's maximum value in the Gauss quadrature nodes t_n,m of I_n, i.e., \n\n    w_L^\u221e(I;L^2)\u2248max{ w_|I_n(t_n,m)| m=1,\u2026 ,M ,   n=1,\u2026,N} ,   with   M=100  .\n\n\nWe study the space-time convergence behavior of the scheme (<ref>). For this, the domain \u03a9 is decomposed into a sequence of successively refined meshes of quadrilateral finite elements. The spatial and temporal mesh sizes are halved in each of the refinement steps. The step sizes of the coarsest space and time mesh are h_0=1/(2\u221a(2)) and \u03c4_0=0.1. We choose the polynomial degree k=2 and r=3, such that discrete solutions u\u20d7_\u03c4,h, v\u20d7_\u03c4\u2208 Y_\u03c4^2(V\u20d7_h), p_\u03c4,h\u2208 Y_\u03c4^2(Q_h) with local spaces \u211a_3^2/ P_2^disc are obtained, as well as k=3 and r=4 with u\u20d7_\u03c4,h, v\u20d7_\u03c4\u2208 Y_\u03c4^3(V\u20d7_h) and p_\u03c4,h\u2208 Y_\u03c4^3(Q_h) and local spaces \u211a_4^2/\u2119_3^disc ; cf. (<ref>), (<ref>) and (<ref>). The calculated errors and corresponding experimental orders of convergence are summarized in Table\u00a0<ref> and <ref>, respectively. The error is measured in the quantities associated with the energy of the system (<ref>); cf. <cit.> and <cit.>. Table\u00a0<ref> and <ref> nicely confirm the optimal rates of convergence with respect to the polynomial degrees in space and time of the overall approach. A notable difference in the convergence behavior between the pairs \u211a_r^2/\u2119_r-1^disc and \u211a_r^2/\u211a_r-1 of local spaces for the discretization of the spatial variables is not observed. For completeness, we summarize in Appendix\u00a0<ref> the convergence results obtained for the pair \u211a_r^2/\u211a_r-1 of spaces of the Taylor\u2013Hood family. A minor superiority of the pair \u211a_r^2/\u2119_r-1^disc over the pair \u211a_r^2/\u211a_r-1 is only seen in the approximation of the scalar variable p. The coincidence of the convergence results also holds for the application of Problem\u00a0<ref> instead of Problem\u00a0<ref>. The two discrete problems differ from each other by the discretization of the term \u03b1\u2207\u00b7\u2202_t u\u20d7 in (<ref>). \n\n\n\n\t\n\nNext, we show numerically that the time discretization is even superconvergent of order 2k+1 in the discrete time nodes t_n, for n=1,\u2026, N. For this, we introduce the time mesh dependent norm\n\n    w_l^\u221e(L^2) := max{ w(t_n)| n=1,\u2026, N} .\n\nWe prescribe the solution\n\n\t\n    u( x, t) =  \n    \t\t[ -2 (x-1)^2 x^2 (y-1) y (2 y-1) sin (\u03c9_1  t); -2 (x-1) x (2 x-1) (y-1)^2 y^2 sin (\u03c9_1  t) ]  and  \n    \t\tp( x, t) = -2 (x-1)^2 x^2 (y-1) y (2 y-1) sin (\u03c9_2  t)\n\n\nwith \u03c9_1=40\u00b7\u03c0 and \u03c9_2 = 10\u00b7\u03c0. We put \u03c1=1.0, \u03b1=0.9, c_0=0.01 and K= E_2 with the identity E\u20d7_2\u2208^2,2. For the elasticity tensor C, isotropic material properties with Young's modulus E=100 and Poisson's ratio \u03bd=0.35 are used. For the local spaces we choose the pair \u211a_5^2/\u211a_4 such that, for any t\u2208 [0,T], the solution (<ref>)   belongs to the discrete spaces V\u20d7_h and Q_h, respectively,  and its spatial approximation is exact. This simplification is done here since we aim to study the convergence of the temporal discretization only. In the experiment, we choose k=2 such that discrete solutions u\u20d7_\u03c4,h, v\u20d7_\u03c4\u2208 Y_\u03c4^2(V\u20d7_h) and p_\u03c4,h\u2208 X_\u03c4^2(Q_h) are obtained.\nWe use a spatial mesh that consists of 16 cells with h=1/(2\u221a(2)) and set \u03c4_0=0.02.\nThe calculated errors and corresponding experimental orders of convergence are summarized in Table\u00a0<ref>. Superconvergence of order 2k+1 in the discrete time nodes is clearly observed in the second of the tables in Table\u00a0<ref>. \n\n\t\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Computational efficiency:  Accuracy of goal quantities and convergence of the GMRES\u2013GMG solver in a 3d benchmark\n\n\n\nFor a three-dimensional problem configuration of practical interest (cf.\u00a0<cit.>), we study the potential of the proposed approach to compute reliably and efficiently goal quantities of physical interest that are defined in (<ref>). Concurrently, we analyze the convergence and performance properties of the GMRES\u2013GMG solver of Sec.\u00a0<ref> for our families of space-time finite element methods. More precisely, we consider the L-shaped domain \u03a9\u2282^3 sketched in Fig.\u00a0<ref> along with the boundary conditions for u\u20d7 prescribed on the different parts of \u2202\u03a9. Beyond the boundary conditions (<ref>) and (<ref>), we further apply (homogeneous) directional boundary conditions on parts of the boundary for the variable u\u20d7. This is done for the sake of physical realism. For the portion \u0393^d_u\u20d7\u2282\u2202\u03a9 they read as  \n\n    u\u20d7\u00b7n\u20d7 = 0     and      (\u03c3\u20d7(u\u20d7)n\u20d7) \u00b7t\u20d7_i  = 0 ,   for   i=1,\u2026, d-1 ,    on  \u0393^d_u\u20d7\u00d7 (0,T] ,\n\nfor the stress tensor \u03c3\u20d7(u\u20d7) = C\u20d7\u03b5\u20d7(u\u20d7) and the unit basis vectors t\u20d7_i, for i=1,\u2026,d-1, of the tangent space at x\u20d7\u2208\u0393^d_u\u20d7.  In the definition of A_\u03b3 in (<ref>) and (<ref>), the conditions (<ref>) still need to be implemented properly. For instance, for the left boundary of the L-shaped domain \u03a9 the first of the equations in (<ref>) implies that\n\n    u\u20d7_\u03c4,h\u00b7n\u20d7 = u_\u03c4,h,1 = 0 ,   for  u\u20d7_\u03c4,h=(u_\u03c4,h,1,u_\u03c4,h,2)^\u22a4 .\n\nBy the second of the conditions in (<ref>) we get for the second of the terms on the right-hand of (<ref>) that \n\n    \u27e8C\u20d7\u03b5(u\u20d7_\u03c4,h)n\u20d7, \u03c7\u20d7_\u03c4,h\u27e9_\u0393_u\u20d7^l  = \u27e8C\u20d7\u03b5(u\u20d7_\u03c4,h) n\u20d7\u00b7n\u20d7,n\u20d7\u00b7\u03c7\u20d7_\u03c4,h\u27e9_\u0393_u\u20d7^d .\n\nFor the boundary part \u0393^d_u\u20d7 we then put, similarly to (<ref>), \n\n    a^d_\u03b3 (w\u20d7,\u03c7\u20d7_h) := - \u27e8w\u20d7\u00b7n\u20d7, C\u20d7\u03b5(\u03c7\u20d7_h) n\u20d7\u00b7n\u20d7\u27e9_\u0393^d_u\u20d7 + \u03b3_a  h^-1\u27e8w\u20d7\u00b7n\u20d7, \u03c7\u20d7_h \u00b7n\u20d7\u27e9_\u0393^d_u\u20d7 ,\n\nwhile leaving a_\u03b3 unmodified for the part \u0393^D_u\u20d7 where Dirichlet boundary conditions are prescribed for u\u20d7. In its entirety, we thus have that a_\u03b3(\u00b7,\u00b7) := a_\u03b3^D (\u00b7,\u00b7)+a_\u03b3^d (\u00b7,\u00b7) with a_\u03b3^D (\u00b7,\u00b7) being defined by the right-hand side of (<ref>). By the arguments of Appendix\u00a0<ref>, the coercivity of the resulting form A_\u03b3 is still ensured. On the right boundary we prescribe a homogeneous Neumann condition for u\u20d7 with  t\u20d7_N=0\u20d7 in (<ref>). On the left part of the upper boundary, i.e. for \u0393^N_u\u20d7:=(0,0.5)\u00d7{1}\u00d7 (0,0.5),  we impose the traction force (cf. (<ref>))\n\n    t\u20d7_N = \n    \t[                                            0; 5 \u00b7 10^9\u00b7 (32 x z-18 x-16 z+10) sin (8 \u03c0  t);                                            0 ] .\n\nFor the scalar variable p we prescribe a homogeneous Dirichlet condition (<ref>) on the left upper part of \u2202\u03a9, i.e., for (x_1,x_2,x_3)\u2208\u0393_p^D:=[0,0.5]\u00d7{1}\u00d7 [0,0.5]. On \u0393_p^N:=\u2202\u03a9\\\u0393_p^D a homogeneous Neumann condition with p_N=0 in (<ref>) is prescribed. We put \u03c1=1.0, \u03b1=0.9, c_0=0.01 and K= E_3 with the identity E\u20d7_3\u2208^3,3. For the elasticity tensor C, isotropic material properties with Young's modulus E=20000 and Poisson's ratio \u03bd=0.3, that model the material behavior of human bone (cf. <cit.>), are used. We put T=4.\n\n\n\n\nAs goal quantities of this benchmark problem, we measure the displacement in the normal direction as well as the pressure at the right part of the boundary by \n\n    b_u\u20d7 = \u222b_\u0393_mu\u20d7\u00b7n\u20d7  o     and     \n    \tb_p = \u222b_\u0393_m p   o     for  \u0393_m:= {1}\u00d7 (0,0.5)\u00d7 (0,0.5) .\n \n\nThe time step size of the temporal discretization is chosen as \u03c4 = 0.01. The calculated profile for t=3.8 of the modulus of the vectorial variable u\u20d7 and the scalar variable p are illustrated in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. \nIn Table <ref> we summarize characteristic quantities and results of our simulations for various spatial resolutions and different temporal and spatial polynomial degrees of the STFEMs. In Fig.\u00a0<ref> we visualize the computed benchmark quantities (<ref>) of some of the simulations over the temporal axis. For the temporal discretization with polynomial degree k = 0 and k=1 the computed quantities differ on the spatial refinement level 4 only by a small shift of the phases of the goal quantifies. This indicates that for the current benchmark setting (choice of the model parameter and boundary conditions) the spatial discretization error dominates the temporal one. Therefore, in order to study numerically the convergence and accuracy of the goal quantities, we computed the benchmark problem for higher spatial resolutions (spatial mesh and approximation order; cf.\u00a0Table <ref>. The lowest row in Table <ref> contains the results of the finest simulation that we could run on our hardware. Fig.\u00a0<ref> shows that the solution (i.e., the goal quantities) is not fully converged yet. This underlines the complexity of the benchmark. The final column of Table <ref> shows the convergence statistics of the proposed GMRES\u2013GMG solver. In terms of the average number of iterations per time step the solver is (almost) grid independent. This underlines its capability and robustness for solving efficiently the complex systems arising from space-time finite element discretizations of partial differential equations.   \n\n\n\n\tscientific-notation = false,\n\t\tround-mode=places,\n\t\tround-precision=2,\n\t\toutput-exponent-marker=,\n\t\ttable-figures-integer=4, \n\t\ttable-figures-decimal=2, \n\t\ttable-figures-exponent=1, \n\t\ttable-sign-mantissa = false, \n\t\ttable-sign-exponent = false, \n\t\ttable-number-alignment=right \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Parallel scaling and energy efficiency\n\n\nHere, we study briefly the parallel scaling and energy efficiency of our solver. By studying energy consumption, we'd like to draw attention to this emerging dimension in the tuning of algorithms. Energy efficiency broadens the classical hardware-oriented numerics that is applied to enhance the performance of the current method on the target hardware and/or to find other numerical methods to improve the numerical efficiency. For the longer term, energy and power consumption needs to be mapped into a rigorous performance model. Here, we restrict ourselves to illustrate numerically the parallel scaling and energy consumption properties of our implementation that uses Message Passing Interface(MPI) libraries and multi threading parallelism. \n\nWe perform a strong scaling benchmark for the test problem of Subsec.\u00a0<ref> with k = 1, r = 2 and ref_n = 5, with 10571532 degrees of freedom in each subinterval I_n on the fine level \ud835\udcaf_L (cf. Table <ref>) and 98304 mesh cells on \ud835\udcaf_L. Throughout, we assign 18 MPI processes to each of the nodes used for the computations and vary the number n of nodes from n=20 to n=200. For the evaluation of the parallel scaling properties, we compute the parallel speedup of the code (cf.\u00a0<cit.>) that is approximated by\n\n    S = t_wall(n=n_min)/t_wall(n) ,\n\nwhere t_wall(n) denotes the wall time of the simulation of fixed size on n compute nodes and t_wall(n=n_min) is the wall time of the simulation on the minimum number of nodes involved in the scaling experiment. Secondly, we compute similarly the energy ratio by means of \n\n    R = E(n)/E(n=n_min) ,\n\nwhere E(n) measures the total energy consumption of the simulation on n nodes. The energy consumption is determined by the Linux cluster workload manager slurm <cit.>. The energy consumption data is collected from hardware sensors using Intel's Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) mechanism. It measures the energy consumption of the processor and memory.  On our system, the sampling interval of energy consumption is determined by the value of 30 seconds. Fig.\u00a0<ref> illustrates the results of the performance test.\n\n\n\nTo quantify and evaluate the productivity or resource costs of the algorithm and its implementation, we use a simple model for the Productivity P = Output O/Input  I; cf. <cit.>. In an economic sense, all outputs should be the desired ones. Therefore, we use the reciprocal of the wall time t_wall as the output O = 1/t_wall, such that a decrease in t_wall represents an increase of the (abstract) output. As the input I we use the total energy consumption E of the simulation. We scale the result by multiplying P with the constant factor E(n_min) \u00b7 t_wall(n_min) such that the computation with n = n_min has a productivity of P=1.0:\n\n    P = 1/t_wall(n)/E(n)\u00b7 E(n_min) \u00b7 t_wall(n_min) = S/R ,\n\nwith S and R being defined in (<ref>) and (<ref>), respectively. The resulting productivity curve of our computations is presented in Fig. <ref>. In our model the simulation on 80 compute nodes is the most productive one, that is, the ratio of output (low wall-time) to input (energy) is best. The characteristic quantities of our performance study are also summarized in Table\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tscientific-notation = false,\n\t\tround-mode=places,\n\t\tround-precision=2,\n\t\toutput-exponent-marker=,\n\t\ttable-figures-integer=3, \n\t\ttable-figures-decimal=3, \n\t\ttable-figures-exponent=0, \n\t\ttable-sign-mantissa = false, \n\t\ttable-sign-exponent = false, \n\t\ttable-number-alignment=right \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\n\n\nIn this work we presented and analyzed families of space-time finite element discretizations of the coupled hyperbolic-parabolic system (<ref>) of poro- or thermoelasticity. The time  discretization uses the discontinuous Galerkin method. The space discretization is based on inf-sup stable pairs of finite element spaces with continuous and discontinuous approximation of the scalar variable p. Well-posedness of the discrete problems is proved. For efficiently solving the arising algebraic systems with complex block structure in the case of increasing polynomial degrees of the time discretization a geometric multigrid preconditioner with a local Vanka smoother on patches of finite elements is proposed and studied. The overall approach is carefully evaluated for a sequence of numerical experiments, in particular for a challenging three-dimensional test setting of practical interest. Parallel scaling and energy consumption is also considered in the experiments. The benchmark problem of Subsec.\u00a0<ref> deserves further studies. In particular, soft materials with a dominating impact of the hyperbolic equation (<ref>) to the overall system  (<ref>) need to be studied as well. The definition of the goal quantities of the proposed benchmark might be reconsidered and revised with regard to either an improved choice of such quantities or their computation with higher rate of convergence. This evaluation remains as a work for the future. Finally, multi-field formulations of (<ref>) with an explicit approximation of the stress tensor \u03c3\u20d7= C\u20d7\u03b5\u20d7 and the flux vector q\u20d7=-K\u20d7\u2207 p might be advantageous for applications of (<ref>) in that these quantities are of interest or desired. By using the concept of the local (patchwise) Vanka smoother GMG preconditioner, that was presented here, multi-field formulations of (<ref>) are expected to be become feasible as well. This also remains as a work for the future. \n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n\nComputational resources (HPC-cluster HSUper) have been provided by the project hpc.bw, funded by dtec.bw \u2014 Digitalization and Technology Research Center of the Bundeswehr.\n\n99\n\t\nA67\t\nG.
