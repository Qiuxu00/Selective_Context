Rotational Brownian motion, as opposed to translational Brownian motion, is the phenomenon observed when a three-dimensional body is subject to random torques\u2014giving rise to a random trajectory on the group of rigid body rotations, SO(3). Despite the fact that research in this area commenced more than a century ago, rotational Brownian motion continues to be relevant in a variety of fields beyond soft matter and colloidal science, such as attitude estimation <cit.> and even exotic applications in astrophysics <cit.>. Debye had considered non-inertial rotational Brownian motion and Perrin <cit.> furthered this analysis by casting non-inertial rotational Brownian motion as a stochastic process on the rotation group SO(3).\n\nObtaining the joint orientation and angular velocity/momentum probability density for the inertial theory of rotational Brownian motion is a more challenging problem for arbitrary body geometries due to the presence of the nonlinear cross-product term in Euler's equations for rigid body motions. Many researchers have previously considered various approximations of the problem. Hubbard <cit.> for instance analyzed the rotational Brownian motion of spherical particles as dynamics evolving on the state space, SO(3)\u00d7 so(3). However, his analysis is approximate as well and he performed an iterative solution of the resulting Fokker-Planck equations rather than a direct exact solution. Fixman <cit.> considered the dynamics over phase space, SO(3) \u00d7 so^*(3), but his analysis is restricted to symmetric top-shaped particles. Finally, Coffey <cit.> considered Brownian motion in the phase space, i.e., SO(3)\u00d7 so^*(3) for needle-shaped particles but does not solve the Fokker-Planck equations directly. \n\nThere has also been some research in the context of obtaining marginalized versions of the joint probability densities, i.e., Hubbard <cit.> has also considered the probability distribution over angular velocity alone for arbitrarily shaped particles\u2014but the results are most accurate for small deviations from sphericity. Steele on the other hand <cit.> considers the probability distribution over orientation alone, but focuses primarily on a spherical particle. Ivanov <cit.> considers the probability distribution over orientation for arbitrarily shaped particles, with the Brownian motion process modeled as a random walk. \nFinally, Ford et. al., <cit.> derive orientational and angular velocity autocorrelation functions for asymmetric tops but assume that the viscous tensor and the inertia tensor are simultaneously diagonalizable; moreover, their expressions are derived by a perturbative expansion and are thus approximate. \nMoreover, they do not attempt to directly solve for the probability density function.\n\nThis paper considers the inertial rotational Brownian motion problem for an arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional rigid body, with no constraints on the structure of the viscosity tensor or moment of inertia. \nWe reformulate the inertial rotational Brownian motion as a stochastic process on the cotangent bundle group of SO(3).\nA small-time closed-form expression is derived for the probability density function (PDF) over orientation and angular momentum for the particle. \nThe parameters of the PDF are determined by an integration, which has an analytic expression in some cases and can be solved numerically in general.\n\n\n\n\u00a7  GOVERNING EQUATIONS\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Equations of Motion\n\nConsider a three-dimensional rigid body with the moment of inertia tensor I (in a body frame of reference). It is suspended in a fluid medium and at any point of time, its orientation is encoded by a three-dimensional rotation matrix, R\u2208 SO(3). The body frame angular velocity of the body is \u03c9_R\u2208\u211d^3 and defined such that \u03c9_R = (R^T\u1e58)^\u2228 where \u2228 is a bijection converting elements from the Lie algebra of SO(3) to \u211d^3 (in other words, vectorizes 3\u00d7 3 skew-symmetric matrices). The angular momentum of the body is then \u2113 = I\u03c9_R.\n\nThis body is subject to both a viscous torque that is proportional to the angular velocity of the body, i.e. of the form C\u03c9_R, as well as a random torque (in the context of Brownian motion, this arises from molecular collisions) \u03b7. The equation of motion is then the familiar Euler equation for angular momentum with random torque:\n\n    (\u2113\u0307 + I^-1\u2113\u00d7\u2113) = -CI^-1\u2113 + \u03b7.\n\nWriting this as a stochastic differential equation by noting that \u03b7 dt = B dW, where dW is a Wiener process increment with zero mean and variance dt, we have,\n\n    (\u2113\u0307 + I^-1\u2113\u00d7\u2113) dt = -CI^-1\u2113 dt + B dW.\n\nNote that B controls the variance and `color' of the noise term. \nIn the non-inertial theory, the cross-product term I^-1\u2113\u00d7\u2113 is assumed to be much smaller than the viscous torque CI^-1\u2113.\nThis is true when the viscosity of the fluid is relatively large and the particles are small.\nWe explain in Appendix I that these two terms can be of a comparable magnitude when the fluid is not viscous enough, e.g., in the air, where the inertial theory should apply.\n\nIn addition, since we are interested in obtaining the probability distribution over phase space (R,\u2113) we also have the following definition,\n\n    (R^T\u1e58)^\u2228 dt = I^-1\u2113 dt.\n\nSimultaneously solving (<ref>) and (<ref>) we obtain the joint distribution f(R,\u2113;t) on phase space. In the following section, we describe the geometry of this phase space.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Geometry of Phase Space\n\nFrom Hamiltonian dynamics, the phase space can be represented by the set of all orientation and angular momentum states that the body can occupy. We imbue an additional semi-direct product structure to this space so that we have a group SO(3)\u22c9\u211d^3 as the phase space on which the system evolves. From <cit.> we see that this is in fact the cotangent bundle group of SO(3). A group element, h(R,\u2113) \u2208 SO(3)\u22c9\u211d^3 is constructed as,\n\n    h(R,\u2113) = (\n        [ R^T   \u2113; 0^T   1 ]).\n\nNote that we parameterize rotations with R^T instead of R (nevertheless, this group is simply a different parameterization of SE(3)).\n\nThe Lie algebra of SO(3)\u22c9\u211d^3 is six-dimensional, and can be expressed using the same orthonormal basis as se(3):\n\n    \u1ebc_1 =\n        [  0  0  0  0;  0  0 -1  0;  0  1  0  0;  0  0  0  0 ],\n          \u1ebc_2 =\n        [  0  0  1  0;  0  0  0  0; -1  0  0  0;  0  0  0  0 ],\n\n\n    \u1ebc_3 =\n        [  0 -1  0  0;  1  0  0  0;  0  0  0  0;  0  0  0  0 ],\n          \u1ebc_4 =\n        [ 0 0 0 1; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 ],\n\n\n    \u1ebc_5 =\n        [ 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 1; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 ]  and  \u1ebc_6 =\n        [ 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 1; 0 0 0 0 ].\n\nThe adjoint matrix of the group is [Ad(h)] and is given by,\n\n    [Ad(h)] = \n        [  R^T    \ud835\udd46; LR^T  R^T ],\n\nwhere L^\u2228 = \u2113. Moreover, the \u201clittle ad\" operator is given by [ad(X)] where X is in the Lie algebra of SO(3)\u22c9\u211d^3. If,\n\n    X = \n        [   \u03a9   v; 0^T   0 ],\n\nthen for V^\u2228 = v,\n\n    [ad(X)] = \n        [ \u03a9 \ud835\udd46; V \u03a9 ].\n\nThe right and left Jacobians, \ud835\udca5_L and \ud835\udca5_R can be calculated as,\n\n    \ud835\udca5_r = \n        [ J_r(R^T)        \ud835\udd46;        \ud835\udd46        R ]  and  \ud835\udca5_l = \n        [  J_l(R^T)         \ud835\udd46; LJ_l(R^T)         \ud835\udd40 ],\n\nwhere J_r and J_l are the right and left Jacobians for SO(3) given as,\n\n    J_r(R(q)) = [(R^T\u2202 R/\u2202 q_1)^\u2228,\u22ef,(R^T\u2202 R/\u2202 q_3)^\u2228],\n\n\n    J_l(R(q)) = [(\u2202 R/\u2202 q_1 R^T)^\u2228,\u22ef,(\u2202 R/\u2202 q_3R^T)^\u2228].\n\nUsing the definitions for the left and right Jacobians, we can construct the left and right Lie derivatives for this group (where the summation is implied over repeated indices),\n\n    \u1ebc^R_i u(h(q,\u2113))    = \n    \n    E^L_i u(h(q,\u2113))  (i, j = 1, 2, 3)\n    \n    \n    R_(i-3),j\u2202\u0169/\u2202\u2113_j   (j = 1, 2, 3; i = 4, 5, 6)\n    \u1ebc^L_i u(h(q,\u2113))    = \n    \n    E^R_i u(h(q,\u2113)) - \u03b5_ijk\u2113_j\u2202\u0169/\u2202 l_k  (i,j,k = 1, 2, 3)\n    \n    \n    -\u2202\u0169/\u2202\u2113_i-3  (i = 4, 5, 6)\n\nwhere h is parameterized by q for the rotation and \u2113 for angular momentum and u(h(q,\u2113)) = \u0169(q,\u2113). Also, \u03b5_ijk is the Levi-Civita symbol. We use the formulae, E^R f = [J_r]^-T\u2202 u/\u2202q and E^L f = -[J_l]^-T\u2202 u/\u2202q, and, \u1ebc^R f = [\ud835\udca5_R]^-T\u2202 u/\u2202\u03be and \u1ebc^L f = -[\ud835\udca5_L]^-T\u2202 u/\u2202\u03be where \u03be = [q^T,\u2113^T]^T.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process in SO(3)\u22c9\u211d^3\n\n\nWe observe that the left-hand side of the equations of motion (<ref>,<ref>) can be written as a component of (\u1e23h^-1)^\u2228 dt where h is given in (<ref>). Since,\n\n    (\u1e23h^-1)^\u2228 =\n        [        \u1e58^TR -\u1e58^TR\u2113 + \u2113\u0307;         0^T           0 ]^\u2228.\n\nand (\u1e58^TR)^\u2228 = -(R^T\u1e58)^\u2228 = -\u03c9_R. This also implies that -\u1e58^TR\u2113 = \u03c9_R\u00d7\u2113 and we have,\n\n    (\u1e23h^-1)^\u2228 = \n        [       -\u03c9_R; \u2113\u0307 + \u03c9_R\u00d7\u2113 ].\n\nComparing with (<ref>,<ref>) we see that,\n\n    (\u1e23h^-1)^\u2228 dt = -\n        [  I^-1\u2113; CI^-1\u2113 ]  dt +\n        [ \ud835\udd46 \ud835\udd46; \ud835\udd46 B ]\u24c8 dw,\n\nwhich is a (left) stochastic differential equation evolving on SO(3)\u22c9\u211d^3; the \u24c8 makes it explicit that this is a Stratonovich equation. Notably, the troublesome cross-product term is absorbed into the definition of h, therefore, avoiding the need to deal with that term explicitly. Setting \n\n    m = \n    [  I^-1\u2113; CI^-1\u2113 ]  and  B\u0303 = \n    [ \ud835\udd46 \ud835\udd46; \ud835\udd46 B ],\n\nthe Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density function u(h,t) on SO(3)^T\u22c9\u211d^3 is,\n\n    \u2202 u/\u2202 t =- \u2211_i = 1^6 E^L_i(m_i u) + 1/2\u2211_i,j = 1^6 (B\u0303B\u0303^T)_ijE^L_iE^L_j u.\n\nThe procedure to go from a stochastic differential equation evolving on a group to a corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is provided in detail in <cit.>. In coordinates \u03be = [q^T,\u2113^T]^T, we express the equation in terms of \u0169(\u03be,t) = u(h(\u03be),t) as,\n\n    \u2202\u0169/\u2202 t = -\u2211_i,j = 1^6 Q_ij\u1ebc^L_i(\u03be_j \u0169) + 1/2\u2211_i,j = 1^6 (B\u0303B\u0303^T)_ij\u1ebc^L_i\u1ebc^L_j \u0169,\n\nwhere Q is,\n\n    Q = \n        [     \ud835\udd46  I^-1;     \ud835\udd46 CI^-1 ],\n\ntherefore describing a degenerate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The matrix Q has a maximum rank of 3, and therefore only 3 non-zero singular values.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Maxwell-Boltzmann Limit\n\nThe limiting distribution at t\u2192\u221e is a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for angular momentum and a uniform distribution over orientation, i.e.,\n\n    u_\u221e(R,\u2113) = 1/Zexp(-1/2\u03b2\u2113^TI^-1\u2113),\n\nwhich is known from thermodynamics. Here, \u03b2 = 1/k_BT where k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and Z is the partition function to normalize the distribution over phase space. To ensure that this limiting distribution can be obtained we also need,\n\n    C+C^T = \u03b2 BB^T,\n\nby the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. \nA proof using a non-parametric approach is provided in Appendix II.\nFor usual physical systems, this reduces to,\n\n    2C = \u03b2 BB^T,\n\nbecause C is a symmetric matrix as per Onsager's reciprocity theorem <cit.>. \nNote that a similar relationship between a diffusion matrix and viscous matrix is derived in <cit.>.\nHowever, their diffusion matrix D_0 has a different physical meaning from the BB^T we are using here.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SOLUTION METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS\n\nTo approximately solve the Fokker-Planck equation in (<ref>) we adapt the solution provided by Riksen in <cit.>. We consider the initial conditions of \u0169(h,0) = \u03b4_G(h) where \u03b4_G(h) is the group Dirac delta function concentrated at the identity element (this implies that the particle has zero angular velocity at t = 0 and all orientations are defined with respect to the orientation at t = 0). If the probability distribution is sufficiently concentrated we can make the following approximation,\n\n    \u1ebc^L_i \u2248 - \u2202/\u2202\u03be_i,\n\nso that we have u(h,t) = \u0169(\u03be,t) for sufficiently small time t,\n\n    \u2202\u0169/\u2202 t = \u2211_i,j = 1^6 Q_ij\u2202/\u2202\u03be_i(\u03be_j \u0169) + 1/2\u2211_i,j = 1^6 (B\u0303B\u0303^T)_ij\u2202^2\u0169/\u2202\u03be_i\u2202\u03be_j,\n\nwhich solves to yield a Gaussian with mean \u03bc(t) = 0 and covariance \u03a3(t) that varies as,\n\n    \u03a3(t) = \u222b_0^t [e^-Q\u03c4]B\u0303B\u0303^T[e^-Q\u03c4]^T d\u03c4.\n\nAssuming that this is the solution on the Lie algebra we can construct the solution on the group as,\n\n    u(h,t) =1/(2\u03c0)^3|det \u03a3(t)|^1/2exp(-1/2[log^\u2228 h]^T \u03a3^-1(t)[log^\u2228 h]),\n\nwhere log is the matrix logarithm. Hence, we obtain a closed-form approximate solution for the joint probability distribution evolving in phase space. We also note that the group theoretic mean and covariance are defined as,\n\n    \u222b_G log^\u2228(h \u2218\u03bc^-1) u(h,t) dh  \u2250 0,\n\nand,\n\n    \u03a3(t)  \u2250 \u222b_G [log^\u2228(h \u2218\u03bc^-1)][log^\u2228(h \u2218\u03bc^-1)]^T u(h,t) dh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Example: Diagonal and Isotropic Viscous Tensor\n\nConsider a body fixed frame that is oriented along the eigenvectors of the moment of inertia tensor I so that we have a diagonal moment of inertia tensor, I = diag(I_1,I_2,I_3). Then assume that the viscous tensor is of the form C = c\ud835\udd40 (i.e., diagonal and isotropic). The B\u0303 is also given as,\n\n    B\u0303 = \n        [  \ud835\udd46  \ud835\udd46;  \ud835\udd46 b\ud835\udd40 ],\n\nwhere 2c = \u03b2 b^2 from (<ref>). Then, \n\n    Q = [                       \ud835\udd46 diag(1/I_1,1/I_2,1/I_3);                       \ud835\udd46 diag(c/I_1,c/I_2,c/I_3) ],\n\nso that,\n\n    \u03a3(t) = \u222b_0^t [e^-Q\u03c4]B\u0303B\u0303^T[e^-Q\u03c4]^T d\u03c4\n    \n        = [ \u03c3_11(t) \u03c3_12(t); \u03c3_21(t) \u03c3_22(t) ],\n\nwhere,\n\n    \u03c3_11(t)    = b^2diag(\u03c3_11(I_1;t),\u03c3_11(I_2;t),\u03c3_11(I_3;t))\n    \u03c3_12(t)    = b^2diag(\u03c3_12(I_1;t),\u03c3_12(I_2;t),\u03c3_12(I_3;t))\n    \u03c3_21(t)    = b^2diag(\u03c3_21(I_1;t),\u03c3_21(I_2;t),\u03c3_21(I_3;t))\n    \u03c3_22(t)    = b^2diag(\u03c3_22(I_1;t),\u03c3_22(I_2;t),\u03c3_22(I_3;t)),\n\nsuch that,\n\n    \u03c3_11(I_i;t) = b^2/c^2(t - 3I_i/2c- I_i/2c(e^-2ct/I_i - 4e^-ct/I_i))\n       \u03c3_12(I_i;t) = \u03c3_21(I_i;t) = b^2/c(I_i/ce^-ct/I_i - I_i/2ce^-2ct/I_i - I_i/2c)\n       \u03c3_22(I_i;t) = -I_i b^2/2c(e^-2ct/I_i-1).\n\nWe see that when we set I_i = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, we obtain \u03c3_11(t) = b^2 t/c^2 and \u03c3_12(t) = \u03c3_21(t) = \u03c3_22(t) = 0. In fact, this is the solution obtained from a non-inertial theory as will be explored in the following section.\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Comparison against non-inertial theory\n\nIn the non-inertial theory of rotational Brownian motion, the governing stochastic differential equation is of the form,\n\n    C (R^T\u1e58)^\u2228 dt    = BdW.\n\nThis yields the following Fokker-Planck equation for u(R,t),\n\n    \u2202 u/\u2202 t =  1/2\u2211_i,j=1^3 D_ijE^R_iE^R_j u,\n\nfor D = C^-1BB^TC^-T, which is a drift-less diffusion on SO(3). If we consider the solution at small times (which can be approximated via covariance propagation <cit.>) and an initial condition of zero initial angular velocity, we obtain the following approximate solution:\n\n    u(R,t)    = 1/(2\u03c0)^3/2|Dt|^1/2exp(-1/2t[log^\u2228 R]^TD^-1[log^\u2228 R]).\n\nNoting that the covariance terms corresponding to the three-dimensional vector log^\u2228 R is \u03c3_11 from (<ref>), we proceed to make a comparison with the results from the theory of inertial rotational Brownian motion. \nNow, if B = b\ud835\udd40 is the identity matrix and C = c\ud835\udd40, this gives \u03a3 = Dt = b^2t/c^2\ud835\udd40. However, by setting I_1 = I_2 = I_3 = 0 in (<ref>), we obtain the same form for the orientational covariance \u03c3_11(t) from (<ref>).\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Spherical particles\n\nAs a special case, we consider a spherical particle, where I_1 = I_2 = I_3, to demonstrate the underlying ideas.\n\n\nAs ground truth, we compare against the covariance (the mean is always identity) obtained from an It\u00f4-Gangolli integration of the governing stochastic differential equation in (<ref>). That is, we evolve an ensemble of i = 1,\u22ef,N particles on the group with time as follows with the following update over a time step dt:\n\n    h_i(t + dt) = exp(dX)\u2218 h_i(t),\n\nwhere dX^\u2228 is the right-hand side of (<ref>). A probability distribution can be constructed from these sample points as,\n\n    u_s(h,t) = 1/N\u2211_i=1^N\u03b4(h\u2218 h_i^-1(t)),\n\nand the sample covariance is,\n\n    \u03a3_s(t) = 1/N\u2211_i=1^N[log^\u2228 h_i(t)][log^\u2228 h_i(t)]^T.\n\nThe above assumes that the sample mean is identity at all times. This is seen as a reasonable approximation since numerically, the sample mean deviates from the identity with only a 3% error (measured by a relative Frobenius norm) for N = 30,000 particles. \n\nIn what follows, we assume N = 30,000 particles and compare the covariance obtained from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck solution in (<ref>) with the sampled covariance for t = 3 units (and time step of dt = 1\u00d7 10^-3 units). Additionally, I = C = \ud835\udd40 and \u03b2 = 0.2 (the fluctuation-dissipation theorem sets the value of b = \u221a(2/\u03b2)). Furthermore, we decompose the 6\u00d76 covariance matrix into blocks of 3\u00d73 matrices as,\n\n    \u03a3 = \n        [   \u03a3_RR   \u03a3_R\u2113; \u03a3_R\u2113^T   \u03a3_\u2113\u2113 ],\n\nwhere \u03a3_RR and \u03a3_\u2113\u2113 are related to the covariance of the distribution once the distribution is marginalised over angular momenta and orientation respectively; \u03a3_R\u2113 is the covariance for the coupling of the two variables. \n\nThe error between the covariance matrix obtained from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck solution in (<ref>) and the sample covariance matrix is computed as,\n\n    Error(t) = ||\u03a3(t) - \u03a3_s(t)||_F/||\u03a3_s(t)||_F,\n\nwhere ||\u22ef||_F is the Frobenius norm. The evolution of this relative error with time is plotted in Figure <ref>. Notably, the error is small (order of 1%) till t\u2248 0.6 units after which the error grows monotonically, and the approximation is no longer valid. \n\n\nSince for a sphere, all three covariance matrices can be expected to be multiples of \ud835\udd40 (from (<ref>)), we now seek to compare the time-evolution for (co)variance \u03a3_RR, \u03a3_R\u2113 and \u03a3_\u2113\u2113; that is, for a covariance \u03a3 = k\ud835\udd40, we compare in terms of the scalar k.\nFor the sample covariance, we use the average of diagonal elements as k.\n\n\n  \nCovariance for orientations If the probability density for orientation for a non-inertial rotational Brownian motion is solved by covariance propagation, we obtain \u03a3_RR = tD\ud835\udd40 where D = b^2/c^2. \nWe also plot this solution along with that from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck approximation (for inertial theory). Finally, from Section <ref> we know that the limiting orientational distribution is a uniform distribution in SO(3), i.e., u_\u221e(R) = 1/(8\u03c0^2) so that we have,\n\n    \u222b_SO(3)1/8\u03c0^2 dg = 1/8\u03c0^2\u222b_0^2\u03c0\u222b_0^\u03c0\u222b_0^2\u03c0sin\u03b2 d\u03b1 d\u03b2 d\u03b3 = 1,\n\nwhere the integral over SO(3) is decomposed to an integral over the ZYZ Euler angles (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3). The limiting covariance is then,\n\n    \u03a3_RR,\u221e = 1/8\u03c0^2\u222b_G[log^\u2228 g][log^\u2228 g]^T dg.\n\nNow we parameterize g = g(q) in terms of exponential coordinates, i.e., g = exp(q^\u2227). In this parameterisation, \n    dg = 2(1 - cos||q||)/||q||^2 dq.\n Since q\u2208\u211d^3, we imagine decomposing the integral into an integration over a solid ball of radius r = ||q|| where 0\u2264 r < \u03c0. Then, letting the polar angle be \u03b8, for 0\u2264\u03b8 < \u03c0, and the azimuthal angle be \u03d5, for 0\u2264\u03d5 < 2\u03c0, we can write, q = [rcos\u03d5sin\u03b8,rsin\u03d5sin\u03b8,rcos\u03b8]^T. Thus,\n\n    \u03a3_RR,\u221e   = 1/8\u03c0^2\u222b_0^\u03c0\u222b_0^2\u03c0\u222b_0^\u03c0qq^T 2(1 - cos r)sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03d5 dr\n       = \u03c0^2 + 6/9\ud835\udd40.\n\nFigure <ref> is a plot comparing the (co)variance obtained from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck solution in (<ref>) along with the corresponding term in the sample covariance. Additionally, the covariance from the non-inertial theory and that for the limiting uniform distribution (<ref>) are plotted. \n\n\nWe note that the covariance from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck solution (<ref>) begins to deviate from the sample covariance after about t\u2248 0.6 units. Numerically, this is when the covariance becomes large enough that a distribution in the \u211d^3 space spanned by the exponential parameterisation of orientation has sufficiently large volume outside the solid ball, ||log^\u2228 g|| < \u03c0 for g \u2208 SO(3). The curvature of SO(3), therefore, makes the small covariance assumption that motivated the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck solution invalid. This is true even of the non-inertial theory in Figure <ref> and thus, none of the propagation or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck solutions are able to recover the limiting uniform distribution (corresponding to thermal equilibrium).\n\n\n\n  \nCovariance for orientation-angular momentum coupling Figure <ref> depicts the time evolution of the coupling covariance, comparing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck solution with the corresponding sample covariance.\n\nAt large times, the coupling (co)variance goes to zero, suggesting the decoupling between angular momentum and orientation, which is seen from the limiting Maxwell-Boltzmann solution in (<ref>).\n\n\n  \nCovariance for angular momentum In exponential coordinates, \n    log^\u2228 h = [          q; J_l^-1(q)\u2113 ],\n\nwhere J_l is the left Jacobian for SO(3) for exponential coordinates <cit.>. Thus \u03a3_\u2113\u2113 is taken to refer to the (co)variance associated with the vector y = J_l^-1(q)\u2113 instead. \nUsing the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and the definition (<ref>), we can obtain that the time limit covariance for y is \u03a3_\u2113\u2113,\u221e=\u03c0^2+3/9\u03b2 I.\nFigure <ref> depicts the time evolution for the covariance associated with angular momentum, comparing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck solution with the corresponding sample covariance and the time limit covariance.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWe have provided a short-time closed-form expression of the probability density function on the phase space for an arbitrary-shaped particle undergoing an inertial rotational Brownian motion.\nThe phase space is described by the cotangent bundle group of SO(3).\nAn example, where the parameters of the PDF have an analytic expression, is shown and compared to the ground truth and the approximate solution of the non-inertial theory.\nFor more general cases, it is possible to use a numerical method to obtain the parameters and utilize the simple closed-form PDF to perform further calculations.\n\nOne possible future work is to fit a spline to connect the small-time solution with the steady-state Boltzmann distribution.\nIt requires an additional estimation of the relaxation time.\nAnother extension is to calculate the covariance matrix without using the approximation (<ref>).\nA possible approach is to estimate the time derivative of the covariance matrix (<ref>) using the Fokker-Planck equation on phase space (<ref>) and the Lie derivative approximations in Appendix III.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by NUS Startup  grants A-0009059-02-00 and A-0009059-03-00, National Research Foundation, Singapore, under its Medium Sized Centre Programme - Centre for Advanced Robotics Technology Innovation (CARTIN),  sub award A-0009428-08-00, and AME Programmatic Fund Project MARIO A-0008449-01-00.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 APPENDIX I\n\n\nIn this section, we give a real-world example where the viscous torque is comparable to the torque introduced by inertia.\nThe modeling details and numerical results are presented.\n\nAssume many Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) particles are floating and rotating in the air subject to viscous torque and a random torque.\nA TMV particle is a long, stick-like particle, whose total length, inner, and outer diameter are 300 nm, 4 nm, and 18 nm respectively.\nIt is composed of coat proteins and a single-strand RNA molecule inside, with a total particle weight 3.94\u00d7 10^7 Da <cit.>.\nWe model a TMV particle as a solid ellipsoid with a major axis a=150 nm, two minor axes b=c=9 nm and mass M=3.94\u00d7 10^7   Da.\nThe viscous torque for a prolate ellipsoid is known <cit.>,\n\n    T^hyd=16/3\u03c0\u03b7 d^3  \u03c9 / [ 1/2lna+d/a-d-ad/b^2],\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the shear viscosity of the fluid and d=\u221a(a^2-b^2).\nThe inertia tensor of an ellipsoid is (when the frame is aligned with the principle axes):\n\n    I=M/5[ b^2+c^2       0       0;

Similarly,\n\n    E^R_iE^R_jx\u22481/2ad_j(e_i - 1/2ad_ix + 1/12ad_Xad_Xe_i) +\n    + 1/12E^R_i(ad_Xad_X)e_j\n\n\nThe following is true by the product rule:\n\n    E^L_iE^L_j(xx^T) = (E^L_iE^L_jx)x^T + E^L_jxE^L_ix^T +\n    + E^L_ixE^L_jx^T + x(E^L_iE^L_jx^T),\n\nwhere the E^L_ix term has to be expanded with an error of \ud835\udcaa(||x||^3) but E^L_iE^L_jx only needs to have an error of \ud835\udcaa(||x||^2) in the expressions in the paper (since it is usually multiplied with another quantity of order \ud835\udcaa(||x||)). Likewise,\n\n    E^R_iE^R_j(xx^T) = (E^R_iE^R_jx)x^T + E^R_jxE^R_ix^T +\n    + E^R_ixE^R_jx^T + x(E^R_iE^R_jx^T),\n\n\nThe previous two expressions rely on knowing E^L_iad_X and E^R_iad_X with an error of at most \ud835\udcaa(||x||^2). We first note that,\n\n    ad(c_1X + c_2Y) = c_1ad(X) + c_2ad(Y),\n\nby linearity for two constants c_1 and c_2. This can also be seen by assuming an arbitrary Z such that ad(c_1X + c_2Y)Z = [c_1X+c_2Y,Z] = c_1[X,Z] + c_2[Y,Z] = c_1ad(X)Z + c_2ad(Y)Z = (c_1ad(X) + c_2ad(Y))Z. Since this holds for any Z, the above identity follows. Then,\n\n    E^L_i(ad_X)    = lim_t\u2192 0([ad(log(e^-tE_i\u2218 k))] - [ad(log k)]/t) \n       \u2248 \n        -ad_i - 1/2ad_[E_i,X],\n\nand,\n\n    E^R_i(ad_X)    = lim_t\u2192 0([ad(log(k\u2218 e^tE_i))] - [ad(log k)]/t) \n       \u2248 \n        ad_i - 1/2ad_[E_i,X].\n\nUsing these results we have, to an error of \ud835\udcaa(||x||^3),\n\n    E^L_iE^L_jx\u22481/2ad_je_i + 1/4ad_jad_ix +\n    + 1/24ad_jad_Xad_Xe_i + 1/12(ad_iad_Xe_j + ad_Xad_ie_j)+\n    + 1/24(ad_[E_i,X]ad_Xe_j + ad_Xad_[E_i,X]e_j),\n\nand if we define P and S as the following collection of terms:\n\n    P = 1/2ad_je_ix^T + 1/4ad_jad_ixx^T +\n    +1/12(ad_iad_Xe_jx^T + ad_Xad_ie_jx^T),\n\n\n    S = e_ie_j^T + 1/2(e_ix^Tad_j^T + ad_ixe_j^T) +\n    + 1/4ad_ixx^Tad_j^T + 1/12(e_ie_j^Tad_X^Tad_X^T + ad_Xad_Xe_ie^T_j),\n\nwe would have,\n\n    E^L_iE^L_j(xx^T) \u2248 P + P^T + S + S^T.\n\n\n\n\n"}
