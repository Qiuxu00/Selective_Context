The number of multi-electron configurations scales exponentially with the number of MOs and is the primary bottleneck in calculating the energy of a many-electron system. This paper introduces qubitized Hamiltonian downfolding(QHD) by combining the techniques of qubitized quantum walks and Hamiltonian downfolding to reduce the active space dimension systematically. At each stage of QHD, the number of many-electron configurations is reduced by 1/4 by decoupling the molecular orbital (MO) farthest from the highest occupied MO (HOMO). The sequence of such downfolding steps enables us to scale towards the low-energy HOMO-LUMO window. For each stage of downfolding, we map the decoupling condition i.e., a many-body normal-ordered Bloch equation to a system of quadratic polynomial equations. These downfolding equations can be solved using the Levenberg-Marquadt Method (LMM). Each LMM step involves a Hessian inversion and comprises a quantum linear system problem(QLSP). We describe quantum circuits that block-encode the Hessian using qubitization oracles. Subsequently, we implement the Chebyshev expansion for Hessian inversion utilizing a sequence of qubitized quantum walks. Starting from an N-orbital system the gate complexity of each downfolding circuit scales as O(N^2log^2(1/\u03f5)) and for downfolding all the MOs involve O(N^3/\u03f5^2) oracle queries.\n\nHamiltonian Simulation Via Qubitized Downfolding Using 4log N+2 Qubits\n    Anirban Mukherjee\n    Accepted xxxx xxxxxx xx.

If we can calculate a chemically accurate potential energy surface(PES) with lesser computational time it has direct implication for Molecular dynamics or Monte-Carlo simulations.\n\nTo formulate the electronic problem, we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation: it allows the construction of the electronic Hamiltonian as a function of the nuclear coordinates. Both the one-electron and two-electron potentials namely h_ij and h_ijkl are N^2 and N^4 dimensional objects. The associated electronic Hamiltonian (H) is a massive object for N molecular orbitals that has a 2^2N\u00d7 2^2N matrix representation. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of H describe a many-electron system's static and dynamic properties. However, the computational complexity for eigenvalue decomposition of H scales exponentially with N. An alternate way to solve the problem would be to construct effective Hamiltonians from H that act on a reduced space of orbitals.\nThe effective Hamiltonian is a lower-dimensional representation of the full many-body Hamiltonian H, which describes the physics of a reduced subspace. Constructing an effective Hamiltonian is a central goal in physics, with applications in the study of quantum phase transitions<cit.>, quantum chemistry simulations <cit.>. The concept of effective Hamiltonian emerges in a diverse set of many-body methods: many-body perturbation theory<cit.>, Scheiffer-Wolff transformation<cit.>, similarity transformation<cit.>, continuous unitary transformations<cit.>, Hamiltonian truncation<cit.>, Feshbach-Lowdin-Fano method<cit.>, multireference perturbation theory<cit.>, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo<cit.>, Numerical renormalization group <cit.>, Hamiltonian downfolding<cit.>.\nAnother approach for estimating energy is the quantum phase estimation algorithm based on Qubitization<cit.>. The time evolution operator used in phase estimation e^iHT is reconstructed using quantum signal processing <cit.> starting from the Quantum walk operator e^iarccos(H/||H||_1), ||H||_1 is the 1-norm of the Hamilonian.  In <cit.>, the authors present an efficient way of representing the Hamiltonian in a quantum circuit using double factorization and tensor hypercontraction. It substantially reduces quantum resource usage compared to single factorization and quantum phase estimation. However, the number of physical qubits and Toffoli gates required is still very high. \n In this work, we sytematically decouple Molecular orbital by  Hamiltonian downfolding. The many body Bloch equation embodies every similarity downfolding transformation step. We derive a system of polynomial equations from the Bloch equations for downfolding one-molecular orbital. We describe Quantum Circuits to facilitate solving the algebraic equation, which helps us construct a lower dimensional Hamiltonian with one MO less every downfolding step. The entire process gets repeated for every orbital downfolding, leading to a smaller dimensional Hamiltonian.\n In the methods section, we will showcase the QHD (Fig<ref>)and the resulting multireference coupled cluster equations. Further, we will lay out the expressions for the systematic RG flow of the effective Hamiltonian. Each downfolding transformation gets generated from a similarity operation, and its parameters get determined from the\nBloch equation. The Bloch equation embodies decoupling the primary space from the secondary space. The major result of this work is the closed-form analytical expressions of the state-universal\nmultireference coupled cluster equations obtained from the Bloch equation. We show that the similarity transformation mapping\nthe chemical system of N molecular orbitals to N-1 molecular orbitals gets determined by solving a rectangular system of multivariate quadratic polynomials with m = O(n^2)\npolynomials and n=N(N-1) parameters. We present a method for solving this system\nof equations using LMM. We replace one of the costliest steps in LMM, i.e., inverting the Hessian with Chebyshev's approach<cit.> implemented using\nqubitized quantum walks. Finally, in the results section, we obtain scaling relations for the no. of qubits, gate complexity, and the number of queries required to solve the Multireference downfolding equations. \nSystem Description- We consider a system of N-correlated Hartree-Fock(HF) MOs corresponding to a chemical system. Then the fermionic Fock-space Hamiltonian in MO basis is represented as,\n\n    H=\u2211_ij\u03c3h^1,(N)_ijf^\u2020_i\u03c3f_j\u03c3+\u2211_ijkl\u03c3\u03c3'h^2,(N)_ijklf^\u2020_i\u03c3f^\u2020_j\u03c3'f_k\u03c3'f_l\u03c3,\n\nwhere h^1_ij is the one-electron tensors and h^2_ijkl is the two-electron interaction tensor. \u03c3=\u2191/\u2193 represents the up and down spin orbitals.Energy Level Grouping of the HF-MO's\nThe HF MOs get grouped into virtual orbitals \ud835\udcb1, core orbitals \ud835\udc9e, and active space orbitals \ud835\udc9c. We specify the absolute energy difference of the HF MO's (labeled k's) from the HOMO(highest occupied molecular orbital) energy E_HOMO as \u03f5_k=|E_i-E_HOMO|. The MO labels 1, 2, \u2026, N are ordered with reference to the absolute energy differences as  \u03f5_1\u2264\u03f5_2\u2264...\u2264\u03f5_N. If k\u2208\ud835\udcb1 then within Hartree-Fock theory the MO is unoccupied n_k\u2191+n_k\u2193=0. If k \u2208\ud835\udc9e then n_k\u2191+n_k\u2193=2. And if k \u2208\ud835\udc9c then n_k\u2191+n_k\u2193=0, 1, 2\nHamiltonian downfolding scheme-With the above orbital ordering per their H.F. energy reference, we set the stage for systematically downfolding MOs starting from the highest energy MO's scaling down towards the low energy HOMO-LUMO(lowest unoccupied Molecular orbital) window. For decoupling the outermost orbital N\u2208\ud835\udcb1 we partition the many-body Hilbert space \u210b^\u22972N into a primary space (P_(N)) and a secondary space (Q_(N)):\n\n    P_(N)   =   (1-n\u0302_N\u2191)(1-n\u0302_N\u2193)\n    \n    Q_(N)   =   n\u0302_N\u2191+n\u0302_N\u2193+n\u0302_N\u2191n\u0302_N\u2193\n\nHere n\u0302_k\u03c3=f^\u2020_k\u03c3f_k\u03c3. Together P_(N)+Q_(N)=I^\u2297 2N comprise the complete Hilbert space. We seek a similarity transformation S_(N)=exp(\u03b7_(N)) generated by \u03b7_(N) such that the Bloch equation is satisfied,\n\n    Q_(N)S^-1_(N),kHS_(N),kP_(N)   =   \u2211_j=1^mF_j(\ud835\udc21^(N),\ud835\udc2d^(N)):\u00ca_j:= 0\n\nHere :\u00ca_j: represents the normal ordered Fermionic excitation operators and F_j(\ud835\udc21^(N),\ud835\udc2d^(N)) represents the residuals. They comprise a vector \ud835\udc05^(N).\nIf the generator \u03b7_(N) satisfies the linearization condition Q_(N)\u03b7_(N)P_(N)=\u03b7_(N)  then a linear representation of the similarity transform S_(N)=1+\u03b7_(N)  can be obtained. We motivate a choice \nfor \u03b7_(N) from the terms within the Hamiltonian block Q_(N)HP_(N) eq.(<ref>) that carries electronic excitation's between spaces P_(N) and Q_(N),\n\n    \u03b7_(N)   =   \u2211_it^1,(N)_i(1-n\u0302_i-\u03c3)f^\u2020_N\u03c3f_i\u03c3\n       +   \u2211_ijt^2,(N)_ijf^\u2020_N\u2191f^\u2020_N\u2193f_i\u2193f_j\u2191\n\nThe generator comprises of the singles excitation amplitudes t^1,(N)_i and doubles excitation amplitudes t^2,(N)_ij. \nWith the form for \u03b7_(N) above, both the linearization condition and the size consistency and extensivity condition are satisfied. We replace the form for \u03b7_(N) eq.(<ref>) into the Bloch equation eq.(<ref>) and normal-order (N.O.) the expressions for the fermionic operators. \nFor the Bloch equation eq.(<ref>) to be satisfied, the coefficients of the independent N.O. fermionic terms must vanish: singles excitation-(i\u03c3\u2192 N\u03c3), doubles excitations-((k\u03c3,l\u03c3)\u2192 (j\u03c3', N\u03c3)), paired doubles excitations-((i\u2191,j\u2193)\u2192 (N\u2193, N\u2191)), triples excitations involving paired doubles((l'\u2191,k'\u2193,l\u03c3)\u2192(k\u03c3, N\u2193, N\u2191)).

There are m=n^2/2-n(N-2) polynomial equations of n=N(N-1) parameters. The system of m equations are partitioned into four parts (A-D); we define the individual number m_A,m_B,m_C,m_D below: The equation system \ud835\udc00(<ref>) comprises m_A=(N-1) elements, \ud835\udc01(<ref>) comprises m_B=1/2(N-1)^2(N-2) elements, \ud835\udc02(<ref>) comprises m_C=(N-1)^2 elements and eqs. \ud835\udc03(<ref>) comprises m_D=1/2(N-1)^3(N-2).\nHamiltonian RG flow from Downfolding\nThe similarity transformation S_(N) on the starting Hamiltonian H_(N)=H leads to a renormalized Hamiltonian H_(N-1) in the primary space P_(N) with a self-similar form,\n\n    H_(N-1)   =   P_(N)S^-1_(N)H_(N)S_(N)P_(N)\n       =   (1-n\u0302_N\u2191)(1-n\u0302_N\u2193)[\u2211_ij=1,\u03c3^N-1h^1,(N-1)_ijf^\u2020_i\u03c3f_j\u03c3\n       +   \u2211_ijkl=1,\n    \u03c3\u03c3'^N-1h^2,(N-1)_ijklf^\u2020_i\u03c3f^\u2020_j\u03c3'f_k\u03c3'f_l\u03c3]\n\nThe one and two-electron tensors comprising the renormalized Hamiltonian H_(N-1) are related to the bare one and two-electron tensors in eq(<ref>) and the amplitudes t^1,(N) and t^2,(N) of the generator(\u03b7) eq(<ref>) as follows:\n\n    h_ij^1,(N-1)   =   h^1,(N)_ij+h^1,(N)_iNt^1,(N)_j\n    \n    h^2,(N-1)_ijkl   =   h^2,(N)_ijkl+h^2,(N)_ijkNt^1,(N)_l+\u03b4_\u03c3',-\u03c3h^2,(N)_ijNNt^2,(N)_kl\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.\n\nThe effect of downfolding the electronic correlations coupling Q_(N) to P_(N) was to renormalize the one-electron eq.(<ref>) and two-electron interaction tensor contributions eq.(<ref>) in the primary space using the excitation amplitudes of the generator \u03b7 eq.(<ref>). From the RG flow equation of the Hamiltonian H_(N-1) (eq.(<ref>)) we make two important observation: first the indexes in the one and two-electron tensors (h^1,(N-1_ij, h^2,(N-1)_ijkl) runs over MO indices 1 to N-1 i.e. leaving out the Nth MO. The Nth orbital gets decoupled with only an overall diagonal contribution. This remains true even if N\u2208\ud835\udc9e  where P_(N)=n\u0302_\u2191n\u0302_\u2193 and for N\u2208\ud835\udc9c : P_(N)=n\u0302_\u2191n\u0302_\u2193 or (1-n\u0302_\u2191)(1-n\u0302_\u2193). However, in that case, the energetic contribution from the diagonal term may change. Second observation is that no new many-body excitation clusters are created. This results from the choice of \u03b7 where paired doubles at the Nth MO get excited t^2,(N)_ij. The choice of \u03b7 automatically terminates the hierarchy of the three-particle or higher-order clusters. Such a description allows the self-similar representation of the Hamiltonian to prevail. The next set of RG equations that describes the Hamiltonian coefficients for a system of N-2 MOs are derived from the N-1 MOs (<ref>), (<ref>). \nFlow towards diagonalization\nAfter s downfolding steps, we obtain a reduced Hamiltonian,\n\n    H_(s)   =   \u220f_a=N,\n    \u03c3=\u2191,\u2193^N-p(1-n\u0302_a\u03c3)\u220f_a=N-p-1,\n    \u03c3=\u2191,\u2193^N-s+1n\u0302_a\u03c3[\u2211_ij=1,\u03c3^N-sh^1,(N-s)_ijf^\u2020_i\u03c3f_j\u03c3\n       +   \u2211_ijkl=1,\n    \u03c3\u03c3'^N-sh^2,(N-s)_ijklf^\u2020_i\u03c3f^\u2020_j\u03c3'f_k\u03c3'f_l\u03c3]\u00a0\u00a0.\n\nAt the end of the RG flow, the ground state energy of the system and its electronic configuration can be directly read off from the Hamiltonian.\nTo obtain the excitation amplitudes used in the RG equation, we need to solve the Hamiltonian downfolding equations \ud835\udc00-\ud835\udc03((<ref>)-(<ref>)). Solving this system of equations is the computational bottleneck of this approach. In the next section, we describe the LMM for solving the downfolding equations.Quantum algorithm for solving the Bloch equation   \n \nWe search for the solution to the downfolding equations eq.(<ref>)-(<ref>) using the Levenberg-Marquadt Method (LMM).

With the above description of the LMM parameters, we find that the upper-bound of the total number of LMM iterations for the equations to converge with ||J_kF_k||<\u03f5 is N_Total=O(N^2/\u03f5^2C).\nHere C=f(\ud835\udc21^1_\ud835\udc0d,\ud835\udc21^2_\ud835\udc0d)g(\ud835\udc21^1_\ud835\udc0d,\ud835\udc21^2_\ud835\udc0d) is a scalar function of the vectors \ud835\udc21_1 and \ud835\udc21_2 its value will depend on the chemical system under study. Note that at every LMM step a n\u00d7 n Hessian matrix \u210d=(J_k^TJ_k+\u03bc_k)  needs to be inverted. The classical computational complexity of inverting the matrix scales as N_\u210d^-1=O(n^3)=O(N^6). \nFrom above we identify that calculating \u210d_k^-1 is the computational bottleneck of the LMM method. \nBlock-encoding the Hessian in an Oracle\nWe will implement a Quantum algorithm-the Child's Quantum walk approach<cit.> for matrix inversion using Chebysyev Polynomials.\n To make the calculation amenable for a quantum computing approach we first embed the Jacobian in a 2^D=m+n+pad dimensional system.\nThe operation B_J,   \n\n    B_J=[ I_n\u221a(\u03bc)       0       0;       J     I_m       0;       0       0   I_pad ]\n\nNote that in the embedding B_J of J, we have suppressed the k-index of the LM method for both the Jacobian J and the parameter \u03bc. The identity matrices are I_m, I_n, and I_p.We note that B_J is a d-sparse matrix where d=(n+1) as that is the maximum number of non-zero entries in a given row. Moving forward, we will implement a block-encoding framework for B_J and follow the procedure outlined for d-sparse matrices<cit.>. To the system of D/2=2log N qubits we add D/2+2 ancilla qubits(a's) |G\u27e9=|0\u27e9_a_1|0\u27e9_a_2|0\u27e9_a_3. Quantum registers a_1 and a_2 have one qubit each and quantum register a_3 involves D qubits. With this additional qubits we define the isometries (F_j is the set of column indices l\u2208 [d] with non-zero entries),    \n\n    T_1   =   \u2211_j=1^2^D\u2211_p\u2208 F_j\u00d4^1_j|j\u27e9_s|p\u27e9_a_3|0\u27e9_a_2|0\u27e9_a_1\u27e8 0|_a\u27e8 j|_s\u00a0,\n    \n    T_2   =   \u2211_k=1^2^D\u2211_p \u2208 F_k\u00d4^2_k|p\u27e9_s|k\u27e9_a_3|0\u27e9_a_2|0\u27e9_a_1\u27e8 0|_a\u27e8 k|_s\u00a0.\n\nThe oracles O^1_j and O^2_k are defined as,\n\n    \u00d4^1_j   =   \u2211_p\u2208 F_jI_s\u2297|p\u27e9_a_3\u27e8 p|_a_3\u2297 I_a_2\u2297 Y_a_1(\u03b8_pj)\u00a0,\n    \u00d4^2_k   =   \u2211_p\u2208 F_k|p\u27e9_s\u27e8 p|_s\u2297 I_a_3\u2297 Y_a_2(\u03b8_kp)\u2297 I_a_1,\n\nHere Y_a_1(\u03b8_pj)=e^iarccos(\u03b8_pj\u03c3^y_a_1) does Pauli Rotation about Y axis with \u03b8_pj=(B_J)_pj/d||B_J||_max . With the description of the isometries we can construct the unitary U_B_J=T_2^\u2020T_1 such that,\n\n    \u27e8 G|U_B_J|G\u27e9 = B_J/d||B_J||_max\n\nTo block-encode \u210d we now implement the oracle,\n\n    \u27e8 G|C_\u03a0Z U_B_J^TU_B_JC_\u03a0Z|G\u27e9   =   \u03a0_n B_J^TB_J\u03a0_n/(d||B_J||_max)^2\n       =   J_k^TJ_k+\u03bc_k/(d||B_J||_max)^2\n\nwhere \u03a0_n=[     I_n       0;       0 0_m+pad ]\u2297 I_2^\u2297 2 and C_\u03a0Z is a single-ancilla controlled-Z rotation \n\n    C_\u03a0Z=|0\u27e9\u27e8 0|\u2297 I_2^\u2297 (D+1)+|1\u27e9\u27e8 1|\u2297 (2\u03a0_n-I_2^\u2297 (D+1))\u00a0,\n\non the (D+2)-qubit space. After successful block-encoding, we discuss the scaling formulas for quantum resources required for downfolding in the next section.\nResults\nFirstly we talk about the quantum resources required for block-encoding the Hessian; then, we estimate the number of queries required for Child's quantum walk. From there, we obtain the gate complexity for matrix inversion. Finally, we discuss the number of LMM iterations needed for convergence. \nThe gate complexity needed to perform a (d||B_J||_max,D/2+2,\u03f5) block-encoding of \u210d is bounded by <cit.>,\n\n    N_\u210d   <   O(2log N+log^2.5(2N^2/\u03f5(\u210d)))\u00a0.\n\nNote in the above equation we have replaced the condition number \u03ba of \u210d by its upper-bound \u03ba<2/det(\u210d)<cit.>. The QLSP eq.(<ref>)(\u210d_kd^k(\ud835\udc2d_k)=J_k^T\ud835\udc05_k) can be solved by a Chebyshev expansion of (\u210d^-1)<cit.>. The Chebyshev polynomials are implemented by constructing qubitized quantum walks with the oracle C_\u03a0Z U_B_J^TU_B_JC_\u03a0Z. From <cit.> we  obtain the gate complexity for calculating (\u210d_k)^-1, \n\n    N_\u210d^-1< O(4N^2/det(\u210d)^2log ^2(N/det(\u210d)\u03f5))N_\u210d.\n\nNow we summarize our major result: to solve the downfolding equations for decoupling one molecular orbital, with accuracy \u03f5 for the LMM and \u03f5' for the Hessian inversion requires O(N/\u03f5^2) LMM queries to a qubitized quantum walk circuit with O(4log N) system+ancilla qubits. The Hessian matrix (\u210d) inversion circuit requires O(N^2/det(\u210d)log^2 (1/\u03f5)) gates to be implemented.\nAcknowledgement\u00a0The author would like to thank his collegeaus Vidyut Navelkar, CV Sridhar, Godfrey Claudin Matthias, Sayantan Pramanik, Ananthakrishna Gopal, Soumya Das, Sourav Chatterjee from TCS Incubation and Anil Sharma head of TCS incubation for their constructive feedback and support.
