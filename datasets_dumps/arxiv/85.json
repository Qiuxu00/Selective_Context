The analysis departs from a simple ballistic model of plasma electrons that allows us to derive a complete analytic solution for the pseudopotential and, consequently, for the wakefield. We demonstrate that the transverse plasma gradient modifies the bubble shape and affects the wakefield. Namely, the dipole plasma gradient results in a dipole component of the wakefield. Analysis suggests that, despite the asymmetry, the instability due to the fixed transverse plasma gradient is unlikely, as the total wakefield has a single stable point inside the bubble. The only effect that occurs is the shift of the electromagnetic center. We point out that random fluctuation of the transverse plasma gradient could become an issue.     \n\n\nEffects of the transversely nonuniform plasma density in a blowout regime of a plasma wakefield accelerator\n    S. S. Baturin\n    March 30, 2023\n===========================================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n\nBeam breakup (BBU) and emittance degradation are one of the main challenges on the way to the high luminosity collider based on a wakefield accelerator technology. <cit.>. Among others, <cit.> plasma-based wakefield accelerators (PWA) are considered the most promising candidate for the particle accelerators of the future  <cit.> as it possesses intrinsic focusing mechanism provided by the ions and extreme accelerating gradients at the same time <cit.>. In particular, in a so-called bubble regime, when plasma electrons are expelled, due to the high intensity of either laser or electron driver longitudinal (accelerating) electric field could be \u223c 50 GV/m <cit.>. Accelerating gradient is tightly connected with the transverse wakefield by the means of the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem <cit.>. When the longitudinal wake is axisymmetric, the transverse wake is zero, but even a tiny asymmetry is enough to seed the instability, that is caused by the transverse wake. The latter is connected with the fact that projected transverse beam emittance grows exponentially due to the BBU <cit.>. Moreover, even a short noise (a small random force or random asymmetry in the beam distribution) triggers the BBU.               \n\nDespite such a strong limitation, it tums out that BBU could still be controlled. Many mechanisms and approaches, including ion motion <cit.>, BNS damping <cit.>, and other methods of instability suppression have been investigated extensively. It was demonstrated that BBU is not just suppressed but eliminated in a certain parameter range.   \n\nIn the present study, we investigate how the local transverse asymmetry of the plasma gradient affects the wake and analyze these results from a beam dynamics perspective. The analysis is based on the ballistic model of the plasma electrons introduced in Ref.<cit.>. To an extent, present calculations echo the analysis of the Ref.<cit.>, where a flat bubble formation was investigated. In contrast to the Ref.<cit.>, where it was demonstrated that the wakefield is insensitive to the transverse plasma gradient, we show that in a commonly considered round bubble, transverse plasma gradient results in a transverse wake. Within the considered approximation we analyze plasma flow, derive an analytic expression for the pseudopotential, and provide a discussion of the possible consequences.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.<ref>, for the sake of convenience, we reproduce basic formulas and equations provided in Refs.<cit.> that we will use throughout the paper. In Sec.<ref> we derive the expression for the electromagnetic shock wave produced by the driver, and in Sec.<ref> we present an expression that describes the bubble shape within ballistic approximation. In Sec.<ref> plasma electron density is derived, and the outcome of this section is then used in Sec.<ref> to get to the main result of the paper - the expression for the pseudopotential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 BASIC EQUATIONS \n\n\n\n\nWe start from the set of equations derived in Ref.<cit.>.  We use the same convention as the Ref.<cit.> and we use dimensionless variables: time is normalized to \u03c9_p^-1, length to k_p^-1, \nvelocities to the speed of light c, and momenta to mc. We also normalize fields to mc\u03c9_p/e, forces to mc\u03c9_p, potentials to mc^2/e, the charge density to n_0 e, the plasma density to n_0, and the current density to en_0c. With e being the elementary charge, e>0.\n\nThe equation of motion for the plasma electrons could be written as \n\n    d\ud835\udc29/dt=\u2207\u03c8-\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc01,\u00a0d\ud835\udc2b/dt=\ud835\udc29/\u03b3.\n\nHere \ud835\udc29 is the momentum of the plasma electrons, \u03b3=\u221a(1+p^2) is the relativistic gamma factor of the plasma electrons, \ud835\udc2f=\ud835\udc29/\u03b3 is the velocity and \u03c8=\u03d5-A_z is the pseudopotential that defines the wake field as\n\n    E_z=\u2202\u03c8/\u2202\u03be, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\ud835\udc05_\u22a5=-\u2207_\u22a5\u03c8,\n\nand \u2207=(\u2202_x,\u2202_y,-\u2202_\u03be).\nHere \ud835\udc05_\u22a5 is the transverse part of the Lorentz force  per unit charge of the test particle and \u03be=t-z.\n\nEqs.(<ref>) have the following integral of motion\n\n    \u03b3-p_z-\u03c8=1,\n\nas a consequence we have \n\n    1-v_z=1+\u03c8/\u03b3.\n\nIn a quasi-static picture, it is convenient to replace the derivative by time t with the derivative by \u03be.\nWe use the fact that\n\n    d\u03be/dt=1-v_z,\n\nconsequently for an arbitrary function f(\u03be) we have.\n\n    df/dt=df/d\u03bed\u03be/dt=(1-v_z)df/d\u03be=1+\u03c8/\u03b3df/d\u03be.\n\nSince in the quasi-static picture momentum of the plasma electron is a function of \u03be Eqs.(<ref>) with Eq.(<ref>) are reduced to\n\n    d\ud835\udc29_\u22a5/d\u03be=\u03b3/1+\u03c8[\u2207_\u22a5\u03c8+\u1e91\ud835\udc01_\u22a5]-B_z/1+\u03c8\ud835\udc29_\u22a5\u1e91.\n\nEquation for the pseudopotential reads\n\n    \u0394_\u22a5\u03c8=(1-v_z)n_e-n_i(x),\n\n here n_e is the plasma electron density and n_i(x) is the ion density that depends on x. In what follows, we will assume that\n \n    n_i(x)\n         =\n         1+gx,\n\n with g\u226a 1.\n Equations for the magnetic field are \n \n    \u0394_\u22a5 B_z=\u1e91\u00b7(\u2207_\u22a5 n_e\ud835\udc2f_\u22a5), \n       \u0394_\u22a5\ud835\udc01_\u22a5=-\u1e91\u2207_\u22a5 n_e v_z-\u1e91\u2202_\u03be n_e \ud835\udc2f_\u22a5.\n\n\nThe continuity equation reads\n\n    _\u03be[n_e(1-v_z)]\n        +\n        \u2207_\u22a5\u00b7\n        n_ev\u20d7_\u22a5\n        =\n        0\n        .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SHOCK WAVE \n\n\n\n\nTo calculate the field distribution that is produced by the point driver that travels through plasma, we follow  Refs.<cit.>. Namely, we assume that driver fields are localized in an infinitesimally thin layer, i.e.  \nhave a delta-function discontinuity\n\n\n    \ud835\udc04_\u22a5   =\ud835\udc03\u03b4(\u03be), \n    \ud835\udc01_\u22a5   =\u1e91\u00d7\ud835\udc03\u03b4(\u03be).\n\n\nThe transverse profile of these fields is defined by the 2D vector \ud835\udc03.\n\nTo solve for the shock wave at \u03be=0, we assume that the plasma density in front of the moving driver has a linear gradient\n    \n    n_0\n            =\n            1 + gx\n            ,\n\nwhere the uniform part of the density is 1, g is a constant, and x is the transverse coordinate. We assume a small gradient,\n    \n    g\u226a 1\n            ,\n\nand use the perturbation theory.\n\nWe consider equation for the vector D\u20d7 that according to Ref.<cit.> reads\n\n    \u0394_\u22a5D\u20d7 =n_0/\u03b3_0D\u20d7.\n\nIf we split D\u20d7 into r and \u03d5 component then Eq.(<ref>) could be written in expanded form as\n\n    \u0394_\u22a5 D_r-D_r/r^2-2/r^2\u2202 D_\u03d5/\u2202\u03d5 =n_0/\u03b3_0 D_r, \n       \u0394_\u22a5 D_\u03d5-D_\u03d5/r^2+2/r^2\u2202 D_r/\u2202\u03d5 =n_0/\u03b3_0 D_\u03d5,\n\nwith the Laplace operator given by\n\n    \u0394_\u22a5=1/r\u2202/\u2202 r[r \u2202/\u2202 r]+1/r^2\u2202^2 /\u2202\u03d5^2.\n\nIf we assume that n_0 is a constant then due to the axial symmetry we have D\u20d7=D_r(r)r\u20d7 and D_\u03d5=0.\nThis immediately results in the equation for D(r) in a form\n\n    1/r\u2202/\u2202 r[r \u2202 D_r/\u2202 r]-1/r^2D_r =n_0/\u03b3_0 D_r.\n\nWith the unmodified plasma density, initial gamma set to unity (n_0=1, \u03b3_0=1) and boundary conditions D_r(\u221e)=0, D_r(r\u2192 0)=2\u03bd/r we have\n\n    D_r(r,\u03d5)=2\u03bd K_1(r).\n\nNext, we consider n_0 as given by Eq.(<ref>). We apply perturbation theory and seek a solution of the Eq.(<ref>) in a form\n\n    D_r=D_r^(0)+D_r^(1), \n       D_\u03d5=D_\u03d5^(0)+D_\u03d5^(1).\n\nWith the D_r^(0)=2\u03bd K_1(r), D_\u03d5^(0)=0 and D_r,\u03d5^(1)\u223c g - small corrections. Substituting Eqs.(<ref>) and Eq.(<ref>) into the Eqs.(<ref>), equating terms of the same order and accounting for x=rcos(\u03d5) we arrive at a set of equations for corrections in the form\n\n    \u0394_\u22a5 D^(1)_r-D^(1)_r/r^2-2/r^2\u2202 D^(1)_\u03d5/\u2202\u03d5 =D_r^(1)+2\u03bd g K_1(r)rcos(\u03d5), \n       \u0394_\u22a5 D^(1)_\u03d5-D^(1)_\u03d5/r^2+2/r^2\u2202 D^(1)_r/\u2202\u03d5 =D^(1)_\u03d5.\n\nNext we decompose D_r^(1) and D_\u03d5^(1) in a Fourier series\n\n    D_r^(1)(r,\u03d5)=\u2211D\u0303^r_n (r) cos(n \u03d5), \n       D_\u03d5^(1)(r,\u03d5)=\u2211D\u0303^\u03d5_n (r) sin(n \u03d5),\n\nand substitute this decomposition into Eqs.(<ref>). Equating amplitudes of corresponding cosines and sines we have\n\n    1/r\u2202/\u2202 r[r \u2202 D^r_1/\u2202 r]-2/r^2 D^r_1-2/r^2D^\u03d5_1=D^r_1+2\u03bd g K_1(r)r, \n       1/r\u2202/\u2202 r[r \u2202 D^\u03d5_1/\u2202 r]-2/r^2D^\u03d5_1-2/r^2 D^r_1 =D^\u03d5_1.\n\nNext we introduce new functions \u03a8=D_1^r+D_1^\u03d5 and \u03a6=D_1^r-D_1^\u03d5. Adding and subtracting Eqs.(<ref>) we get\n\n    1/r\u2202/\u2202 r[r \u2202\u03a8/\u2202 r]-4/r^2\u03a8=\u03a8+2\u03bd g K_1(r)r, \n       1/r\u2202/\u2202 r[r \u2202\u03a6/\u2202 r]=\u03a6+2\u03bd g K_1(r)r.\n\nA general solution to the equations above is zero as none of the functions fulfill boundary conditions \u03a8(\u221e)\u2192 0, \u03a6(\u221e\u2192 0) and \u03a8(0)<\u221e, \u03a6(0)<\u221e. \nA specific solution on the other hand does not vanish and could be found via Hankel transformation. Forward and inverse Hankel transformation of the order n of some function f(r) are given by\n\n    f\u0302(k)=\u210b_n[f(r)]\u2261\u222b_0^\u221er f(r) J_n(k r) dr, \n       f(r)=\u210b_n^-1[f\u0302(k)]\u2261\u222b_0^\u221ek f\u0302(k) J_n(k r) dk.\n\nHere J_n(k r) is the Bessel function of the fist kind of the order n.\n\nWe apply \u210b_2 to the fist equation and \u210b_0 to the second equation and get\n\n    \u03a8\u0303=-4\u03bd gk^2/(1+k^2)^2, \n       \u03a6\u0303=-4\u03bd g1/(1+k^2)^2.\n\nInverse Hankel transform gives\n\n    \u03a8=-4\u03bd g\u210b_2^-1[k^2/(1+k^2)^3]=-\u03bd g/2r^2K_0(r), \n       \u03a6=-4\u03bd g\u210b_0^-1[1/(1+k^2)^3]=-\u03bd g/2r^2 K_2(r).\n\nD^r_1 and D^\u03d5_1 are recovered as\n\n    D^r_1=\u03a8+\u03a6/2, \n       D^\u03d5_1=\u03a8-\u03a6/2,\n\nand reads\n\n    D^r_1=-\u03bd g/4r^2[K_0(r)+K_2(r) ],\n       D^\u03d5_1=-\u03bd g/4r^2[K_0(r)-K_2(r)].\n\nFinally, first order corrections could be written as\n\n    D_r^(1)=-\u03bd g/4r^2[K_0(r)+K_2(r) ] cos(\u03d5),\n       D_\u03d5^(1)=-\u03bd g/4r^2[K_0(r)-K_2(r)] sin(\u03d5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SHAPE MODIFICATION OF THE PLASMA BUBBLE \n\n\n\n \nWe neglect the effect of the plasma self-fields on the trajectories of the plasma electrons. This is a \u201cballistic\u201d regime of plasma motion introduced in Ref.<cit.>; it assumes that the plasma electrons are moving with constant velocities.\n\nWe assume plasma electrons to be non-relativistic and v_z0\u22481 and \u03bd\u226a 1 as well as  \u03bd\u226a r < 1. With help of Eq.(<ref>) and Eq.(<ref>) \nwe may write equations of motion for the plasma electrons as  \n\n    dx/d\u03be\u22482\u03bd/r_0cos(\u03d5_0)-g\u03bd/2, \n       dy/d\u03be\u22482\u03bd/r_0sin(\u03d5_0).\n\nSolution to the equations above gives electron trajectories\n\n    x=r_0cos\u03d5_0+2\u03bd\u03be[cos(\u03d5_0)/r_0-g/4], \n       y=r_0sin\u03d5_0+2\u03bd\u03besin(\u03d5_0)/r_0.\n\nFrom Eqs.(<ref>) one can deduce (see Appendix <ref>) an equation of an envelope surface that defines the boundary of the bubble in the ballistic approximation in a form\n\n    (\n        x+1/2\u03bd\u03be g\n        )^2\n        +\n        y^2\n        =\n        8\u03bd\u03be\n        .\n\nIt could be seen from the equation above that the circular cross sections of the bubble in x,y plane are shifted in the x direction by the distance \u03bd\u03be g/2 that is linearly increasing with \u03be.\n\nWe introduce the coordinates  x\u0303 = x+g\u03bd\u03be /2, \u1ef9=y and r\u0303 = \u221a(x\u0303^2+\u1ef9^2) and the angle \u03d5\u0303 = arccosx\u0303/ r\u0303. Then Eqs.(<ref>) can be written as\n\n    r\u0303\n        =\n        r_0 + 2\u03bd\u03be/r_0,\n            \u03d5\u0303\n        =\n        \u03d5_0\n        .\n\n\nCondition d r\u0303/ d r_0=0 gives equation for the bubble boundary \n\n    r\u0303_b(\u03be)= 2\u221a(2\u03bd\u03be),\n\nin full agreement with Ref.<cit.>.\nSwitching back to the (x,y) we arrive at the final expression for the bubble boundary in the form\n\n    r_b(\u03be,\u03d5)=2\u221a(2\u03bd\u03be)-g\u03bd\u03be/2cos( \u03d5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 AXIAL SYMMETRY OF THE CONTINUITY EQUATION IN THE BALLISTIC APPROXIMATION\n\n\nFirst, we refer to the continuity equation (<ref>) that in the ballistics approximation takes the form\n\n    _\u03be n_e +\u2207_\u22a5\u00b7 n_ev\u20d7_\u22a5 = 0.\n\nHere as before v\u20d7_\u22a5 is the vector of the transverse velocity of the plasma electrons that according to the Eq.(<ref>) reads\n\n    v\u20d7_\u22a5=(2\u03bd/r_0cos(\u03d5_0)-g\u03bd/2,2\u03bd/r_0sin(\u03d5_0) )^T.\n\nWe notice that\n\n    \u2202/\u2202x\u0303=\u2202/\u2202 x,\n       \u2202/\u2202\u1ef9=\u2202/\u2202 y.\n\n\nNext, if we assume that n=n(x\u0303,\u1ef9,\u03be) then Eq.(<ref>) should be modified as\n\n    _\u03be n_e+g\u03bd/2_x\u0303 n_e+v_x_x\u0303n_e+v_y_\u1ef9n_e\n       +n_e_x\u0303v_x+n_e_\u1ef9v_y = 0.\n\nIntroducing \u1e7d_\u22a5=(2\u03bd/r_0cos(\u03d5_0),2\u03bd/r_0sin(\u03d5_0) )^T, \u2207\u0303_\u22a5=(_x\u0303,_\u1ef9) and noting that \n\n    _x\u0303v_x=_x\u0303\u1e7d_x,\n\n\nwe have \n\n    _\u03be n_e +\u2207\u0303_\u22a5\u00b7 n_e\u1e7d_\u22a5 = 0.\n\nWe notice that in the new coordinates the plasma flow (in particular velocity field) has a cylindrical symmetry and thus continuity equation has a cylindrical symmetry as well and could be written as\n\n    _\u03be n_e +1/r\u0303\u2202/\u2202r\u0303r\u0303 n_e \u1e7d_\u22a5 = 0.\n\nwith \u1e7d_\u22a5=2\u03bd/r_0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PLASMA DENSITY IN THE BALLISTIC APPROXIMATION \n\n\n\n\nImmediately behind the driver, at \u03be=0^+, the plasma density n_0 is given by Eq.(<ref>). \nIf we assume that electron trajectories are known then from  the continuity of the plasma flow we conclude that \n\n    n(x,y,\u03be) dS = n_0(x_0,y_0) dS_0,\n\nfrom which it follows that\n\n    n(x,y,\u03be) = n_0(x_0,y_0) dS_0/dS.\n\nthe ration dS/dS_0 is calculated though the Jacobian\n\n    dS/dS_0=|\n    [ \u2202 x/\u2202 x_0 \u2202 x/\u2202 y_0; \u2202 y/\u2202 x_0 \u2202 y/\u2202 y_0;           ]|.\n\nNear the bubble boundary, as far as maximum bubble radius r_bm\u223c\u221a(\u03bd) and \u03bd\u226a 1, we can use electron trajectories as defined by Eq.(<ref>).

This is connected with the fact that we neglected screening effects in the considered approximation.\n\n\nWe switch back to the original coordinates r and \u03d5. Noticing that cos\u03d5 = cos\u03d5\u0303+\ud835\udcaa[g] and accounting for the fact that \u03c8\u0303(\u03ba) \u223c\ud835\udcaa[g] one may write\n\n    \u03c8(r,\u03d5,\u03be)=   \u03c8\u0303_0 ( r/r\u0303_b)+gr\u0303_b/16\u03c8\u0303^'_0 ( r/r\u0303_b) cos\u03d5\n    +    \u03c8\u0303_1 (r/r\u0303_b) cos\u03d5 +\ud835\udcaa[g^2].\n\n\nWe observe that, as expected, pseudopotential consists of two parts: monopole - that corresponds to the term \u03c8\u0303_0 ( r/r\u0303_b) and dipole - that is a combination of the total derivative by \u03ba of the monopole term \u03c8\u0303^'_0 ( \u03ba) and a correction \u03c8\u0303_1 (r/r\u0303_b). \n\nAt distances, r \u223c 1 plasma density should be unperturbed, and plasma electrons screen the field that arises from the bubble. This, in turn, results in the vanishing of the pseudopotential. To account for this and estimate the remaining unknown constants a_1 and b_1 we request pseudopotential to be zero at r =1. \n\nFist, we notice that at r \u226br\u0303_b expressions for the \u03c8\u0303_0 and \u03c8\u0303_1 reduces to\n\n    \u03c8\u0303_0 ( r/r\u0303_b) = a_1-r\u0303_b^2/8 - r\u0303_b^2/4log( 2 r/r\u0303_b)+\ud835\udcaa[r\u0303_b/r], \n       \u03c8\u0303_1 ( r/r\u0303_b) = b_1 r/r\u0303_b -g r\u0303_b^2/16r- g r\u0303_b^2/8r log( 2 r/r\u0303_b)+\ud835\udcaa[r\u0303_b/r].\n\nNext, keeping only divergent terms and setting r=1 we arrive at\n\n    a_1 \u2248r\u0303_b^2/4log(2/r\u0303_b), \n    \n        b_1 \u2248g r\u0303_b^3/8log(2/r\u0303_b).\n\n\nFollowing Eqs.(<ref>) and (<ref>) with Eq.(<ref>) and Eq.(<ref>) we arrive at the final expression for the pseudopotential inside the bubble in the form\n\n    \u03c8(r,\u03d5,\u03be)\u2248   r\u0303_b^2/4log(2/r\u0303_b)-r^2/4\n       -gr\u0303_b^2 cos\u03d5/8{ r/4- r log( 2/r\u0303_b)+r^3/r\u0303_b^2}.\n\nFor the analysis it is convenient to normalize pseudopotential to 1/r\u0303_b^2. We recall the definition of r\u0303_b given by Eq.(<ref>) and write the expression for the normalised pseudopotential\n\n    \u03c8/r\u0303^2_b=-1/8log(2\u03bd\u03be)-x_n^2+y_n^2/4\n       -g\u221a(2\u03bd\u03be)/4 x_n{1/4+ 1/2log(2\u03bd\u03be)+x_n^2+y_n^2  },\n\nwith x_n=x/r_b and y_n=y/r_b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ANALYSIS\n\n\nWith the help of the Eq.(<ref>) and Eq.(<ref>) transverse part of the Lorentz force per unit charge of the negatively charged test particle could be evaluated as\n\n    F_x=-x/2-gr\u0303_b^2 /8[1/4-log(2/r\u0303_b)+3x^2+y^2/r\u0303_b^2], \n       F_y=-y/2-gxy/4.\n\nIt is convenient to normalize it to 1/r\u0303_b and present in terms of x_n=x/r\u0303_b and y_n=y/r\u0303_b\n\n    F_x/r\u0303_b=-x_n/2-g\u221a(2 \u03bd\u03be)/4[1/4+1/2log(2\u03bd\u03be)+3x_n^2+y_n^2 ], \n       F_y/r\u0303_b=-y_n/2-g\u221a(2 \u03bd\u03be)x_n y_n/2.\n\nWe note that pseudopotential has a cubic term in x_n that naturally leads to two fixed points of the vector field (one stable and one unstable). \nBy setting F_x=0 and F_y=0 one may find fixed points of the transverse wakefield by solving the corresponding algebraic system that follows from Eq.(<ref>): \n\n    y_n^F=0, \n       x_n^S=-g\u221a(\u03bd\u03be)/4\u221a(2)[1+2log(2 \u03bd\u03be) ], \n       x_n^uS=-\u221a(2)/3g \u221a(\u03bd\u03be)+g\u221a(\u03bd\u03be)/4\u221a(2)[1+2log(2 \u03bd\u03be) ].\n\nTo simplify the final formula, we kept only terms of the order g, i.e. we disregarded terms of the order \ud835\udcaa[g^2 ] in Taylor decomposition.\n\n In Fig.<ref> we show level sets of the pseudopotential given by Eq.(<ref>), transverse wakefield vector field Eq.(<ref>) and fixed points of the vector field Eq.(<ref>) for three different values of the longitudinal coordinate \u03be. We chose extreme (and probably unreachable in practice) parameters of g=0.8 and \u03bd=1 to emphasize the effect. We observe that at small values of \u03be, where the model is directly applicable, only one stable fixed point exists within the bubble cross-section. Transverse gradient shifts the electromagnetic origin towards the higher densities of the ion column, but the net effect remains focusing albeit asymmetric. Further increase in \u03be does not change the picture. The asymmetry in the focusing grows, but the structure of the wake remains the same. Interestingly, if we speculate and go beyond the formal applicability of the considered model. We may observe the situation when both stable and unstable fixed points are located inside the bubble cross-section. We point out, that despite the complex structure of the pseudopotential, the stable region (the region where the beam is attracted to the stable fixed point) occupies more than half of the bubble cross-section even in this unrealistic scenario. The latter indicates that most likely fixed transverse plasma gradient (a transverse plasma gradient that does not change in z) should not affect the driver dynamics (at least within considered approximation) and only results in some asymmetric distortion of the bubble shape and wake.\n \nIt is worth mentioning that the plasma gradient may fluctuate randomly due to the random fluctuations of the plasma density. Such random fluctuation will result in a random kick. It is well known (see Refs.<cit.>) that random kicks may lead to emittance growth and potentially may lead to driver instability. Indeed, in 1D emittance growth (see for instance Ref.<cit.>) due to the random kick reads\n\n    \u03b4\u03b5/\u03b4 s=\u27e8 x^2\u27e9\u27e8 F_x^2\u27e9/\u03b5.\n\nHere \u03b5 is the beam emittance and \u03c4 is the characteristic time of the fluctuation. Following Eq.(<ref>) we can write\n\n    \u27e8 F_x^2\u27e9\u223c\u27e8 g^2\u27e9\u223c\u27e8 n^2\u27e9-n_0^2.\n\nConsequently, the dispersion of the density fluctuation sets the growth rate for the emittance. This observation motivates further studies in more realistic scenarios by either applying Lu model <cit.> or proper extension of a numerical simulation <cit.>.   \n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWe have presented a detailed analysis of the wakefield in the presence of the transverse plasma gradient. A simple ballistic model from Refs.<cit.> was updated to account for the linear transverse inhomogeneity in plasma. As a result, we provide final analytic expressions for the pseudopotential and the transverse wakefield. We note that as in the flat bubble regime considered previously in Ref.<cit.>, the bubble shape in the present study shows similar distortion. Namely, a small perturbation to the plasma density results in the \u201cbending\u201d of the bubble toward a lower plasma gradient. However, in contrast to the flat bubble regime, in the round bubble transverse wake does not vanish.  \n\nWe point out that random fluctuation of the plasma density, which naturally occurs, may lead to emittance growth and potentially become a challenge. Consequently, further developments in this direction are in order. \n\nWe note that the numerical examples provided in the paper\nare synthetic, and we choose parameters for these examples to emphasize corresponding effects. In reality, the parameter\ng\u2014 a transverse plasma gradient should be on the order of\n1% or less as well as \u03b6\u226a 1. We emphasize that the whole analysis is applicable only when plasma electrons are nonrelativistic. \n\nDespite the restrictions outlined above, the model presented is still useful, as it is complementary to the Lu model of the plasma bubble\n<cit.>. The model presented could be \"merged\" with the Lu model such that the results of the ballistic model may serve as\nan initial condition for the Lu equation. A combined model will be free of the empiric parameters and cover the whole range of the driver beam intensities. \n\nThe equation derived in the present paper could be used as a crude estimate for the transverse emittance growth due to the random fluctuations of the plasma density.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ENVELOPE SURFACES FOR THE BALLISTIC TRAJECTORIES \n\n\n\nFirst, we notice that if g=0, then as was shown in Ref.\u00a0<cit.>, for a given \u03be, the map\u00a0Eq.(<ref>) when r_0 varies from 0 to \u221e and \u03d5_0 varies from 0 to 2\u03c0 leaves and empty circle of radius 2\u221a(2\u03bd\u03be) centered at x=y=0. With a nonzero g, we can move the term -\u03bd\u03be g/2 from the right to the left-hand side. We then see that this empty circle is shifted by -\u03bd\u03be g/2 along x, and hence its equation is Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\n\n\n\nAnother approach is to consider an arbitrary ballistic trajectory as given by Eq.(<ref>). This trajectory could be represented in a vector form in xy\u03be space as\n\n    r=(x,y,\u03be)^T\n\nwith x and y given by Eq.(<ref>). \nNext we consider a transformation of the xy\u03be space along \u03be axis given by a rotation matrix \n\n    R_\u03be=(\n    [  cos\u03d5_0  sin\u03d5_0       0; -sin\u03d5_0  cos\u03d5_0       0;       0       0       1;         ])\n\nand apply to Eq.(<ref>). With Eq.(<ref>) we have\n\n    R_\u03be r = \n       ( r_0+2\u03be\u03bd/r_0-\u03be g \u03bd/2cos\u03d5_0,\u03be g \u03bd/2sin\u03d5_0,\u03be)^T.\n\nNext we consider rotation along x axis\n\n    R_x=(\n    [     1     0     0;     0  cos\u03b8 -sin\u03b8;     0  sin\u03b8  cos\u03b8;       ])\n\nsuch that tan(\u03b8)=\u03bd g/2sin (\u03d5_0). Combining Eq.(<ref>) with Eq.(<ref>) we get\n\n    R_xR_\u03be r = \n       ( r_0+2\u03be\u03bd/r_0-\u03be g \u03bd/2cos\u03d5_0,0,\u03be\u221a( 1+[g \u03bd/2sin\u03d5_0]^2))^T.\n\nIt follows from Eq.(<ref>) that xy\u03be space could be rotated with the help of R_xR_\u03be transformation such that after the combiner rotation any given trajectory will always lay in the Ox\u03be plane. Combiner rotation R_xR_\u03be depends only on the initial polar angle \u03d5_0 of the trajectory starting point and is independent of r_0. Consequently, we conclude that all trajectories with starting points with the same initial angle \u03d5_0 are transformed by the rotation R_xR_\u03be to the Ox\u03be plane as well. It is worth reiterating that all trajectories that start at the same initial angle \u03d5_0 will stay in the same plane and, with the help of two rotations R_\u03be and R_x, could be always translated into Ox\u03be plane. As far as the transformation R_x R_\u03be is not degenerate and has only one stationary point (0,0,0) trajectories that start from different angles \u03d5_0 never cross as different \u03d5_0 defines different rotations of the xy\u03be space. This, in turn, effectively reduces the initial problem of finding an envelope surface for all trajectories to a problem of finding an envelope curve for families of the trajectories with the same angle \u03d5_0 transformed to the Ox\u03be plane with the help of R_xR_\u03be rotation.\n\nIf x\u0303\u2261 r_0+2\u03be\u03bd/r_0-\u03be g \u03bd/2cos(\u03d5_0) then an envelope curve for each family according to Eq.(<ref>) could be written as\n\n    x\u0303_e=2\u221a(2\u03bd\u03be)-\u03be g \u03bd/2cos(\u03d5_0).\n\nThus, points on an envelope curve in a transformed plane have the coordinates \n\n    r\u0303_e = \n       ( 2\u221a(2\u03bd\u03be)-\u03be g \u03bd/2cos\u03d5_0,0,\u03be\u221a( 1+[g \u03bd/2sin\u03d5_0]^2))^T.\n\nInverse transformation R^-1_\u03be R_x^-1 applied to the Eq.(<ref>) gives a set of points that resemble envelope curve that results from the trajectories that have fixed polar angle \u03d5_0 for the starting points.\n\n    R^-1_\u03be R_x^-1r\u0303_e= \n       ( 2\u221a(2\u03bd\u03be)cos\u03d5_0-\u03be g \u03bd/2,2\u221a(2\u03bd\u03be)sin\u03d5_0,\u03be)^T.\n\nIf now x\u2261 2\u221a(2\u03bd\u03be)cos\u03d5_0-\u03be g \u03bd/2 and y\u22612\u221a(2\u03bd\u03be)sin\u03d5_0 then one can arrive at the Eq.(<ref>).\n\nThe analysis presented above has another important consequence. As far as each \u03d5_0 family of the trajectories forms a separate and independent of others envelope line, plasma density that results from electron blowout could be derived exactly the same way for each family in the transformed plane. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DIVERGENCE OF THE UNSCREENED PSEUDOPOTENTIAL FOR THE LARGE VALUES OF  KAPPA \n\n\n\nWe consider an asymptotic at \u03ba\u226b1 of the right hand side of the Eq.(<ref>) \n\n    r_b^3 g\u03ba   [\n        4\u03ba^2-3/4\u03ba\u221a(\u03ba^2-1)\u03b8(\u03ba -1)-1]\u2248\n       r_b^3 g\u03ba[\n        \u03b8(\u03ba -1)-1-\u03b8(\u03ba-1)/4\u03ba^2].\n\nWith this for \u03ba>1 Eq.(<ref>) reduces to\n\n    1/\u03ba\u2202/\u2202\u03ba[\u03ba\u2202\u03c8\u0303_1/\u2202\u03ba]-\u03c8\u0303_1/\u03ba^2\u2248-r_b^3 g/4\u03ba.\n\nParticular solution has the form\n\n    \u03c8\u0303_1\u2248r_b^3 g\u03ba/16(1-2log\u03ba)\n\naccounting for the log\u03ba\u226b1 we get\n\n    \u03c8\u0303_1\u2248 -r_b^3 g/8\u03balog\u03ba.\n\n\n\nThe author is grateful to G.
