As a model study, we let a massless quantum field be subjected to a parametric process for  a finite time interval such that the mode frequency of the field transits from one constant value to another. This configuration thus mimics a statically-bounded universe,  where there is an in and out state with the scale factor approaching constant, not a continuously evolving one.  The field subjected to squeezing by this process should contain some information of the process itself. If an atom is coupled to the field after the parametric process, its response will depend on the squeezing, and any quantum radiation emitted by the atom will carry this information away so that an observer at a much later time may still identify it. Our analyses show that 1) a remote observer cannot measure the generated squeezing via the radiation energy flux from the atom because the net radiation energy flux is canceled due to the correlation between the radiation field from the atom and the free field at the observer's location. However, 2) there is a chance to identify squeezing by measuring the constant radiation energy density at late times. The only restriction is that this energy density is of the near-field nature and only an observer close to the atom can use it to unravel the information of squeezing. The second part of this paper focuses on 3) the dependence of squeezing on the functional form of the parametric process. By explicitly working out several examples we demonstrate that the behavior of\nsqueezing does reflect essential properties of the parametric process. In fact, striking features may show up in more complicated processes involving various scales. These analyses allow us to establish the connection between properties of a squeezed quantum field and details of the parametric process which does the squeezing. Therefore,  4) one can construct templates  to reconstitute the unknown parametric processes from the data of measurable quantities subjected to squeezing. In a sequel paper these results will be applied to a study of quantum radiations in cosmology.\n\nFluctuations-Induced Quantum Radiation and Reaction  \n from an Atom in a Squeezed Quantum Field\n    Bei-Lok Hu0000-0003-2489-9914\n    March 30, 2023\n===============================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n=18pt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\nThis paper is the third of a series on quantum radiation, in the form of emitted radiation with an energy flux (distinct from thermal radiance felt by an accelerated atom, as in the Unruh effect <cit.>) from the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of an atom, tracing its origin to the vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field, including its back-reaction on the idf dynamics of the atom, in the form of quantum dissipation. In <cit.> two of us considered how vacuum fluctuations in the field act on the idf of an atom (we may call this the `emitter'), modeled by a harmonic oscillator. We first showed how a stochastic component of the internal dynamics of the atom arises from the vacuum fluctuations of the field, resulting in the emittance of quantum radiation.  We then show  how the back-reaction of this quantum radiation induces   quantum dissipation  in the atom's idf dynamics.  We  explicitly identified  the different terms representing these processes  in the Langevin equations of motion.  Then, using the example of a stationary atom, we show how in this simple case the absence of radiation  at a far away observation point where a probe (or detector \u2013 note the so-called  Unruh-DeWitt `detector' <cit.> is an emitter in the present context) is located is actually a result of complex cancellations of the interference between emitted radiation from the atom's idf  and the local fluctuations in the free field. In so doing we point out that the entity which enters into the duality relation with vacuum fluctuations is not radiation reaction[In the quantum optics literature, e.g., <cit.>, the relation between quantum fluctuations and radiation reaction is often mentioned without emphasizing the difference between classical radiation reaction\u00a0<cit.> and quantum dissipation, which exist at two separate theoretical levels. Only quantum dissipation enters in the fluctuations-dissipation relation with quantum fluctuations, not classical radiation reaction.], which can exist as a classical entity, but quantum dissipation <cit.>.  In the second paper <cit.> we considered the idf of the atom interacting with a quantum scalar field initially in a coherent state. We   showed  how the deterministic mean field drives the internal classical mean component to emit classical radiation and receive classical radiation reaction. Both components are statistically distinct and fully decoupled. It is clearly seen that the effects of the vacuum fluctuations of the field are matched with those of quantum radiation reaction, not with classical radiation reaction, as the folklore goes, even promulgated in some textbooks. Furthermore, we identified the reason why quantum radiation from a stationary emitter is not observed, and a probe  located far away only sees classical radiation.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Quantum Radiation from an Atom in a Squeezed Quantum Field\n\n\nIn this paper we treat quantum radiation from an atom's idf interacting with a quantum field in a squeezed state. The squeezed state is probably the most important quantum state,  next to the vacuum state, with both rich theoretical meanings and broad practical applications, as well-known in quantum optics. (See, e.g.,  <cit.>). We are particularly interested in its role in cosmology of the early universe.   \n\n \n\n  \nQuantum field squeezed by an expanding universe\n \nSqueezed states of a quantum field  are naturally produced in an expanding universe in fundamental processes  which involve the parametric amplification  of quantum fluctuations, such as particle creation <cit.>, either spontaneous production from the vacuum  or stimulated production from n-particle states, and structure formation <cit.>  from quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field. From relics such as primordial radiation and matter contents observed today, with the help of theoretical models governing their evolution, one attempts to deduce the state of the early universe at different stages of development. In addition to particle creation and structure formation we add here another fundamental quantum process, namely, quantum radiation. One can ask questions like, if such radiation of a quantum nature is detected, how can one use it to reveal certain quantum aspects of the early universe?  Revealing secrets of the early universe by digging out information  stored in the quantum field is \n\nin a similar spirit as the quest we initiated about the nonMarkovianity of the universe through the  memory kept in the quantum field <cit.>.  \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Three components: Radiation, Squeeze, Drive\n\n\nTowards such a goal we carry out this investigation which involves three components: 1) Quantum radiation 2) Squeezed state,  3) Driven dynamics, either under some external force  or as provided by an expanding universe, which describes how the squeeze parameter changes in time. Part 1)  was initiated in <cit.> and continued in <cit.>,  where the required technical tools for the present investigation can be found. \n\n\nPart 2) is performed here:  we  consider a quantum field in a squeezed state with a fixed squeeze parameter, regarded as the end state of the quantum field after being squeezed under some drive protocol or cosmological evolution. For the description of squeezed states we shall follow the descriptions in our earlier paper <cit.>.  Under the classification of the three types of squeezing described there, we shall adhere to the first type, namely, with fixed squeezing.  The second type of dynamical parametric  squeezing will be treated in our sequel cosmological papers. We shall set aside the third type of squeezing due to finite coupling between the system (here the atom's idf) and the environment (here the quantum field) completely.  \n  \n To see more explicitly what Part 3) entails, consider a situation where the atom at the initial time t_i is in a quantum field in a squeezed state with a fixed squeeze parameter \u03b6_i  and the same atom  at the final time t_f  in a squeezed field with a different squeeze parameter \u03b6_f. If an atom emits quantum radiation at either or both the initial and the final times, comparing the signals from both should tell us something about how the drive had affected the atom through the quantum radiation emitted from the atom, or in cosmology, how the universe had evolved as measured by the parametric squeezing of the field. The more challenging situation is if it turns out that there is no emitted quantum radiation from an atom in a squeezed field.  This is what our next work intends to find out.  \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Our objectives, in two stages\n\n\nWe wish to ask questions in the same spirit as in <cit.>: can we extract information about the history of the quantum field which had undergone a parametric process from the responses of an atom coupled to it  in the epoch after  the parametric process?  In particular,  for observers (receivers) situated far away from the atom (emitter) whether they can detect radiations emitted  from the atom of a quantum nature. Quantum radiation is of special interest as it originates from the vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field, and is expected to keep some memories of the parametric process it went through. In a cosmological context it acts as a carrier of  quantum information about the early universe. \n\n We divide our program of quantum radiation in cosmology into two stages, phrased as two questions. A) Is there emitted quantum radiation from a stationary atom in a  quantum field with a fixed squeeze parameter? If there is no emitted quantum radiation, then question B) Is there emitted quantum radiation from a stationary atom in a quantum field subjected to a changing squeeze parameter, such as in an expanding universe?  If so, what kind of evolutionary dynamics would produce what types of emitted radiation and with what magnitudes?  The first stage addresses components 1) and 2) listed above, the second stage, components 2) and 3), which will be continued in a follow-up paper.\n \n \n\n  \nRadiation pattern as template for squeezing\n \n This paper operates in the first stage, with a set up  meant for a statically-bounded universe, not the continuously evolving type such as in the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FLRW) or the inflationary universe. The first half answers the first question A), \n \n and the second half of this paper examines the response of the atom coupled to a field that had undergone a parametric process earlier.   This evokes the template idea, i.e.,  one can use the response of the atom, coupled to the field in the out-region, to identify the dependence of the squeeze parameter on the earlier parametric process before the out-region.  In the cosmology context, this offers a way for a late time observer of such quantum phenomena to uncover how the universe had evolved in much earlier times. \n   \n\n\n  \nStress-energy tensor of squeezed field\n\nTo answer the central question A),  we use a simplified model in which the quantum field undergoes a parametric process of finite duration, such as under an external drive for a definite period of time, or in an asymptotically stationary (statically bounded) universe. The field could be a quantized matter or graviton field, or an inflaton field whose quantum fluctuations engender cosmological structures. \nThen we calculate the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of the radiation field emitted by an atom coupled to a free field in a fixed two-mode squeeze state. In order to identify the unambiguous signals and conform to the typical settings, we focus on the late-time results. We learned from our earlier work <cit.> for a quantum field in the vacuum state  that the procedure for checking this is quite involved,  as it entails both the radiation flux emitted from the atom as detected at the spacetime point of the probe, and an incoming flux from infinity. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Key steps and major findings\n\n\nThe answer we found after calculating all relevant contributions for an atom in a quantum field in a squeezed state shows that there is no net radiation flux, same as in\u00a0<cit.>. This is a  consequence of relaxation dynamics of the atom's internal dynamics when it is coupled to the squeezed field\u00a0<cit.>. However, if the probe can measure the radiation energy density, it should obtain a residual constant radiation energy density at late time. Its value will fall off like the inverse cubic power of the distance between the probe and the atom. Thus it is more like a near-field effect. Nonetheless this energy density has an interesting characteristic: it depends on the squeeze parameter, which is what we are after.\n\nThus, our investigation turns to whether and how the squeeze parameter of the field after the parametric process would depend on the details of the process. We first show that the squeeze parameter can formally be expressed by the fundamental solutions of the parametrically driven field, the latter contains useful information about the process. Then by working out several examples numerically we can make the following observations:\n\n\n    \n  * For a monotonically varying process, the squeeze parameter has a monotonic dependence on the duration of this process; it does not depend on when the process starts, if we fix the duration.\n    \n    \n  * The magnitude of squeezing is related to the rate of change in the process. That is, large squeezing can be induced from a non-adiabatic transition. This is consistent with our understanding of spontaneous particle creation from parametric amplification of  vacuum fluctuations\u00a0<cit.> and that copious particles can be produced at the Planck time under rapid expansion of the universe\u00a0<cit.>. Thus we expect that  non-adiabatic processes may contribute to larger residual radiation energy density around the atom. \n    \n    \n  * For a non-monotonic parametric process, various scales in the process induces richer structure to the behavior of the squeeze parameter. In particular, if the parametric process changes with time sinusoidally at some frequency range, it may induce parametric resonance and yield exceptionally large squeezing in the out-region.\n\nSimilar considerations can likewise be  applied to the frequency spectrum of the squeeze parameter of the field in the out-region. One can then examine its dependence on the parametric process which the field has gone through. This illustrates the way to obtain templates in how the squeeze parameter is related to the parametric process, and how certain information of the unknown parametric process can be inferred from these templates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Organization\n \nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.\u00a0<ref>, as a prerequisite, we briefly summarize our earlier results on the relaxation process of the atom-field interaction, and pose the questions we would like to answer in this paper. In Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we lay out the formalism and the essential tools for detailing the nonequilibrium evolution of the atom's internal dynamics and the squeezed field when they are coupled together. In Sec.\u00a0<ref> we study the general spatial-temporal behavior of the energy flux and the energy density of the radiation field and examine their late-time behaviors. In Sec.\u00a0<ref> we turn to the functional dependence of the squeeze parameter on the functional form of the parametric process. Several  examples are provided to illustrate the formal analysis. In Sec.\u00a0<ref> we give some concluding remarks. Appendix\u00a0<ref> offers a succinct summary of the two-mode squeezed state. In Appendices\u00a0<ref> and <ref>, we offer more details on the late-time, large distance behaviors of the energy flux and the energy density of the radiation field. In Appendices\u00a0<ref>, we discuss the time-translational invariance of the squeeze parameter in the out-region.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SCENARIO: QUANTUM RADIATION IN ATOM-FIELD SYSTEMS\n\n\n\nClassical radiation is a familiar subject. But what is its quantum field origin? Can one trace back its link all the way to quantum fluctuations? We obtained partial  answers  in our last two papers to this question for a harmonic  atom interacting with a quantum field in a vacuum and in a coherent states. This paper deals with a squeezed field, necessary for treating cosmological quantum processes.  Since fluctuation-induced quantum radiation is not a household topic yet, it might be useful to first provide a physical picture of the global landscape of quantum radiation based on our understanding from  previous works, setting the stage for the current work.\n\nIt has been shown that\u00a0<cit.> when the internal degree of freedom, modeled as a harmonic oscillator, of an atom (called a harmonic atom) in any initial state, is linearly coupled to a  massless linear scalar field in the stationary state, its motion will settle down to an equilibrium state. The presence of this equilibrium state, from the perspective of the atom, implies a balance of energy exchange between the atom and the environmental field. Expectantly,  the radiation generated by the nonequilibrium motion of the atom's internal degree of freedom propagates outward to spatial infinity. It is  lesser known whether and how, from the perspective of the field, the radiation energy from the atom is balanced. In our previous works\u00a0<cit.>, we have demonstrated that the correlation between the outward radiation field and the local free field at spatial infinity constitutes an inward energy flow to balance the outward radiation energy flow. Furthermore this inward flux serves to supplement the needed energy around the atom for the field to drive the atom's internal motion. Thus we clearly see how energy flows from the atom to spatial infinity and then back-flows to the atom. This is a consequence of the nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relations\u00a0<cit.> for the atom's internal degree of freedom and the free field. This is a stronger condition than the conservation of energy. This point is better appreciated once we take the global view of the total system, composed of the atom and field. The entire system is closed and the total energy is conserved, but this does not guarantee the energy exchange between two subsystems is balanced unless the reduced dynamics is fully relaxed to an equilibrium state. \n\n\n\nIf, instead, the internal degree of freedom of the atom is initially coupled to the quantum field in a nonstationary state, like the squeezed state, then will the nonstationary nature of the field prevent the internal degree of freedom from approaching an equilibrium state? We have shown that <cit.> when the (mode-dependent) squeeze parameters is time-independent, the atom's internal degree of freedom still settles down to an equilibrium state in the long run. The stationary components of the covariance matrix elements or the energy flows decay exponentially fast to time-independent constants as in the previous case, but the additional nonstationary components  fall off to zero. The mechanisms that account for the late-time behavior of the stationary and the nonstationary components seem to be quite distinct. For the stationary components, it is a consequence of dissipation dynamically adapting to the driving fluctuations from the environment, but for  the nonstationary components, cancellation due to fast phase variations in the nonstationary terms plays the decisive role. In contrast, from the viewpoint of the squeezed field, what is the nature of radiation emitted from the atom, and can this outward energy flux at distances far away from the atom find a corresponding inward flux at late times such that there is no net energy output to spatial infinity, as proven for the case of a stationary field? If so, what makes it possible?\n\n\nThese questions are of particular interest  in a cosmological setting for the consideration of fundamental issues described in the Introduction.  There,  evolution of the universe parametrically drives the ambient quantum field into a squeezed state. The extent of squeezing may depend on the characteristics of the parametric process actuated by the evolution of the background universe. When an atom is coupled to such a field, emitted radiation from the atom should carry   the information of squeezing of the field, which in turn may reveal the  evolution history of the universe.\n\n\n\n\nAs a prerequisite to addressing these issues, in this paper we will examine a simpler configuration that may cover the essential features. Consider in Minkowski spacetime, a massless scalar field undergoes a parametric process such that each mode frequency changes smoothly from one constant value, say \u03c9_i, to another \u03c9_f, for example, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. The parametric process occurs during the time interval t_a\u2264 t\u2264 t_b. In the out-region (t\u2265 t_b) of the process, an atom is coupled to the squeezed field at time t_0. The nonequilibrium evolution of the internal degree of freedom of the atom then generates outward radiation, which after time r will reach a detector (like a satellite around the earth) far distance r away from the atom. The detector may measure the time variation of the energy flux. The corresponding signal will be extracted and amplified to sieve out the information regarding the parametric process of the field occurred earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MASSLESS SCALAR FIELD INTERACTING WITH A HARMONIC ATOM\n\n\n\nFor the case of a massless scalar field \u03d5 coupled to a static atom, with its internal degree of freedom \u03c7 represented by a harmonic oscillator, we have the following Heisenberg equations of motion \n\n    \u03c7\u0308\u0302\u0308(t) + \u03c9_b^2 \u03c7\u0302(t)    = e/m\u03d5\u0302(0, t) ,\n    (\u2202_t^2 - \u2207^2  )\u03d5\u0302(x, t)    =e \u03b4^(3)(x) \u03c7\u0302(t) ,\n\nwhere the atom is located at the origin of the spatial coordinates x in a 3+1 Minkowski spacetime. The parameter e denotes the coupling strength between the internal degree of freedom of the atom and the field, and \u03c9_b is the bare frequency of the oscillator.  Solving the equation of  motion of the field (<ref>) yields\n\n    \u03d5\u0302(x, t) = \u03d5\u0302_h(x, t) + e \u222b_0^tds   G^(\u03d5)_R, 0(x, t ; 0, s) \u03c7\u0302(s) ,\n\nwhere the homogeneous part \u03d5\u0302_h(x, t) gives the free field while the integral expression represents the radiation field emitted by the atom. The retarded Green's function G^(\u03d5)_R, 0(x, x') of the free field is defined by \n\n    G^(\u03d5)_R, 0(x, x') =i \u03b8(t-t') [\u03d5\u0302_h(x), \u03d5\u0302_h(x')]=1/2\u03c0\u03b8(\u03c4) \u03b4 (\u03c4^2 - R^2) ,\n\nwhere x=(x,t), \u03c4=t-t', R=|x-x'|, and \u03b8(\u03c4) is the Heaviside unit-step function. In the special case R \u2192 0 which is met for a single Brownian oscillator, we instead have \n\n    G^(\u03d5)_R, 0(t, t')= - 1/2\u03c0\u03b8(\u03c4) \u03b4'(\u03c4) .\n\nHere we have suppressed the trivial spatial coordinates 0. The superscript of the Green's function indicates the operator by which the Green's function is constructed, while the 0 in the subscript reminds that the Green's function of interest is associated with a free operator; otherwise it is an interacting operator. For example, G^(\u03d5)_R, 0(\u03c4) refers to the retarded Green's function of the free field while G^(\u03c7)_R(\u03c4) is the retarded Green's function of the interacting \u03c7.\n\n\nPlugging Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) into the equation of motion (<ref>) for the atom's internal degree of freedom, we get \n\n    \u03c7\u0308\u0302\u0308(t) + \u03c9_b^2 \u03c7\u0302(t) - e^2/m\u222b_0^tds   G^(\u03d5)_R, 0(t, s) \u03c7\u0302(s) = e/m\u03d5\u0302_h(0, t) .\n\nThis is the generalized quantum Langevin equation for \u03c7\u0302(t)  \u2013 it has included backreactions of the environmental field in terms of the noise force on the righthand side and the integral expression on the left hand side. As has been identified in (<ref>), the latter is the reaction force due to emitted radiation which retards the motion of the atom's internal degree of freedom.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the free field has a Markovian spectrum, we can reduce (<ref>) into a local form\n\n    \u03c7\u0308\u0302\u0308(t) + 2\u03b3\u03c7\u0307\u0302\u0307(t) + \u03c9^2_r \u03c7\u0302(t) = e/m\u03d5\u0302_h(0, t) ,\n\nand the oscillation frequency is renormalized to a physical value \u03c9_r. Since we want to examine the nature of radiation and its late time behavior in relation to the atom's internal dynamics in a self-consistent way, we need the field expression (<ref>) written in terms of the solution to the equation of the reduced dynamics (<ref>)\n\n    \u03c7\u0302(t) = \u03c7\u0302_h(t) + e\u222b_0^tds   G^(\u03c7)_R(t-s) \u03d5\u0302_h(0, s) ,\n\nwhere the retarded Green's function associated with \u03c7\u0302 has the form\n\n    G^(\u03c7)_R(\u03c4)=1/m\u03a9 e^-\u03b3\u03c4sin\u03a9\u03c4 ,\n\nwith \u03a9=\u221a(\u03c9_r^2-\u03b3^2), and \u03c7\u0302_h(t) is the homogeneous part.

For the reason that will be explained in Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we assume the initial state of the field the atom interacts with is a time-independent two-mode squeezed thermal state, for which the field's density matrix has the form \n\n    \u03c1\u0302_tmst = \u220f_k\u015c_2^(\u03b6_k) \u03c1\u0302_\u03b2\u015c^\u2020_2(\u03b6_k)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0302_\u03b2 is the thermal density matrix of the free field at temperature T_b=\u03b2^-1, and \u015c_2(\u03b6_k) is the two-mode squeeze operator, with squeeze parameter \u03b6_k = \u03b7_k e^i\u03b8_k, defined by\n\n    \u015c_2(\u03b6_k)=exp[\u03b6^*_k \u00e2_+k^\u00e2_-k^-\u03b6_k \u00e2_+k^\u2020a_-k^\u2020] .\n\nFor the reader's convenience we have collected the essential properties of the two-mode squeezed state in Appendix\u00a0<ref>. Here we will assume that the squeeze parameter is mode-independent to simplify the arguments.\n\n\nIf the free field has the plane-wave expansion \n\n    \u03d5\u0302_h(x) = \u222bd^3 k/(2\u03c0)^3/2 1/\u221a(2\u03c9)[\u00e2_k e^ik\u00b7 x + \u00e2^\u2020_k e^-ik\u00b7 x] ,\n\nwith k\u00b7 x = -\u03c9 t + k\u00b7x and \u03c9=|k|, then the free field's Hadamard function for this two-mode squeezed thermal state has the form \n\n    G^(\u03d5)_H, 0(x, x') = \u222bd^3 k/(2\u03c0)^3 1/4\u03c9 \u03b2\u03c9/2 e^ik\u00b7(x-x') [cosh2\u03b7 e^-i\u03c9(t-t') -sinh2\u03b7 e^i\u03b8e^-i\u03c9(t+t')]+ C.C. .\n\nAfter carrying out the angular integration, we arrive at the following decomposition\n\n    G^(\u03d5)_H, 0(x, x') = G^(\u03d5),st_H, 0(x, x') + G^(\u03d5),ns_H, 0(x, x') ,\n\nwith\n\n    G^(\u03d5),st_H, 0(x, x')   = \u222b_-\u221e^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 cosh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2 sin(\u03c9|x-x'|)/4\u03c0|x - x'| e^-i\u03c9(t-t') ,\n    \n        G^(\u03d5),ns_H, 0(x, x')   =-\u222b_0^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 sinh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2 sin(\u03c9|x-x'|)/4 \u03c0|x-x'| e^-i\u03c9(t+t')+i \u03b8 + C.C. .\n\nObserve that the Hadamard function has an extra component that is not invariant under time translation, so we call it the nonstationary component of the Hadamard function. This is distinct from the case we consider in\u00a0<cit.>. The emergence of this component is a consequence of the field being squeezed. We shall discuss its dynamical origin  in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. This nonstationary nature of the free field's Hadamard function will impact on the dynamical evolution of the atom's internal dynamics because the Hadamard function governs the statistics of the noise force  sourcing (<ref>), which naturally raises the concern whether the internal dynamics can ever equilibrate. As was mentioned earlier, it turns out the atom's internal motion can still relax to an  equilibrium, meaning time-translation invariant, state. Details of derivations and discussions on this point can be found in Ref.\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\nEq.\u00a0(<ref>) or (<ref>) is the essential ingredient used to express the Hadamard function G^(\u03d5)_H(x, x') of the interacting field, which we will need to evaluate the stress-energy tensor. Following the decomposition laid out before (<ref>), the interacting field's Hadamard function is given by\n\n    G^(\u03d5)_H (x,x')     = 1/2\u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_h(x), \u03d5\u0302_h(x') }\u27e9 + 1/2[\u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_h(x), \u03d5\u0302_br(x')}\u27e9 + \u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_br(x), \u03d5\u0302_h(x')}\u27e9]\n                    + 1/2\u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_br(x), \u03d5\u0302_br(x') }\u27e9 + 1/2\u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_tr(x), \u03d5\u0302_tr(x') }\u27e9 ,\n\nwhere\n\n    1/2\u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_h(x), \u03d5\u0302_h(x') }\u27e9    = G^(\u03d5)_H, 0(x,x') , \n    1/2\u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_h(x), \u03d5\u0302_br(x')}\u27e9   =e^2\u222b_0^t' ds_1'  G_R, 0^(\u03d5)(x', t' ;0, s_1')\u222b_0^s_1' ds_2' G_R^(\u03c7)(s_1' - s_2') G_H, 0^(\u03d5) (x, t; 0, s_2') ,\n    1/2\u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_br(x), \u03d5\u0302_br(x') }\u27e9   =e^4\u222b_0^t ds_1\u222b_0^t'ds_1'  G_R, 0^(\u03d5)(x,t;0, s_1) G^(\u03d5)_R, 0 (x', t'; 0, s_1')\n               \u00d7\u222b_0^s_1 ds_2\u222b_0^s_1' ds_2'  G_R^(\u03c7)(s_1 - s_2)G_R^(\u03c7)(s_1' - s_2') G^(\u03d5)_H, 0(0, s_2 ; 0, s_2') ,    \n    1/2\u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_tr(x), \u03d5\u0302_tr(x') }\u27e9   =e^2/2\u222b_0^t ds\u222b_0^t' ds'  G_R, 0^(\u03d5)(x,t; 0 , s) G_R, 0^(\u03d5)(x', t'; 0 , s')  \u27e8{\u03c7\u0302_h(s) , \u03c7\u0302_h (s') }\u27e9 .\n\nThe second group inside the square brackets is of special interest because it describes the correlation between the radiation field and the free field at any location outside the atom. We do not see such counterpart in classical electrodynamics because in classical field theory, there is no vacuum state to establish any correlation with the radiation field. Here the correlation must be present because 1) the internal dynamics of the atom, which emits the radiation, is driven by the free field at the atom's location and 2) the free field has nonvanishing correlation among any spacetime interval. Note that we are in the Heisenberg picture, so the expectation values are evaluated with respect to the initial state of both subsystems. The contribution in (<ref>) can be ignored at late times due to its transient nature. In addition, we also note that these four components are at most linearly proportional to G^(\u03d5)_H, 0(x,x'). Thus, at least before t-r\u226b\u03b3^-1, the interaction field is expected to behave like a squeezed field to some extent.\n\n\n\nFor later convenience, we introduce a shorthand notation for an expression which comes up frequently,\n\n    L_\u03c9(x, t) =  \u222b_0^t ds_1   G^(\u03d5)_R, 0(x, t-s_1)\u222b_0^s_1 ds_2   G^(\u03c7)_R(s_1 - s_2) e^-i\u03c9 s_2 .\n\nAfter we carry out the integrations, we find its explicit form is given by\n\n    L_\u03c9(x, t)   =\u03b8(t - r) G_R^(\u03c7)(\u03c9) {G_R, 0^(\u03d5)(x; \u03c9) e^-i\u03c9 t - e^-\u03b3(t - r)/4\u03c0\u03a9 r[(\u03c9+i\u03b3) cos\u03a9(r-t) + i \u03a9 sin\u03a9(r-t)] } ,\n\nwhere we have used the identity for the Fourier transform of G_R, 0^(\u03d5)(x,\u03c4;0, 0)\n\n    G_R, 0^(\u03d5)(x; \u03c9)=e^i\u03c9 r/4\u03c0 r\n    \nwith r=|x|. The convention of the Fourier transformation we adopt is\n\n    f(t)=\u222b_-\u221e^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 f\u0303(\u03c9) e^-i\u03c9 t .\n\nAt times t\u226b r, we find that the dominant term in (<ref>) is given by\n\n    L_\u03c9(x, t) =\u03b8(t - r) G_R^(\u03c7)(\u03c9) G_R, 0^(\u03d5)(x; \u03c9)  e^-i\u03c9 t .\n \nThese are convenient snippets that will greatly simplify the analysis of the late-time behavior of the expectation values of the energy-momentum stress tensor of the interacting field. Henceforth, we will proceed with the analysis separately for the contributions due to the stationary and the nonstationary components of G^(\u03d5)_H, 0(x,x').\n\n\nAt late times, the explicit expressions for the stationary and nonstationary components of the Hadamard functions of the free field and the interacting field \u03d5 become relatively simple. The interacting field's Hadamard function can likewise be decomposed into a stationary and a nonstationary component, G^(\u03d5)_H(x, x') = G^(\u03d5),st_H(x, x') + G^(\u03d5),ns_H(x, x'), and\n\n    G^(\u03d5),st_H(x, x')   = G^(\u03d5),st_H, 0(x, x')+e^2\u222b_-\u221e^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 {G^(\u03d5),st_H, 0(x, 0;\u03c9) G_R^(\u03c7)*(\u03c9) G_R, 0^(\u03d5)*(x'; \u03c9). \n                                     +.

Analyses of the late-time energy flow of the field at distances far away from the atom resulting from the atom-field interaction are contained in Appendices\u00a0<ref> and <ref>.  A general discussion of the spatial-temporal behavior of the stress-energy tensor due to the radiation field emitted from the atom follows in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 STRESS-ENERGY TENSOR DUE TO THE RADIATION FIELD\n\nThe expectation value of the energy-momentum stress tensor due to the radiation field is defined by\n\n    \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_\u03bc\u03bd(x)\u27e9 = lim_x'\u2192 x{\u2202^2/\u2202 x^\u03bc\u2202 x'^\u03bd -  1/2g_\u03bc\u03bd g^\u03b1\u03b2\u2202^2/\u2202 x^\u03b1\u2202 x'^\u03b2}[  G^(\u03d5)_H (x,x') - G^(\u03d5)_H, 0(x,x') ]\n\nwith the signature of g_\u03bc\u03bd being (-,+,+,+). Here we have subtracted off the contribution purely from the free field, which is irrelevant to the atom-field interaction. Due to symmetry, it has no dependence on the azimuthal angle \u03d1 and the polar angle \u03c6 of the spherical coordinate system, so the stress-energy tensor already reduces to\n\n    L1.0T\u27e8\u0394T\u0302_\u03bc\u03bd\u27e9 = \n        \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tt\u27e9   \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tr\u27e9    0     0 \n    \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_rt\u27e9   \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_rr\u27e9    0     0 \n    \n            0     0      0     0 \n    \n            0     0     0      0 \n         .\n\nThen we will focus on the components \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tr\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tt\u27e9 that are relevant to our following discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the analysis is not limited to the large-distance and the late-time limits, so that we can have a more complete, global view of the energy flow and energy density of the field caused by the atom-field interaction. We will put the analysis in those specific regimes in Appendices\u00a0<ref> and <ref>.\n\n\nSince in our configuration the coupling between the harmonic atom and the massless scalar field takes a different form from that between the point charge and the electromagnetic fields, it would be more illustrative if we first quickly go over the elementary derivations of the continuity equation and the total atom-field Hamiltonian in the classical regime to highlight their differences.\n\nFrom the equation of motion of the scalar field (<ref>), if we multiply both sides by \u2202_t\u03d5, we obtain a local form of the continuity equation\n\n    \u2202_tu_\u03d5+\u2207\u00b7S_\u03d5=\ud835\uddc9 \u2202_t\u03d5 ,\n\nwhere \ud835\uddc9(x,t)=e \u03b4^(3)(x) \u03c7(t) serves as the point dipole associated with the atom, and we identify the field energy density u_\u03d5 and the field momentum density S_\u03d5 respectively by\n\n    u_\u03d5(x,t)   =1/2[\u2202_t\u03d5(x,t)]^2+1/2[\u2207\u03d5(x,t)]^2 ,   S_\u03d5(x,t)   =-\u2202_t\u03d5(x,t) \u2207\u03d5(x,t) .\n\nThe unusual issue with the right hand side of the continuity equation (<ref>) is best appreciated when we compare with the corresponding equation for the electromagnetic fields\n\n    \u2202_t u+\u2207\u00b7S   =-J\u00b7E ,      with   u   =1/2E^2+1/2B^2 ,     S   =E\u00d7B ,\n\nwhere J is the current density and the corresponding current is equal to e\u1e8b for a point charge at the location x.  The electric field E field is defined by E=-\u2207A^0-\u2202_tA and the magnetic field B by B=\u2207\u00d7A. Here A^0 is the scalar potential and A is the vector potential. Thus the right hand side of (<ref>) should bear a similar interpretation as -J\u00b7E, which is usually understood as the dissipation of the field energy due to the work done by the field on the charge. That is, it is the opposite of the power delivered by the Lorentz force. However, there are a few subtle catches: 1) In classical field theory, we seldom consider the free field component of the field equation, and we never have vacuum field fluctuations, so the electromagnetic fields in (<ref>) are usually assumed to be the field generated by the charge. In contrast, the quantum scalar field \u03d5 under our consideration is a full interacting field, comprising of the free field and the radiation field emitted by the atom. Thus the right hand side of (<ref>) will contain an extra contribution associated with the free field fluctuations. 2) The right hand side of (<ref>) does not correspond to the net power delivered by the field to the internal degree of freedom of the atom, which is e \u03d5(0,t) \u2202_t\u03c7(t), apart from a renormalization contribution, according to the right hand side of (<ref>). Then the interpretation of the right hand of (<ref>) is not so straightforward, even though it has a form of the dipole interaction, similar to the right hand side of (<ref>).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may trace such a feature to the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian H_\u03c7\u03d5 associated with the Lagrangian of the atom-field interacting system\n\n    L_\u03c7\u03d5=m/2 \u03c7\u0307^2-m\u03c9_b^2/2 \u03c7\u0307^2+\u222b_Vd\ud835\udcb1 e \u03b4(x)\u03c7(t)\u03d5(x,t)+\u222b_Vd\ud835\udcb1 {1/2[\u2202_t\u03d5(x,t)]^2-1/2[\u2207\u03d5(x,t)]^2} ,\n\nunder our consideration is given by\n\n    H_\u03c7\u03d5=m/2 \u03c7\u0307^2+m\u03c9_b^2/2 \u03c7\u0307^2-e \u03c7(t)\u03d5(0,t)+\u222b_Vd\ud835\udcb1 {1/2[\u2202_t\u03d5(x,t)]^2+1/2[\u2207\u03d5(x,t)]^2} ,\n\nwhere we implicitly assume that \u03c7\u0307(t) and \u03d5\u0307(x,t) are functions of the respective canonical momenta, p(t) and \u03c0(x,t). The quantity V denotes the whole spatial volume on a fixed time slice. Since the whole atom-field system forms a closed system, the total energy is conserved, so we have dH/dt=0,\n\n    d/dtH_\u03c7\u03d5(t)=0   =\u03c7\u0307(t){m\u03c7\u0308(t)+m\u03c9_b^2\u03c7(t)-e \u03d5(x,0)}\n                       +\u222b_Vd\ud835\udcb1 [-e \u03b4(x)\u03c7(t) \u2202_t\u03d5(x,t)+d/dt{1/2[\u2202_t\u03d5(x,t)]^2+1/2[\u2207\u03d5(x,t)]^2}] .\n\nNote how the derivative of the interaction term is distributed, and further observe that the contribution inside of the first pair of curly brackets gives zero, following the equation of motion (<ref>). It actually has a nice interpretation. Following the derivations of (<ref>) and (<ref>), it accounts for the reduced dynamics of the atom's internal degree of freedom, and, from the atom's perspective, describes the energy exchange between the atom and the surrounding quantum field.\n\n\n\nThe integral on the right hand side of  (<ref>), on the other hand, describes the energy exchange from the field's perspective, and thus gives zero too. In the integrand, we see the presence of the same dipole interaction term e \u03b4(x)\u03c7(t) \u2202_t\u03d5(x,t) that appears on the righthand side of (<ref>). At first sight it may seem odd that the dipole interaction term is solely responsible for the change of the field energy. However, we can further show\n\n    d/dtH_\u03c7\u03d5(t)=0=\u222b_Vd\ud835\udcb1 \u2207\u00b7[\u2207\u03d5(x,t) \u2202_t\u03d5(x,t)]=-\u222e_\u2202 Vd\ud835\udc9c\u00b7S(x,t) .\n\nIt says that there is no flux entering from or leaving to spatial infinity because the boundary \u2202 V of the space volume V is at spatial infinity. It is a rephrase of energy conservation in a closed system, so there is no inconsistency. On the other hand, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is too restrictive because V is the total volume. The differential form of the continuity equation (<ref>) is more suitable to see the energy distribution in the field.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to (<ref>), the Hamiltonian for the interacting system of a point charge and the electromagnetic field is\n\n    H_xA=m_b/2 \u1e8b^2+m_b\u03c9^2/2 x^2+1/2\u222b_Vd\ud835\udcb1 (E^2+B^2) .\n\nIt does not have the interaction term manifestly if the Hamiltonian is not expressed in terms of the canonical momentum of the charge. However, it is consistent with the observation that -J\u00b7E is opposite to the power delivered by the Lorentz force.\n\n\n\nNow we discuss the general result of \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_\u03bc\u03bd\u27e9 that will be valid for t>r at any location distance r away from the atom, so we come back to the manipulation of quantum operators. We first compute \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tr\u27e9.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 General behavior of field energy flux \n\nIf we write \u03d5\u0302_r(x,t) as\n\n    \u03d5\u0302_r(x,t)=e\u222b_0^tds G_R,0^(\u03d5)(x,t;0,s) \u03c7\u0302(s)=e/4\u03c0 r \u03b8(t-r) \u03c7\u0302(t-r) ,\n\nwhich explicitly shows that the radiation field is a retarded Coulomb-like field emitted by a source at an earlier time t-r. Note that the simple expression of the radiation field like (<ref>) is not obtainable if the field has a non-Markovian spectrum. \n\n\nWith the help of (<ref>), we obtain\n\n    1/2\u27e8{\u2202_t\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t), \u2202_r\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t)}\u27e9   =-(e/4\u03c0 r)^2\u27e8\u03c7\u0302'^2(t-r)\u27e9-(e/4\u03c0 r)^21/2r\u27e8{\u03c7\u0302'(t-r), \u03c7\u0302(t-r)}\u27e9 ,\n\nfor t>r, where a prime denotes taking the derivative with respect to the function's argument. If we compute the energy flow associated (<ref>), across any spherical surface of   radius r centered at the atom, we get\n\n    \u222b_\u2202 Vd\ud835\udc9c 1/2\u27e8{\u2202_t\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t), \u2202_r\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t)}\u27e9   =-2m\u03b3 \u27e8\u03c7\u0302'^2(t-r)\u27e9-m\u03b3/r \u27e8{\u03c7\u0302'(t-r), \u03c7\u0302(t-r)}\u27e9\n       =P_\u03b3(t-r)-m\u03b3/r \u2202_t\u27e8\u03c7\u0302^2(t-r)\u27e9 ,\n\nwhere we have used the substitution e^2=8\u03c0\u03b3 m. The first term has a special significance. From\u00a0<cit.>, we know that P_\u03b3(t) is the energy the atom's internal degree of freedom loses to the surrounding field due to damping. Thus the first term tells that the energy lost by the atom at time t-r takes time r to propagate to a location at a distance r away from the atom. It is the only contribution in (<ref>) that may survive at spatial infinity.\n\n\n\nThe contribution from the cross terms need a little more algebraic manipulations, but it gives\n\n    1/2\u27e8{\u2202_t\u03d5\u0302_h(x,t), \u2202_r\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t)}\u27e9+1/2\u27e8{\u2202_t\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t), \u2202_r\u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9\n       =1/4\u03c0 r^2 P_\u03be(t-r)-e^2/4\u03c0 r^2\u2202/\u2202 t\u222b_0^t-rds G_R^(\u03c7)(t-r-s) G_H,0^(\u03d5)(x,t;0,s) ,\n\nin which the integral in the last expression is nothing but\n\n    e^2\u222b_0^t-rds G_R^(\u03c7)(t-r-s) G_H,0^(\u03d5)(x,t;0,s)=e/2\u27e8{\u03c7\u0302(t-r), \u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9 .\n\nHere P_\u03be(t) is the power the free quantum field fluctuations deliver to the atom's internal dynamics at time t at the atom's location. Then we find the incoming energy flow given by \n\n    \u222b_\u2202 Vd\ud835\udc9c [1/2\u27e8{\u2202_t\u03d5\u0302_h(x,t), \u2202_r\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t)}\u27e9+1/2\u27e8{\u2202_t\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t), \u2202_r\u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9]\n       =P_\u03be(t-r)-\u2202/\u2202 t[e/2\u27e8{\u03c7\u0302(t-r), \u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9] .\n\nCombining (<ref>) and (<ref>), we thus have \n\n    \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tr\u27e9=1/4\u03c0 r^2{P_\u03be(t-r)+P_\u03b3(t-r)-\u2202/\u2202 t[m\u03b3/r \u27e8\u03c7\u0302^2(t-r)\u27e9+e/2\u27e8{\u03c7\u0302(t-r), \u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9]} ,\n\nFrom the relaxation of the reduced dynamics of the atom's internal degree of freedom, outlined in the beginning of Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we  learn that the internal dynamics will reach equilibrium, where P_\u03be(t)+P_\u03b3(t)=0 for t\u226b\u03b3^-1. Hence, from (<ref>), we easily conclude that, for a fixed r, when t-r is much greater than the relaxation time scale, the sum of the dominant terms P_\u03be(t-r)+P_\u03b3(t-r) vanishes. At large distance away from the atom, the remaining terms are very small, decaying at least like 1/r^3. It is consistent with our results in Sec.\u00a0<ref>, where we explicitly show that they actually give zero at late times. Alternatively we may deduce the same conclusion here, since 1) \u27e8\u03c7\u0302^2(t)\u27e9 will approach a constant at late times as the  atom's internal dynamics  asymptotically reaches an equilibrium, and 2) with the help of the explicit expression\n\n    e/2\u27e8{\u03c7\u0302(t-r), \u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9=-e^2/4\u03c0 r\u222b_0^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 \u03b2\u03c9/2 cosh2\u03b7\u222b_0^t-rds G_R^(\u03c7)(t-r-s) sin\u03c9 r/4\u03c0 r^2 cos\u03c9(t-s) ,\n\nit is not difficult to see that the time derivative of the last term inside the square brackets will vanish at late times. \n\n\nThus, the detector away from the atom will not measure any radiation energy flux from the stationary atom at late times even though the atom is coupled to a nonstationary squeezed state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 General behavior of field energy density \n\n\nIt is also of interest to examine the change of the field energy density at distances far away from the atom resulting from their mutual interactions.  Conceptually, the atom's internal dynamics will send out to spatial infinity  spherical waves centered at the location of the atom. Due to the quantum nature of the internal dynamics, this radiation wave in general has a random phase and its magnitude is inversely proportional to the distance to the atom. Following our previous discussion, a detector at large but fixed distance away from the atom will receive a net outward energy flux in the beginning, and then it will find the magnitude of the flux rapidly falls off to zero with time. After all these activities settle down, will the earlier energy flux leave any footprint in the space surrounding the atom, say, by shifting the local field energy density, albeit almost imperceptibly? This is what we try to find out in this section.\n\n\n\n\nIn the same manner, we will re-write \u27e8\u0394 T_tt\u27e9, following (<ref>). Other than the overall factor 1/2, we first show\n\n    1/2\u27e8{\u2202_t\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t), \u2202_t\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t)}\u27e9+1/2\u27e8{\u2202_r\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t), \u2202_r\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t)}\u27e9=-2\u00d71/4\u03c0 r^2{P_\u03b3(t-r)+\u2202/\u2202 r[m\u03b3/r \u27e8\u03c7\u0302^2(t-r)\u27e9]} ,\n\nwhere \u2202_t\u03c7(t-r)=-\u2202_r\u03c7(t-r). Here due to the minus sign up front, this contribution tends to grow to a positive value at late times. We further note that the same expression P_\u03b3(t-r) also appears in the component (<ref>) of \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tr(t)\u27e9 that is purely caused by the radiation field. Thus, we see the outward energy flux due to (<ref>) imparts field energy into the space around the atom.\n\n\nFor the cross terms, we obtain\n\n    2\u00d71/2 \u27e8{\u2202_t\u03d5\u0302_h(x,t), \u2202_t\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t)}\u27e9+2\u00d71/2 \u27e8{\u2202_r\u03d5\u0302_h(x,t), \u2202_r\u03d5\u0302_r(x,t)}\u27e9\n       =-2\u00d71/4\u03c0 r^2{P_\u03be(t-r)+\u2202/\u2202 r[e/2\u27e8{\u03c7\u0302(t-r), \u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9]} .\n\nFollowing the same argument, the inward energy flux from (<ref>) on the other hand is prone to take away the field energy in the surrounding space.\n\n\nTogether we thus find that the net field energy density outside the atom is given by\n\n    \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tt\u27e9=-1/4\u03c0 r^2{P_\u03be(t-r)+P_\u03b3(t-r)+\u2202/\u2202 r[m\u03b3/r \u27e8\u03c7\u0302^2(t-r)\u27e9+e/2\u27e8{\u03c7\u0302(t-r), \u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9]} ,\n\nfor t>r>0. This looks very similar to (<ref>), and can be the consequence of the continuity equation. The dominant term in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) will vanish at late times, as a consequences of the relaxation of the internal dynamics of the atom, and the behavior of (<ref>) due to the appearance of t-r. Following our earlier arguments, the remaining term, \u27e8{\u03c7\u0302(t-r), \u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9, on the other hand, becomes a constant at late times, which falls off at least like 1/r^3, as is explicitly shown in Sec.\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\nIndeed, Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>) and (<ref>) enable us to verify the continuity equation\n\n    1/r^2\u2202/\u2202 r(r^2\u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tr\u27e9)   =1/4\u03c0 r^2{\u2202_rP_\u03be(t-r)+\u2202_rP_\u03b3(t-r)-\u2202^2/\u2202 t\u2202 r[m\u03b3/r \u27e8\u03c7\u0302^2(t-r)\u27e9+e/2\u27e8{\u03c7\u0302(t-r), \u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9]}\n       =1/4\u03c0 r^2{-\u2202_tP_\u03be(t-r)-\u2202_tP_\u03b3(t-r)-\u2202^2/\u2202 t\u2202 r[m\u03b3/r \u27e8\u03c7\u0302^2(t-r)\u27e9+e/2\u27e8{\u03c7\u0302(t-r), \u03d5\u0302_h(x,t)}\u27e9]}\n       =\u2202/\u2202 t\u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tt\u27e9 ,\n\nfor r>0. To include r=0, the location of the atom, we need the form (<ref>) which also takes into account the energy flow into and out of the atom, from the scalar field perspective.\n\n\nFrom the considerations presented so far we may now see better how the radiation flux, generated by the internal dynamics of the atom, propagates outward and at the same time intakes the field energy in space outside the atom. Meanwhile,  due to the remarkable correlation between the quantum radiation field and the free quantum field, there exists an inward flux. On its way toward the atom, it pulls out field energy stored in the proximity of the atom. From this hindsight, it can be understood that the net power e \u03d5(0,t)\u03c7\u0307(t) delivered by the quantum field to the atom is not equal to the rate of work done to the field e \u03d5\u0307(0,t)\u03c7(t), as can be inferred from (<ref>). Otherwise \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_tr\u27e9 in (<ref>) will simply be proportional to P_\u03be(t-r)+P_\u03b3(t-r). Their difference accounts for the field energy density stored in the space  for the configuration we have studied.\n\t\nIn summary,  the results in this section tell us that at late times the observer will not measure any net energy flow associated with the radiation emitted from the atom driven by the squeezed quantum field, but the observer can still detect a constant radiation energy density, which is related to the squeeze parameter. However, a restrictive condition is that the residual radiation energy density is of the near-field nature, and it  falls off with the distance to the atom like 1/r^3. Thus its detection can be difficult at large distances, unless the squeeze parameter is large.\n\n\nEven with these difficulties, we can still locally identify the squeezing via the response of the atom interacting with the squeezed field.\n\n\nIn the next section we shall discuss how the squeeze parameter depends on the parametric process the quantum field has experienced, such that we may acquire certain information about the process once we have measured the squeeze parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCE OF THE SQUEEZE PARAMETER ON THE PARAMETRIC PROCESS\n\nNow we turn to how we may possibly extract from the behavior of the squeeze parameter the information of the parametric process that occurs earlier. To be specific, consider the simple case that a massless quantum Klein-Gordon field in flat spacetime undergoes a parametric process such that the frequency of mode k transits smoothly from one constant value \u03c9_i for 0\u2264 t\u2264 t_a to another constant \u03c9_f for t\u2265 t_b>t_a. \n\n\nWe would like first to show that the quantum field in the out-region behaves as if it is in its squeezed thermal state with a time-independent squeeze parameter \u03b6_k if the initial state of the field at t=0 is a thermal state. Then we express the squeeze parameter in terms of the Bogoliubov coefficients,  a common tool to treat the dynamics of the quantum field in a parametric (time-varying) process. We will also link the squeeze parameter to the fundamental solutions of the equation of motion of the field, in which  information of the parametric process is embedded.\n\n\n\nWe work with the Heisenberg picture, so the field remains in its initial state at t=0. Formally we can expand the field operator \u03d5\u0302(x) in terms of different sets of mode functions. In the out-region, two convenient choices are\n\n    u_k^in(x)   =1/\u221a(2\u03c9_i) e^ik\u00b7x[d_k^(1)(t)-i \u03c9_i d_k^(2)(t)] ,   u_k^out(x)   =1/\u221a(2\u03c9_f) e^ik\u00b7xe^-i\u03c9_ft ,\n\nwhere d_k^(i)(t) satisfies the equation d\u0308_k^(i)+\u03c9^2(t) d_k^(i)(t)=0, and u_k^out(x) is the standard  plane-wave mode function in the out-region, while u_k^in(x) represents the mode function which evolves from the plane-wave mode function in the in-region.  Thus the field operator may have the expansion\n\n    \u03d5\u0302(x)   =\u2211_k\u00e2_k^u_k^in(x)+\u00e2_k^\u2020u_k^in*(x) ,   \n    \u2211_kb\u0302_k^u_k^out(x)+b\u0302_k^\u2020u_k^out*(x) ,      \u2211_k   =\u222bd^3k/(2\u03c0)^3/2 ,\n\nin the out-region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe further suppose (b\u0302_k^,b\u0302_k^\u2020) are related to (\u00e2_k^,\u00e2_k^\u2020) by\n\n    b\u0302_+k^=\u03b1_+k^ \u00e2_+k^+\u03b2_-k^* \u00e2_-k^\u2020 ,\n\nwhence the completeness condition implies that the Bogoliubov coefficients \u03b1_k, \u03b2_k can be parametrized by\n\n    \u03b1_k   =cosh\u03b7_k ,   \u03b2_-k^*   =-e^i\u03b8_k sinh\u03b7_k ,\n\nsuch that \n\n    b\u0302_+k^=cosh\u03b7_k \u00e2_+k^-e^i\u03b8_k sinh\u03b7_k \u00e2_-k^\u2020=\u015c_2^\u2020(\u03b6_k) \u00e2_+k^ \u015c_2^(\u03b6_k) .\n\nThe parametrization (<ref>) can be alternatively implemented by the two-mode squeeze operator \u015c_2^\u2020(\u03b6_k).

Thus Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) gives a Hadamard function in the two-mode squeezed in-state.

Here \u03c0\u0302(x) is the canonical momentum conjugated to \u03d5\u0302(x). Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) clearly tell how squeezing may dynamically arise from the parametric process of the field.\n\n\nAs a consistency check, we substitute the coefficients \u03b1_k, \u03b2_k on the righthand side by (<ref>), and obtain\n\n    |\u03b1_k^|^2+|\u03b2_k^|   =cosh2\u03b7_k ,   2\u03b1_k^\u03b2_k^*   =-e^i\u03b8_ksinh2\u03b7_k .\n\nIn fact, (<ref>) and (<ref>) only determine \u03b1_k, \u03b2_k up to a phase factor or a rotation, which we have been ignoring. For example, from (<ref>), we may let\n\n    \u03b1_k   =1/2\u221a(\u03c9_i\u03c9_f)[+i \u03c9_f d_k^(1)(t_f)+\u03c9_i\u03c9_f d_k^(2)(t_f)-\u1e0b_k^(1)(t_f)+i \u03c9_i \u1e0b_k^(2)(t_f)] ,\n    \u03b2_k   =1/2\u221a(\u03c9_i\u03c9_f)[-i \u03c9_f d_k^(1)(t_f)+\u03c9_i\u03c9_f d_k^(2)(t_f)+\u1e0b_k^(1)(t_f)+i \u03c9_i \u1e0b_k^(2)(t_f)] ,\n\nand then we can directly show that (<ref>) is recovered and \n\n    |\u03b1_k^|^2-|\u03b2_k^|^2=d_k^(1)(t_f) \u1e0b_k^(2)(t_f)-\u1e0b_k^(1)(t_f)d_k^(2)(t_f)=1 .\n\nHowever, obviously in this case \u03b1_k is not real, as (<ref>) implies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may recover the missing phase by putting back the rotation operator we have ignored all along. To be more specific, for example, let the rotation operator R\u0302 be given by\n\n    R\u0302(\u03a6_i)=exp[i\u03a6_i(\u00e2_i^\u2020\u00e2_i^+1/2)] .\n\nWe find R\u0302^\u2020(\u03a6_i) \u00e2_1R\u0302(\u03a6_1)=\u00e2_1 e^i\u03a6_1. Then,  depending on the order of the rotation operator and the squeeze operator, we may have either\n\n    \u015c_2^\u2020(\u03b6)R\u0302^\u2020(\u03a6_i) \u00e2_1R\u0302(\u03a6_i)\u015c_2^(\u03b6)   =e^i\u03a6_1cosh\u03b7 \u00e2_1-e^i\u03a6_1e^i\u03b8sinh\u03b7 \u00e2_2 ,\n    \torR\u0302^\u2020(\u03a6_i)\u015c_2^\u2020(\u03b6) \u00e2_1\u015c_2^(\u03b6)R\u0302(\u03a6_i)   =e^i\u03a6_1cosh\u03b7 \u00e2_1-e^i\u03a6_2e^i\u03b8sinh\u03b7 \u00e2_2 .\n\nWe see that there is always a phase ambiguity. In both cases, from (<ref>) and (<ref>), we find \u03b1_k will be complex in general, but in principle, we may factor out the overall phase factor for each mode to render \u03b1_k real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we proceed further with our analysis, let us examine a few illustrative examples. \n\n\n  \nCase 1\nConsider the parametric process in which the squared frequency \u03c9^2(t) varies with time according to\n\n    \u03c9^2(t)=\u03c9_i^2 ,   0\u2264 t\u2264 t_a ,\n    \u03c9_i^2+(\u03c9_f^2-\u03c9_i^2) t-t_at_b-t_a ,   t_a\u2264 t\u2264 t_b ,\n    \u03c9_f^2 ,   t\u2265 t_b ,\n\nThat is, \u03c9^2(t) is a piecewise-continuous function of time. The time evolution of d_k^(1)(t), d_k^(2)(t) are shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(b) and -(c), where we observe that the oscillation amplitudes of the two fundamental solutions change by different amounts, implying the occurrence of quantum squeezing. Notice in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(d), as t\u2265 t_b the squeeze parameter \u03b7_k becomes a constant,  squeezing is very small because cosh2\u03b7_k\u223c1. This small squeezing results from the slow transition rate in the parametric process. The plots (e) and (f) show oscillations of frequency 2\u03c9_f, consistent with expectation. However, from these plots it is hard to tell whether \u03b8_k is time independent. We will take another approach to show it later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nCase 2 In the second example, we choose a non-monotonic parametric process,\n\n    \u03c9^2(t)=\u03c9_i^2 ,   0\u2264 t\u2264 t_a ,\n    \u03c9_i^2+(\u03c9_f^2-\u03c9_i^2) sin^2[t-t_at_b-t_an\u03c02] ,   t_a\u2264 t\u2264 t_b ,\n    \u03c9_f^2 ,   t\u2265 t_b .\n\nHere n,  an odd integer, gives the number of oscillations of the transition process. Thus the frequency variation is not monotonic. The corresponding plots are shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. Since both processes, though continuous, are not smooth, it allows us to clearly see when the transitions start and end. Compared with Case 1, the non-monotonic transition introduces tumultuous behavior in the fundamental solutions d_k^(i) during the transition, in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(b) and -(c), but right after t=t_b, the out mode immediately oscillates at frequency \u03c9_f. Again,  we can see the time-independence of \u03b7_k in the out-region.\n\n\n\n\nFor the simple case we consider here, let us carry out some analysis about the time dependence of the squeeze parameter in the out-region. We may write d_k^(i)(t) for t\u2265 t_b as\n\n    d_k^(1)(t)=d_k^(1)(t_b) cos\u03c9_f(t-t_b)+d_k^(2)(t_b) 1/\u03c9_f sin\u03c9_f(t-t_b) ,\n    \n    \td_k^(2)(t)=d_k^(1)(t_b) 1/\u03c9_f sin\u03c9_f(t-t_b)+d_k^(2)(t_b) cos\u03c9_f(t-t_b) .\n\nThe amplitudes of d_k^(i)(t) in the out-region are determined by\n\n    d_k^(1)(t):       [d_k^(1)2(t_b)+d_k^(2)2(t_b)/\u03c9_f^2]^1/2 ,      and      d_k^(2)(t):       [d_k^(1)2(t_b)/\u03c9_f^2+d_k^(2)2(t_b)]^1/2 ,\n\nwhich in turns are determined by the values of the fundamental solution at the end of the parametric process. We readily find that d_k^(1)(t)\u1e0b_k^(1)(t)-\u1e0b_k^(1)(t)d_k^(1)(t)=1 for all t even for the parametric process via the Wronskian of the differential equation the mode function satisfies.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>), we can show\n\n    |\u03b1_k^(t)|^2+|\u03b2_k^(t)|^2=|\u03b1_k^(t_b)|^2+|\u03b2_k^(t_b)|^2\n\nfor all t\u2265 t_b. Since |\u03b1_k^|^2+|\u03b2_k^|^2 is proportional to cosh2\u03b7_k, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) then shows that \u03b7_k is a time-independent constant for all t\u2265 t_b. On the other hand, with the help of (<ref>) and (<ref>), we find\n\n    1/\u03c9_f\u03c9_i \u1e0b_k^(1)2(t)+\u03c9_i/\u03c9_f \u1e0b_k^(2)2(t)-\u03c9_f/\u03c9_i d_k^(1)2(t)-\u03c9_f\u03c9_i d_k^(2)2(t)   =A_k sin(2\u03c9_ft_b-2\u03c9_ft)+B_k cos(2\u03c9_ft_b-2\u03c9_ft)\n       =\u221a(A_k^2+B_k^2) cos(\u03d1_k+2\u03c9_ft_b-2\u03c9_ft) ,\n\nwith\n\n    A_k   =2[1/\u03c9_i d_k^(1)(t_b) \u1e0b_k^(1)(t_b)+\u03c9_i d_k^(2)(t) \u1e0b_k^(2)(t)] ,\n    \n    \tB_k   =[1/\u03c9_f\u03c9_i \u1e0b_k^(1)2(t_b)+\u03c9_i/\u03c9_f \u1e0b_k^(2)2(t_b)-\u03c9_f/\u03c9_i d_k^(1)2(t_b)-\u03c9_f\u03c9_i d_k^(2)2(t_b)] .\n\nand\n\n    cos\u03d1_k   =B_k/\u221a(A_k^2+B_k^2) ,   sin\u03d1_k   =-A_k/\u221a(A_k^2+B_k^2) .\n\nFrom (<ref>) and (<ref>), we see \u221a(A_k^2+B_k^2) is proportional to sinh2\u03b7_k, and thus is a time-independent constant. We immediately can identify \u03d1_k in Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) to be the same \u03b8_k in (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>). Finally, we may note that (<ref>) still looks slightly different from the lefthand sides of (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) in the arguments of the trigonometric functions. It results from the choice of the out mode function in (<ref>). The reason for such a choice is that for an observer in the out-region, he has no reference to identify the origin of time coordinate. In addition, the choice of a fixed time origin at most amounts to an absolute phase, which in most cases is of no significance. However, in the current case we are comparing two formalisms. So for   consistency's sake, we may define the origin of the time coordinate in the out-region at t_b rather than 0. Simply shifting t in (<ref>) to t\u2192 t-t_b,   then (<ref>) will look the same as those in (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>). At this point, we have shown that in the out-region an observer may report on having experienced a quantum field in a squeezed thermal state, with a time-independent squeeze parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe squeeze parameter \u03b7_k we showed earlier is quite small because cosh2\u03b7_k\u223c1. This results from the fact that the parametric processes in the previous cases vary mildly. Now we show a case similar to that in Fig.\u00a0<ref> but with a much sharper transition with \u03c9_i=1, \u03c9_f=100, t_a=3\u03c0/2, t_b=3\u03c0/2+0.05 and n=1. The plot for cosh2\u03b7_k is shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. We see in this case cosh2\u03b7_k=25.62206 in the out-region, much larger than the previous two cases. Therefore, it is consistent with the understanding that to generate large squeezing, the parametric process had better not be adiabatic.  This is corroborated by our prior knowledge of cosmological particle production.\n\n\nFinally,  as a contrast to the previous piecewise-continuous parametric processes, we consider a sufficiently smooth \u03c9^2(t), such as the thrice differentiable function \u03c9^2(t) \n\n    \u03c9^2(t)=-(t-t_a)^4/(t_b-t_a)^7[20t^3-10(7t_b^-t_a^) t^2+4(21t_b^2-7t_b^t_a^+t_a^2) t-(35t_b^3-21t_b^2t_a^+7t_b^t_a^2-t_a^3)] ,\n\nbetween t=t_a and t=t_b. The corresponding results are shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. We do not discern any difference in the generic behavior, so for the quantities of interest in our present  study, the piecewise-continuous \u03c9^2(t) suffices.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the squeeze parameter becomes time-independent in the out-region implies that this result is time-translation invariant. To be more precise, if we shift the parametric process along the time axis, then as long as the conditions that 1) the observation time t is still in the out-region of the shifted process and 2) the initial time t_i remains in the in-region of the shifted process, are satisfied, the observer at time t will still see the same squeeze parameter. In other words, the observer in the out-region cannot extract from the squeeze parameter any information about when the parametric process starts or ends. At first, it sounds odd that there exists such a time-translation  invariance for a nonequilibrium, nonstationary process. We show this in Appendix\u00a0<ref>; however, after seeing these examples, this result may not appear that dubious. The full evolution from the initial time t_i to the observation time t is not invariant under time translation, but after the parametric process has ended at t_b, the mode functions in the out-region reverts to  a  sinusoidal time dependence. The time translation in a sinusoidal function of time amounts to a phase shift.  Thus, if the  quantity of interest is independent of this phase shift, it appears to possess time-translation invariance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough in the current configuration the detector in the out-region will sense the same squeeze parameter when the parametric process is shifted along the time axis, the measured results in the detector still depend on the duration t_b-t_a and the functional form of the process. In fact this can be expected from (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>), where the squeeze parameters are expressed in terms of the fundamental solutions, which in turn depend on the functional form of the parametric process in their equation of motion. \n\n\n\n\nFor illustrations, Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(c) shows the dependence of the squeeze parameter \u03b7_k on the duration of the parametric process, given by Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). We fix the starting time t_a of the parametric process and the moment t the measurement in the out-region is performed. We find that the squeeze parameter \u03b7_k, defined in (<ref>), is oscillatory but decreases with increasing ending time t_b. Except for the small oscillations, the curve in (c) gives the general trend that the squeezing (as manifested, e.g., in particle pair production), is subdued with a slower transition rate or longer transition duration t_b-t_a. This example shows that this kind of parametric process gives a lower production of particles as it moves toward the adiabatic regime. The mild oscillations may be related to the kinks at t_a and t_b due to the nonsmoothness of \u03c9(t). This may be seen from the observation that the oscillations, as shown in the blow-ups in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(c), appear shallower with larger t_b-t_a because the kinks are less abrupt. This argument also find its support from Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(b) and -(d). \n\n\nIn Fig.\u00a0<ref>, the dependence of the squeeze parameter \u03b7_k on the functional form of the parametric process is shown. We choose three different parametric processes of \u03c9^2(t) for examples. In Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a), the process has the piecewise-continuous form given by Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), so it gives a same result as Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(c). Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(b) is described by the smooth transition, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). We have the same process, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), for Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(c) and -(d) but with different choices of n. We choose n=11 for (c) and n=1 for (d). Thus in plot (c) the transition does not monotonically vary with time. \n\n\n\nSince both Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(b) and -(d) are associated with smooth parametric processes, when we prolong the duration of the parametric processes by fixing t_a and increasing t_b, we see that the value of \u03b7_k monotonically decreases without any ripples. Thus, together with the behavior of the curve in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(c), they imply that the ripples in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a) may originate from the non-smoothness of the parametric process at the transition times t_a and t_b.\n\n\nAmong the plots in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(c) shows a more interesting behavior. The transition described by (<ref>) with n=11 is sinusoidal, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a). The squeeze parameter \u03b7_k in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(c) then reveals more structures, and may signify the presence of resonance, shown by a large peak. It seems to imply that the particle production can be greatly enhanced if the transition duration is tuned to the right value for fixed \u03c9_i and \u03c9_f, as in parametric resonance. This  may constitute  a mechanism to generate stronger squeezing, in addition to the common one  in a runaway setting\u00a0<cit.>. Another unusual feature  is that \u03b7_k in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(c) is not significantly reduced when we have a larger t_b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, this resonance feature can be traced back to parametric instability. If we write the equation of motion for a parametric oscillator with the frequency given by (<ref>) into the canonical form\n\n    x\u201d(\u03c4)+[a-2q cos(2\u03c4)] x(\u03c4)=0 ,\n\nwhere a prime represents taking the derivative with respect to \u03c4,  \u03a9  t=2\u03c4, and\n\n    a   =4A^2/\u03a9^2 ,   q   =2B^2/\u03a9^2 ,   \u03a9   =n\u03c0/t_b-t_a ,   A^2   =\u03c9_f^2+\u03c9_i^2/2 ,   B^2   =\u03c9_f^2-\u03c9_i^2/2 .\n\nNow compare the stability diagram Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a) of (<ref>) with Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(c). We immediately see that the portion of the curve in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(b) that corresponds to exceptionally high squeezing is essentially located within the unstable region (white area) of the stability diagram in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a). Thus, the large squeezing in the mode driven by a non-monotonic \u03c9(t) is caused by instability in parametric resonance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above simple examples illustrate a point that the dependence of the squeeze parameter \u03b7_k on the duration of the parametric process does reflect qualitative features of the parametric process. In fact, we can apply the same idea to the spectral dependence of the squeeze parameter for various functional forms of the parametric processes. These will serve as templates from which we may extract qualitative information about the parametric process the quantum field has experienced. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SUMMARY\n\n\nA major task of theoretical cosmology is to find ways to deduce the state of the early universe from relics observed today such as features of primordial radiation and matter contents. In addition to particle creation at the Planck time and structure formation after the GUT (grand unified theory) time we add here another fundamental quantum process: quantum radiation from atoms induced by of quantum fields.\n\n\n\nA massless quantum field in Minkowski space is subjected to a parametric process which varies the frequencies of the normal modes of the field from one constant value to another over a finite time interval. The initial (in-) state of the field will become squeezed after the process. In the out-region we couple an atom to this field in the out-state; the response of the atom certainly depends on this squeezing. Meanwhile, the radiation generated by the interacting atom will send out signals outwards, such that an observer or a probe at a much later time may still be able to identify the squeezing via the signatures in the radiation.\n\nOnce we have identified the squeezing, locally or remotely, we then ask how the squeezing may depend on the details of the parametric process the field had been subjected to. If we can work out templates that relate these quantities, then measurements of certain features of squeezing can tell us something about the parametric process.\n\nThe salient points in our results are summarized below. In the first part of this paper we show the following:\n\n    \n  * The radiation field at a location far away from the atom looks stationary; its nonstationary component decays with time exponentially fast.\n    \n  * The  net energy flow cancels at late times like the case discussed in\u00a0<cit.>. These features are of particular interest considering that the atom that emits this radiation is coupled to a squeezed field, which is nonstationary by nature. However they are consistent with the fact that the atom's internal dynamics relaxes in time.\n    \n  * This implies that we are unable to measure the extent of squeezing by measuring the net radiation energy flow at a location  far away from the atom.\n    \n  * On the other hand, one can receive residual radiation energy density at late times, which is a time-independent constant and is related to the squeeze parameter. But it is of a near-field nature, so the observer cannot be located too far away from the atom.\n\nNote that there is always an ambient free component of the same squeezed quantum field everywhere, in addition to the above radiation component generated by the atom's internal motion. \n\n In the second part of this paper we focus on the dependence of the squeeze parameter on the parametric process  and obtain these results:\n\n    \n  * Formally it can be shown that the squeeze parameter depends on the evolution of the field in the parametric process.\n    \n  * In the current configuration, for a given parametric process, the squeeze parameter depends only on the duration of the process, it does not depend on the starting or the ending time of the process.\n    \n  * In general, for a monotonically varying process, the value of the squeeze parameter decreases with increasing duration of the process.\n    \n  * This implies that, for an adiabatic parametric process, the squeezing tends to be very small, but it can be quite significant for non-adiabatic parametric processes. These results are consistent with studies of cosmological particle creation in the 70s as parametric amplification of vacuum fluctuations.\n    \n  * If the parametric process changes with time sinusoidally, then the dependence of the squeeze parameter on the duration of the process shows interesting additional structures. For certain lengths of the process, the squeeze parameter can have unusually large values.\n    \n  * This non-monotonic behavior turns out to be related to parametric instability. The resulting large squeeze parameter is caused by the choice of the parameter that falls within the unstable regime of the parametric process.\n\nOur results in this second part indicate that not much information about a monotonic parametric process can be gleaned off from the squeeze parameter. On the other hand, for a non-monotonic parametric process, the squeeze parameter shows nontrivial dependence on the duration of the process. The latter is expected to be the typical case in nature in which various scales are involved in a transition.  Moreover, to conform to realistic measurements, we can apply similar considerations to examine the mode dependence of the squeeze parameter. Thus the current scenario seems to offer a viable means to extract partial information about the parametric process a quantum field has undergone.\n\n\n\n\nAs a final remark, we comment on applying the discussions in Sec.\u00a0<ref> to the case of the atom coupled to quantized electromagnetic fields. To begin with, in conventional sense, such a configuration has a supra-Ohmic, Markovian dynamics. It is inherently unstable, as discussed in\u00a0<cit.>. It has runaway solutions, so it makes no sense to discuss the late time  behavior, relaxation, energy balance or the fluctuation-dissipation relation of such a system. Although we may render such a system to have stable dynamics by resorting to order reduction\u00a0<cit.> via the critical manifold argument, this approach is not very satisfactory from the viewpoint of  open systems because order reduction only asymmetrically changes the behavior of the dissipation on the atom side; it does not accordingly modify the fluctuation noise force on the atom. Thus the resulting nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation associated with the atom's internal dynamics will not take the elegant form we usually see for the Ohmic, Markovian dynamics. Furthermore this relation will depend on the parameters of the reduced system, and thus loses its universality for  interacting linear systems and for some nonlinear systems. \n\nTo restore the stable dynamics of the atom's internal dynamics\u00a0<cit.> and the beauty of the associated nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation, it is probably easiest if we generalize the Markovian spectrum of the quantized electromagnetic field to the non-Markovian one.  However this introduces additional complexity to the analysis presented in Sec.\u00a0<ref> because the radiation field will not have a simple local (apart from retardation) form like (<ref>). Thus it is not clear yet whether the rather general properties we expounded in Sec.\u00a0<ref> for a quantum scalar field also convey to a quantized electromagnetic field, a topic saved for future investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgment J.-T.

The creation and annihilation operators satisfy the standard commutation relation [\u00e2,\u00e2^\u2020]=1. It is convenient to put the squeeze parameter \u03b6 into a polar form \u03b6=\u03b7 e^i\u03b8, with \u03b7\u2208\u211d^+ and 0\u2264\u03b8<2\u03c0.

Both the two single-mode squeezed state and the two-squeezed state are connected. We first write two modes in terms of their normal modes i=\u00b1,\n\n    \u00e2_1   =\u00e2_++\u00e2_-/\u221a(2) ,   \u00e2_2   =\u00e2_+-\u00e2_-/\u221a(2) ,\n\nwith [\u00e2_+,\u00e2_-]=0. Then we can write the two-mode squeeze operator \u015c_2, (<ref>), as\n\n    \u015c_2   =exp[\u03b6^*/2(\u00e2_+^+\u00e2_-^)(\u00e2_+^-\u00e2_-^)-\u03b6/2 (\u00e2_+^\u2020+\u00e2_-^\u2020)(\u00e2_+^\u2020-\u00e2_-^\u2020)]\n       =exp[\u03b6^*/2 \u00e2_+^2-\u03b6/2 \u00e2_+^\u20202]\u00d7exp[-\u03b6^*/2 \u00e2_-^2+\u03b6/2 \u00e2_-^\u20202]\n       =\u015c_\u00e2_+(\u03b6)\u00d7\u015c_\u00e2_-(-\u03b6) .\n\nThat is, in terms of the normal modes, it can be decomposed into a product of two single-mode squeezed operators.\n\n\nIn the current setting the connection is even closer because the pair of modes in \u015c_2 have the opposite momenta \u00b1k. Since the two-mode squeeze operator \u015c_2, (<ref>), symmetrically contains the annihilation and the creation operators of both modes, during the mode counting, contributions from each pair (k,-k) will appear twice, and the resulting expressions may look like that given by two single-mode squeezed state. For example, let us compute the Hadamard function of the scalar field \u03d5 in the two-mode squeezed thermal state in spatially isotropic spacetime,\n\n    G_H,0^(\u03d5)(x,x')   =\u222bd^3k/(2\u03c0)^3/21/\u221a([b]2\u03c9)\u222bd^3k'/(2\u03c0)^3/21/\u221a(2\u03c9')[ 1/2 \u27e8{\u00e2_k^, \u00e2_k'^}\u27e9_tmst e^ik\u00b7x+ik'\u00b7x'e^-i\u03c9 t-i\u03c9't'.\n                                     +.1/2 \u27e8{\u00e2_k^, \u00e2_k'^\u2020}\u27e9_tmst e^ik\u00b7x-ik'\u00b7x'e^-i\u03c9 t+i\u03c9't'+H.C.]\n       =\u222bd^3k/(2\u03c0)^31/2\u03c9 [ 1/2 \u27e8{\u00e2_k^, \u00e2_k^}\u27e9_tmst e^ik\u00b7(x+x')e^-i\u03c9(t+t')+1/2 \u27e8{\u00e2_k^, \u00e2_-k^}\u27e9_tmst e^ik\u00b7(x-x')e^-i\u03c9 (t+t').\n                   +1/2 \u27e8{\u00e2_k^, \u00e2_k^\u2020}\u27e9_tmst e^ik\u00b7(x-x')e^-i\u03c9 (t-t')+1/2 \u27e8{\u00e2_k^, \u00e2_-k^\u2020}\u27e9_tmst e^ik\u00b7(x+x')e^-i\u03c9 (t-t')\n                               +.H.C.]\n       =\u222bd^3k/(2\u03c0)^31/2\u03c9 e^ik\u00b7(x-x')[(n_\u03c9+1/2) cosh2\u03b7_\u03c9 e^-i\u03c9(t-t')-e^i\u03b8_\u03c9(n_\u03c9+1/2) sinh2\u03b7_\u03c9 e^-i\u03c9(t+t').\n                               +.H.C.] ,\n\nwith \u03c9=|k| and the help of (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>). This is the same as the Hadamard function of the field in the squeezed thermal state, consistent with (<ref>). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 LATE-TIME BEHAVIOR OF \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Late-Time Energy Flux Density \n\nHere we will examine the late-time net radiation flux of the field at distance r sufficiently far away from the atom, so that only the dominant contribution, independent r, will be of our interest. The energy flux density is given by\n\n    \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_rt(x)\u27e9 = lim_x' \u2192 x\u2202^2/\u2202 r \u2202 t'[  G^(\u03d5)_H (x,x') - G^(\u03d5)_H, 0(x,x') ] .\n\n We first look at the stationary component.\n\n\n \n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 stationary component \n\nWe will assume that t\u226b r, but place no other restrictions on r for the moment. Following the decomposition in (<ref>), the stationary part of the contribution purely from the radiation field is given by\n\n    lim_x' \u2192 x\u2202^2/\u2202 r \u2202 t'1/2\u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_br(x), \u03d5\u0302_br(x') }\u27e9_st= -e^2\u222b_-\u221e^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 \u03c9^2  G^(\u03c7)_H(\u03c9) |G^(\u03d5)_R, 0(x; \u03c9)|^2 ,\n\nwith the help of\n\n    \u2202/\u2202 rG^(\u03d5)_R, 0(x; \u03c9)   =(i\u03c9-1/r) G^(\u03d5)_R, 0(x; \u03c9) ,\n    \u2202/\u2202 rG^(\u03d5),st_H, 0(x; \u03c9)   =cosh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2[\u03c9 ReG^(\u03d5)_R, 0(x; \u03c9)-1/r ImG^(\u03d5)_R, 0(x; \u03c9)] ,\n\nwhere the stationary part of the free-field Hadamard function is\n\n    G^(\u03d5),st_H, 0(x,0; \u03c9)\u2261G^(\u03d5),st_H, 0(x; \u03c9)=cosh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2 sin\u03c9 r/4\u03c0 r .\n\nTo arrive at Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), we observe the term proportional to r^-1 is odd in \u03c9, thus, vanishing, and that ReG^(\u03c7)_R(\u03c9) is an even function of \u03c9. At time greater than the relaxation time scale we may make the identification \n\n    G^(\u03c7)_H(\u03c9)=cosh 2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2 ImG^(\u03c7)_R(\u03c9) ,\n\nby the nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation\u00a0<cit.> of the internal dynamics of the atom if initially it is coupled to a squeezed thermal field. \n\n\nOn the other hand, for the cross-term, containing the correlation between the radiation field and the free field at large distance from the atom, its stationary part is\n\n    lim_x' \u2192 x\u2202^2/\u2202 r \u2202 t'1/2[\u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_h(x), \u03d5\u0302_br(x')}\u27e9_st + \u27e8{\u03d5\u0302_br(x), \u03d5\u0302_h(x')}\u27e9_st]\n       =-i e^2 \u222b_-\u221e^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 \u03c9^2 \u03c1^(st)(\u03c9) G^(\u03c7)_R(\u03c9) |G^(\u03d5)_R, 0(x; \u03c9)|^2 .\n\nHereafter it is convenient to introduce the shorthand notations\n\n    \u03c1^(st)(\u03c9)=cosh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2 ,       and   \u03c1^(ns)(\u03c9)=sinh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2 .\n\nSince the contribution from ReG^(\u03c7)_R(\u03c9) is an even function of \u03c9, we immediately see it is the opposite of (<ref>) by (<ref>), and thus cancels with (<ref>). We already know from the case of the unsqueezed thermal state that the corresponding contributions of (<ref>) and (<ref>) cancel with one another. Therefore here we have shown that at late times the stationary part of the net energy flux density far away from the atom vanishes even though the field is initially in the squeezed thermal state, a nonstationary configuration. \n\nHere it is worth emphasizing the significance of vanishing stationary component of the net radiation flux. This is a unique feature of self-consistent quantum dynamics. The cancellation between (<ref>) and (<ref>) is not possible if the radiated field \u03d5_r(x) is not correlated with the free field \u03d5_h(x). This correlation is established because the atom that sends out the radiation field is driven by a free field, as seen by the Langevin equation (<ref>). It still holds when the field state is a vacuum state\u00a0<cit.>, so a pure classical system will not have such correlation. Secondly our system is distinct from the classical driven dipole because the latter has a net outward radiation flux supplied by the external driving agent and is then independent of the field state. This is best seen from the component (<ref>) of the flux that is solely composed of the radiation field. This flux is field-state dependent because the internal dynamics of the atom is driven by the quantum fluctuations of the field, rather than an external agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 nonstationary component \n\nNow we turn to the nonstationary contribution in \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_rt(x)\u27e9.

However, in Appendix\u00a0<ref>, we can argue that although Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>) and\u00a0(<ref>) do not cancel in general, their sum still decays with time and furthermore it actually falls off to zero exponentially fast, proportional to e^-2\u03b3 t.\n\nThus combining the discussions about the stationary component, we show that at late times no net radiation flux exudes to spatial infinity from a static atom even though the internal degree of freedom of the atom is driven by the quantum fluctuations of the squeezed field caused by its parametric process. At late times it leaves no trace of detectable signal to a detector at distance much greater than the typical scales in the atom's internal dynamics, except for the case of extremely large squeezing where we might have the chance to see a trace of the net flux since it will take a longer time to decay.

The dominant contribution of the stationary component of the local field energy density vanishes, so Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is subdominant since it is proportional to 1/r^3. It comes from the correlation between the radiation field and the free field at the location far away from the atom, and it decays faster with r. Note that there are two type of 1/r^3 contributions in the cross terms (<ref>) but one of them cancels with its counterpart in (<ref>). The residual energy density (<ref>) has relatively short range by nature. We note it is proportional to e^2, which is proportional to the damping constant \u03b3.

Thus the continuity equation is satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 LATE-TIME BEHAVIOR OF THE NONSTATIONARY CONTRIBUTION IN \n\nIt turns out that the nonstationary contribution in \u27e8\u0394T\u0302_rt(x)\u27e9 still decays with time. To begin with, it proves useful to quote the late-time expressions of the energy exchange between the atom and the surrounding field\u00a0<cit.>. For times greater than the relation time, the nonstationary contribution of the energy flow into the atom from field has the form\n\n    P_\u03be^(ns)(t)   =i e^2\u222b_0^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 \u03c9^2/4\u03c0 sinh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2{G_R^(\u03c7)(\u03c9) e^-i2\u03c9 t+i\u03b8-C.C.} ,and the corresponding contribution of the energy flow out of the atom due to friction is\n        P_\u03b3^(ns)(t)   =-e^4\u222b_0^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 \u03c9^3/(4\u03c0)^2 sinh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2 {[G_R^(\u03c7)(\u03c9)]^2 e^-i2\u03c9 t+i\u03b8+C.C.} .\n\nFor comparison, let us put the terms proportional to \u03c9 inside of the curly brackets of (<ref>) and (<ref>) here,\n\n    (<ref>)   :      i e^2\u222b_0^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 \u03c9^2/(4\u03c0)^2r^2 sinh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2{G_R^(\u03c7)(\u03c9) e^-i2\u03c9 (t-r)+i\u03b8-C.C.} ,\n    (<ref>)   :      -e^4\u222b_0^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 \u03c9^3/(4\u03c0)^3r^2 sinh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2{[G^(\u03c7)_R(\u03c9)]^2 e^-i2\u03c9 (t-r)+i\u03b8+C.C.} .\n\nWe see correspondence between (<ref>) and (<ref>), as well as between (<ref>) and (<ref>). For example, the integrand of (<ref>) is e^i2\u03c9 r4\u03c0 r^2 times the integrand of (<ref>). The same applies to the (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) pair. For a fix r and at times t\u226b r, we may shift or re-define t in (<ref>) and (<ref>) by t-r\u2192 t such that the integrals in both equations are essentially proportional to those in (<ref>) and (<ref>). We have numerically shown in\u00a0<cit.> that (<ref>) and (<ref>) vanish as t\u2192\u221e, so we conclude that the terms proportional to \u03c9 inside of the curly brackets of (<ref>) and (<ref>) will also vanish at late times. For example, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref> generated by numerical calculations, the contribution in (<ref>) actually decays exponentially fast to zero. \n \n\n\n\nFor terms which are proportional to 1/r inside of the curly brackets of (<ref>) and (<ref>), we immediately see that if we take the time derivative of (<ref>), we obtain an expression which is 2/r times (<ref>). Likewise, the time derivative of (<ref>) gives,\n\n    2/r\u00d7 i e^2\u222b_0^\u221ed\u03c9/2\u03c0 \u03c9^2/(4\u03c0)^2r^2 sinh2\u03b7 \u03b2\u03c9/2{G_R^(\u03c7)(\u03c9) [e^-i2\u03c9 (t-r)+i\u03b8-e^-i2\u03c9 t+i\u03b8]-C.C.} .\n\nFollowing the previous arguments, for a fixed r, it vanishes in the limit t\u2192\u221e too. Thus we have demonstrated that the time derivatives of the terms proportional to 1/r inside of the curly brackets of (<ref>) and (<ref>) vanishes, so these terms must be constants for sufficiently large time. On the other hand, these terms are time dependent and are not sign definite, so the asymptotic constants must be zero.\n\n\nPutting these results together, we reach the conclusion that the nonstationary terms of the net radiation flux vanishes eventually at large distance away from the atom. However it does tell how slowly the nonstationary term decay. In fact, at least for the zero temperature limit \u03b2\u2192\u221e, we can carry out the above integrals analytically, and the brute-force calculations show that for fixed r, these integrals give results that decay exponentially fast to zero in a form proportional to sinh 2\u03b7 e^-2\u03b3 t. Thus at late times, no net radiation energy flux leaks to the spatial infinity from the atom even though the internal degree of freedom of the atom is coupled to a nonstationary squeezed quantum field. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 TIME-TRANSLATIONAL INVARIANCE OF THE SQUEEZE PARAMETER IN THE OUT-REGION\n\nNext we argue that if we shift the parametric process by \u0394 along the time axis, as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, then we will have\n\n    \ud835\uddbd_i^(ii)(t+\u0394,t_a+\u0394)=d_i^(ii)(t,t_a)\n\nwhere \ud835\uddbd_i^(ii)(t+\u0394,t_a+\u0394) on sans serif style is the fundamental solution in-region II for the shifted case described by the orange curve in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. \n\n\n\n\nSince the fundamental solutions \ud835\uddbd_i^(ii)(y,y_a) in-region II for the orange curve satisfies the equation of motion\n\n    \ud835\uddbd\u0308_i^(ii)(y,y_a)+\u03c9^2(y) \ud835\uddbd_i^(ii)(y,y_a)=0 ,\n\nwith the standard initial conditions given at y_a=t_a+\u0394, while the fundamental solutions d_i^(ii)(y,y_a) in-region II for the blue curve satisfies the equation of motion\n\n    d\u0308_i^(ii)(t,t_a)+\u03c9^2(t) d_i^(ii)(t,t_a)=0 ,\n\nwith the standard initial conditions given at t_a, we immediately see that both cases are related by y=t+\u0394, and thus we arrive at (<ref>) and in particular,\n\n    \ud835\uddbd_i^(ii)(t_b+\u0394,t_a+\u0394)=d_i^(ii)(t_b,t_a) .\n\nLater we will need this result.\n\n\n\nNow we would like to explicitly show that an detector, in the out-region with t>t_b+\u0394, will find the same squeeze parameter for both cases described in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, independent of the shift \u0394, even if it carries out the measurement at the same time t. Note that in both cases the motion starts at the same t_i=0. Following the previous discussions on the construction of the fundamental solutions, we carry out a similar construction of the fundamental solution for the shifted process. At t>t_b+\u0394. In particular, we focus on the moment t=t_b+\u0394 since afterward the squeeze parameter is a constant. Before we start, we first note that \ud835\uddbd_i^(i)(t) is essentially the same as d_i^(i)(t), except that the former applies to the time interval 0=t_i\u2264 t\u2264 t_a+\u0394 while the latter only to 0=t_i\u2264 t\u2264 t_a. With this recognition, we can write \ud835\uddbd_i^(i)(t_a+\u0394) as\n\n    \ud835\uddbd_i^(i)(t_a+\u0394)=d_1^(i)(\u0394) d_i^(i)(t_a)+d_2^(i)(\u0394) \u1e0b_i^(i)(t_a) .\n\nThis will be convenient later. Now we will write \ud835\uddbd_i(t_b+\u0394,0) in terms d_i^(x) with X=I, II, and III of the unshifted process. We show the calculations explicitly for \ud835\uddbd_1(t_b+\u0394), and the result for \ud835\uddbd_2(t_b+\u0394) will follow similarly. Pretty straightforwardly, we have\n\n\n\n\n    \ud835\uddbd_1(t_b+\u0394,0)   =\ud835\uddbd_1^(ii)(t_b+\u0394,t_a+\u0394) \ud835\uddbd_1^(i)(t_a+\u0394)+\ud835\uddbd_2^(ii)(t_b+\u0394,t_a+\u0394) \ud835\uddbd\u0307_1^(i)(t_a+\u0394)\n       =d_1^(ii)(t_b,t_a)[d_1^(i)(\u0394) d_1^(i)(t_a)+d_2^(i)(\u0394) \u1e0b_1^(i)(t_a)]+d_2^(ii)(t_b,t_a)[\u1e0b_1^(i)(\u0394) d_1^(i)(t_a)+\u1e0b_2^(i)(\u0394) \u1e0b_1^(i)(t_a)]\n\nwith the help of (<ref>) and (<ref>). We use a trick that only applies to the undamped harmonic oscillator. in-region I, we have the identities\n\n    \u1e0b_2^(i)(t)   =d_1^(i)(t) ,      \u21d2   d_2^(i)(\u0394) \u1e0b_1^(i)(t_a)   =d_2^(i)(t_a) \u1e0b_1^(i)(\u0394) ,\n\nand it allows us to re-write (<ref>),\n\n    \ud835\uddbd_1(t_b+\u0394,0)   =d_1^(ii)(t_b,t_a)[d_1^(i)(\u0394) d_1^(i)(t_a)+\u1e0b_1^(i)(\u0394) d_2^(i)(t_a)]+d_2^(ii)(t_b,t_a)[\u1e0b_1^(i)(\u0394) d_1^(i)(t_a)+d_1^(i)(\u0394) \u1e0b_1^(i)(t_a)]\n       =[d_1^(ii)(t_b,t_a) d_1^(i)(t_a)+d_2^(ii)(t_b,t_a) \u1e0b_1^(i)(t_a)] d_1^(i)(\u0394)+[d_1^(ii)(t_b,t_a) d_2^(i)(t_a)+d_2^(ii)(t_b,t_a) d_1^(i)(t_a)] \u1e0b_1^(i)(\u0394)\n       =d_1(t_b,0) d_1^(i)(\u0394)+d_2(t_b,0) \u1e0b_1^(i)(\u0394) .\n\nSimilarly for \ud835\uddbd_2(t_b+\u0394,0), we have\n\n    \ud835\uddbd_2(t_b+\u0394,0)=d_1(t_b,0) d_2^(i)(\u0394)+d_2(t_b,0) \u1e0b_2^(i)(\u0394) .\n\nNow we plug these results into the expressions in (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) to find the corresponding squeeze parameter in-region III,\n\n    1/\u03c9_f\u03c9_i \ud835\uddbd\u0307_k^(1)2(t_b+\u0394)+\u03c9_i/\u03c9_f \ud835\uddbd\u0307_k^(2)2(t_b+\u0394)+\u03c9_f/\u03c9_i \ud835\uddbd_k^(1)2(t_b+\u0394)+\u03c9_f\u03c9_i \ud835\uddbd_k^(2)2(t_b+\u0394)\n                           =1/\u03c9_f\u03c9_i \u1e0b_k^(1)2(t_b)+\u03c9_i/\u03c9_f \u1e0b_k^(2)2(t_b)+\u03c9_f/\u03c9_i d_k^(1)2(t_b)+\u03c9_f\u03c9_i d_k^(2)2(t_b) ,\n       1/\u03c9_f\u03c9_i \ud835\uddbd\u0307_k^(1)2(t_b+\u0394)+\u03c9_i/\u03c9_f \ud835\uddbd\u0307_k^(2)2(t_b+\u0394)-\u03c9_f/\u03c9_i \ud835\uddbd_k^(1)2(t_b+\u0394)-\u03c9_f\u03c9_i \ud835\uddbd_k^(2)2(t_b+\u0394)\n                           =1/\u03c9_f\u03c9_i \u1e0b_k^(1)2(t_b)+\u03c9_i/\u03c9_f \u1e0b_k^(2)2(t_b)-\u03c9_f/\u03c9_i d_k^(1)2(t_b)-\u03c9_f\u03c9_i d_k^(2)2(t_b) ,\n       1/\u03c9_i \ud835\uddbd_k^(1)(t_b+\u0394)\ud835\uddbd\u0307_k^(1)(t_b+\u0394)+\u03c9_i \ud835\uddbd_k^(2)(t_b+\u0394)\ud835\uddbd\u0307_k^(2)(t_b+\u0394)\n                           =1/\u03c9_i d_k^(1)(t_b)\u1e0b_k^(1)(t_b)+\u03c9_i d_k^(2)(t_b)\u1e0b_k^(2)(t_b) ,\n\ndue to the facts that\n\n    d_1^(i)(\u0394) \u1e0b_1^(i)(\u0394)   =-\u03c9_i^2d_2^(i)(\u0394) \u1e0b_2^(i)(\u0394) ,   d_1^(i)2(\u0394)+\u03c9_i^2d_2^(i)2(\u0394)   =1 ,   1/\u03c9_i^2 \u1e0b_1^(i)2(\u0394)+\u1e0b_2^(i)2(\u0394)   =1 .\n\nThe results for the shifted process are the same as those for un-shifted process. Thus both cases generate the same squeezing at t\u2265 t_b+\u0394.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n99\n\n\nUnr76 \n\tW. G. Unruh, Notes on black-hole evaporation, Phys. Rev.
