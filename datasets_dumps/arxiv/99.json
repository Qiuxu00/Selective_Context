But it remains challenging to estimate the distillable entanglement and its closely related essential quantity, the quantum capacity of a noisy quantum channel. In this work, we propose methods for evaluating both quantities by squeezing out useless entanglement within a state or a quantum channel, whose contributions are expected to be ignored for the distillable entanglement or the quantum capacity, respectively. We first consider a general resource measure called the reverse divergence of resources to quantify the minimum divergence between a target state and the set of free states. We then introduce the reverse max-relative entropy of entanglement and apply it to establish efficiently computable upper bounds on the distillable entanglement. We also extend the reverse divergence of resources to quantum channels and derive upper bounds on the quantum capacity. We further apply our method to investigate purifying the maximally entangled states under practical noises, such as depolarizing and amplitude damping noises, and notably establish improvements in estimating the one-way distillable entanglement. Our bounds also offer useful benchmarks for evaluating the quantum capacities of qubit quantum channels of interest, including the Pauli channels and the random mixed unitary channels.\n\n\n\nEstimate distillable entanglement and quantum capacity by squeezing useless entanglement\n    Xin Wang\n    March 30, 2023\n========================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Background\n\nQuantum entanglement is the most nonclassical manifestation of quantum mechanics and has become a key ingredient in many quantum information processing tasks, e.g., teleportation\u00a0<cit.>, superdense coding\u00a0<cit.>, and quantum cryptography\u00a0<cit.>. More specifically, the entanglement resource is usually assumed to be copies of the maximally entangled states. In a practical scenario, noises inevitably occur in quantum states, resulting in some mixed entangled states, which leads to the need for distillation or purification. A natural question is how to obtain the maximally entangled states from a source of less entangled states using well-motivated operations, known as the entanglement distillation.\n\nOne fundamental measure for characterizing the entanglement distillation is the one-way distillable entanglement\u00a0<cit.>, denoted by E_D,\u2192, which is also one of the most important entanglement measures motivated by operational tasks. It captures the highest rate at which one can obtain the maximally entangled states from less entangled states by one-way local operations and classical communication (LOCC):\n\n    E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB)=sup{r:lim_n \u2192\u221e [inf_\u039b\u039b(\u03c1_AB^ n)- \u03a6(2^rn)_1]=0},\n\nwhere \u039b ranges over one-way LOCC operations and \u03a6(d)=1/d\u2211_i,j=1^d |ii\u27e9\u27e8jj| is the standard d\u2297 d maximally entangled state. Likewise, the two-way distillable entanglement E_D,\u2194(\u03c1_AB) is defined by the supremum over all achievable rates under two-way LOCC. We have for all bipartite states \u03c1_AB that E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) \u2264 E_D,\u2194(\u03c1_AB). Notably, the distillable entanglement turns out to be closely related to the central idea of quantum capacity in quantum communication tasks, which is central to quantum Shannon theory. Consider modelling the noise in transmitting quantum information from Alice to Bob as a quantum channel _A\u2192 B. The quantum capacity Q(_A\u2192 B) is the maximal achievable rate at which Alice can reliably transmit quantum information to Bob by asymptotically many uses of the channel. By the state\u2013channel duality, if the distillation protocol of the Choi state\u00a0<cit.> J_AB^ of _A\u2192 B yields the maximally entangled states at a positive rate, then Alice may apply the standard teleportation scheme to send arbitrary quantum states to Bob at the same rate. Thus, one has Q(_A\u2192 B) \u2265 E_D,\u2192(J_AB^) since classical forward communication in teleportation does not affect the channel capacity. For the teleportation-simulable channels\u00a0<cit.>, the equality here holds. Many recent works\u00a0<cit.> have studied the properties of quantum communication over quantum channels, e.g., non-additivity and superactivation, which determines the complexity of calculating the quantum capacity.\n\n \nDespite many efforts that have been made in the past two decades, computing E_D,\u2192(\u00b7) and Q(\u00b7) still generally remains a challenging task. Even for the qubit isotropic states and the depolarizing channels, it remains unsolved. Therefore, numerous studies try to estimate them by deriving lower and upper bounds (see, e.g.,\u00a0<cit.> for the distillable entanglement, e.g.,\u00a0<cit.> for the quantum capacity). For the distillable entanglement, a well-known lower bound dubbed Hashing bound is established by Devetak and Winter\u00a0<cit.>, i.e., E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) \u2265 I_(A\u27e9 B)_\u03c1, where I_(A\u27e9 B)_\u03c1 is the coherent information of the bipartite quantum state \u03c1_AB. Considering upper bounds, the Rains bound\u00a0<cit.> is arguably the best-known efficiently computable bound for the two-way distillable entanglement of general states, which can consequently be an upper bound of E_D,\u2192(\u00b7). Recent works\u00a0<cit.> utilize the techniques of finding upper bounds by constructing meaningful extended states. For quantum capacity, many useful upper bounds for general quantum channels are studied for benchmarking arbitrary quantum noise\u00a0<cit.>. When considering some specific classes of quantum channels, useful upper bounds are also developed to help us better understand quantum communication via these channels\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nIn specific, due to the regularization in the characterizations of E_D,\u2192(\u00b7) and Q(\u00b7), one main strategy to establish efficiently computable upper bounds on them is to develop single-letter formulae. For example, one common approach is to decompose a state (resp. a quantum channel) into degradable parts and anti-degradable parts\u00a0<cit.>, or use approximate degradability (anti-degradability)\u00a0<cit.>. Another recent fruitful technique called flag extension optimization\u00a0<cit.> relies on finding a degradable extension of the state or the quantum channel. However, the performance of these methods is limited by the absence of a good decomposition strategy. It is unknown how to partition a general state or quantum channel to add flags or how to construct a proper and meaningful convex decomposition on them. Thus, the flag extension optimization is only effective for the states and channels with symmetry or known structures.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Main contributions\n\nThis work considers a family of resource measures called reverse divergence of resources. \n\nWith a specific construction, we define the reverse max-relative entropy of entanglement for quantum states, which has applications for estimating the distillable entanglement. \nIn the meantime, we introduce reverse max-relative entropy of anti-degradability for quantum channels as a generalization of the concept of that for states, which can be applied to bound the quantum capacity. All these bounds can be efficiently computed via semidefinite programming\u00a0<cit.>. Furthermore, drawing on the idea of\u00a0<cit.>, we thoroughly analyze different continuity bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement of a state in terms of its anti-degradability. Finally, we investigate the distillation of the maximally entangled states under practical noises and focus on the quantum capacity of qubit channels. We show that the bound obtained by the reverse max-relative entropy of entanglement outperforms other known bounds in a high-noise region, including the Rains bound and the above continuity bounds. The upper bound offered by the reverse max-relative entropy of anti-degradability also provides an alternative interpretation of the no-cloning bound of the Pauli channel\u00a0<cit.>, and notably outperforms the continuity bounds on random unital qubit channels.\n\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. We start with some preliminaries used throughout the paper in section <ref>. In section <ref>, we introduce our conceptual contribution, a family of resource measures called the reverse divergence of resources. In section <ref>, we present the application of this concept on the distillable entanglement. Specifically, in subsection <ref>, we show how the reverse max-relative entropy of entanglement can be used to derive a useful upper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement. We derive different continuity bounds in subsection <ref>, with which we compare our bounds and the Rains bound by practical distillable states in subsection <ref>. We also extend our method to the two-way distillable entanglement in subsection\u00a0<ref>. In section <ref>, we show the application of our method in deriving upper bounds on quantum capacity. We establish some analytical results for Pauli channels and compare our bounds with continuity bounds in subsection\u00a0<ref> for random mixed unitary channels. In section <ref>, we conclude with a summary and some outlooks for future research.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 REVERSE DIVERGENCE OF RESOURCES\n \n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Preliminaries\n\nLet  be a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, and () be the set of linear operators acting on it. We consider two parties Alice and Bob with Hilbert space \u210b_A, \u210b_B, whose dimensions are d_A, d_B, respectively. A linear operator \u03c1\u2208() is called a density operator if it is Hermitian and positive semidefinite with trace one. We denote the trace norm of \u03c1 as \u03c1_1 = \u221a(\u03c1^\u2020\u03c1) and let () denote the set of density operators. We call a linear map CPTP if it is both completely positive and trace-preserving. A CPTP map that transforms linear operators in (_A) to linear operators in (_B) is also called a quantum channel, denoted as _A\u2192 B. For a quantum channel _A\u2192 B, its Choi-Jamio\u0142kowski state is given by J_AB^\u2261\u2211_i, j=0^d_A-1|i\u27e9\u27e8j|\ud835\udca9_A \u2192 B(|i\u27e9\u27e8j|), where {|i\u27e9}_i=0^d_A-1 is an orthonormal basis in _A. The von Neumann entropy of a state \u03c1_A is S(A)_\u03c1 := - (\u03c1_A log\u03c1_A) and the coherent information of a bipartite state \u03c1_AB is defined by I_c(A\u27e9 B)_\u03c1 := S(B)_\u03c1 - S(AB)_\u03c1. The entanglement of formation of a state \u03c1_AB is given by\n\n    E_F(\u03c1_AB) = min_{p_i, |\u03d5_i\u27e9}\u2211_i p_i S(A)_\u03d5_i,\n\nwhere \u03c1_AB=\u2211_i p_i |\u03d5_i\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5_i|_AB and the minimization ranges over all pure state decomposition of \u03c1_AB. We introduce the generalized divergence D(\u03c1_A \u03c3_A) as a map D: (_A)\u00d7(_A) \u21a6\u211d\u222a{+\u221e} that obeys:\n\n    \n  * Faithfulness: D(\u03c1_A \u03c3_A)=0 iff \u03c1_A = \u03c3_A.\n    \n  * Data processing inequality: D(\u03c1_A \u03c3_A) \u2265D[\ud835\udca9_A\u2192 A'(\u03c1_A) \ud835\udca9_A\u2192 A'(\u03c3_A)], where \ud835\udca9_A\u2192 A' is an arbitrary quantum channel.\n\nThe generalized divergence is intuitively some measure of distinguishability of the two states, e.g., Bures metric, quantum relative entropy. Another example of interest is the sandwiched R\u00e9nyi relative entropy\u00a0<cit.> of \u03c1, \u03c3 that is defined by\n\n    D_\u03b1(\u03c1\u03c3):=1/\u03b1-1logTr[(\u03c3^1-\u03b1/2 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c3^1-\u03b1/2 \u03b1)^\u03b1],\n\nif supp(\u03c1) \u2282supp(\u03c3) and it is equal to +\u221e otherwise, where \u03b1\u2208(0,1) \u222a(1, \u221e). In the case that \u03b1\u2192\u221e, one can find the max-relative entropy\u00a0<cit.> of \u03c1 with respect to \u03c3 by\n\n    D_max(\u03c1 || \u03c3) = inf{\u03bb\u2208\u211d: \u03c1\u2264 2^\u03bb\u03c3}.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Reverse divergence of resources\n\nIn the usual framework of quantum resource theories\u00a0<cit.>, there are two main notions: i) subset  of free states, i.e., the states that do not possess the given resource; ii) subset  of free operations, i.e., the quantum channels that are unable to generate the resource. Meanwhile, two axioms for a quantity being a resource measure (\u00b7) are essential:\n\n    \n  1). Vanishing for free states: \u03c1\u2208\u21d2(\u03c1) = 0.\n    \n  2). Monotonicity: ((\u03c1)) \u2264(\u03c1) for any free operation . (\u00b7) is called a resource monotone.\n\nLet us define a family of resource measures called reverse divergence of resources:\n\n    _\u2131(\u03c1_AB) := min_\u03c4\u2208\u2131D(\u03c4_AB||\u03c1_AB),\n\nwhere \u2131 is some set of free states. By the definition of the reverse divergence of resources in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), one can easily check it satisfies condition 1). Whenever the free state set  is closed, by the data-processing inequality of D(\u00b7\u00b7), condition 2) will be satisfied. Thus _\u2131(\u00b7) is a resource measure. Specifically, in the resource theory of entanglement, some representative free state sets are the separable states (SEP) and the states having a positive partial transpose (PPT). Examples of free sets of operations are LOCC and PPT. We note that the \"reverse\" here means minimizing the divergence over a free state set in the first coordinate, rather than the second one which has helped one define the relative entropy of entanglement\u00a0<cit.> and the max-relative entropy of entanglement\u00a0<cit.>. For some divergence of particular interest, e.g., the quantum relative entropy D(\u00b7||\u00b7), relevant discussion of the coordinate choices can be traced back to work in\u00a0<cit.>. In <cit.>, the authors further studied properties of the quantity min_\u03c4\u2208D(\u03c4||\u03c1). Here, we try to further investigate meaningful applications of some reverse divergence of resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following, we consider the generalized divergence as the max-relative entropy and study a measure called reverse max-relative entropy of resources,\n\n    _max,\u2131(\u03c1_AB) := min_\u03c4\u2208\u2131D_max(\u03c4_AB||\u03c1_AB),\n\nwhere \u2131 is some set of free states. If there is no such state \u03c4_AB\u2208 that satisfies \u03c4_AB\u2264 2^\u03bb\u03c1_AB for any \u03bb\u2208\u211d, _max,\u2131(\u03c1_AB) is set to be 0. \n\nThis measure bears many nice properties. First, it can be efficiently computed via semidefinite programming (SDP) in many cases which will be discussed in the latter sections. Second, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) gives the closest free state \u03c4_AB\u2208 to \u03c1_AB, w.r.t. the max-relative entropy. Third, _max,\u2131(\u00b7) is subadditive w.r.t the tensor product of states. In fact, _max,\u2131(\u03c1_AB) is closely related to the weight of resource W(\u03c1_AB)\u00a0<cit.> and the free component \u0393(\u03c1_AB)\u00a0<cit.>, both of which have fruitful properties and applications\u00a0<cit.>, as follows\n\n    2^-_max,\u2131(\u03c1_AB)  = 1-W(\u03c1_AB) = \u0393(\u03c1_AB).\n\nWe note that each part of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) quantifies the largest weight where a free state can take in a convex decomposition of \u03c1_AB. When moving on to operational tasks that the free state can be ignored, what is left in a convex decomposition becomes our main concern. Optimization of the weight in the decomposition can be visualized as squeezing out all free parts of the given state. Thus, we further introduce the -squeezed state of \u03c1_AB as follows.\n\nFor a bipartite quantum state \u03c1_AB and a free state set , \n\n\n\n\n\nIf _max,\u2131(\u03c1_AB) is non-zero, the -squeezed state of \u03c1_AB is defined by\n\n    \u03c9_AB = \u03c1_AB-2^-_max,\u2131(\u03c1_AB)\u00b7\u03c4_AB/1-2^-_max,\u2131(\u03c1_AB),\n\nwhere \u03c4_AB is the closest free state to \u03c1_AB in terms of the max-relative entropy, i.e., the optimal solution in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). If _max,\u2131(\u03c1_AB)=0, the -squeezed state of \u03c1_AB is itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sections, we will illustrate the applications of the reverse max-relative entropy of resources as well as the squeezing idea on example tasks. One is giving upper bounds on the distillable entanglement of arbitrary quantum states. The other is to derive upper bounds on the quantum capacity of channels. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 APPLICATIONS ON DISTILLABLE ENTANGLEMENT\n \nIn this section, we investigate the information-theoretic application of the reverse max-relative entropy of resources in deriving efficiently computable upper bounds on the distillable entanglement. To showcase the advantage of our bounds, we compare the results with different continuity bounds and the Rains bound on the maximally entangled states with practical noises.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Upper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement\n\nRecall that the one-way distillable entanglement has a regularized formula\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n    E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) = lim_n\u2192\u221e1/nE^(1)_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB^\u2297 n),\n\nwhere \nE^(1)_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) := max_T I_(A'\u27e9 M B)_T(\u03c1_AB),\nand the maximization ranges over all quantum instruments\nT:A\u2192 A'M on Alice\u2019s system. The regularization in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) for E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) is intractable to compute in most cases. However, there are some categories of states whose E_D,\u2192 can be reduced to single-letter formulae. Two important classes are called degradable states and anti-degradable states.\n\nLet \u03c1_AB be a bipartite state with purification |\u03d5\u27e9_ABE. \u03c1_AB is called degradable if there exists a CPTP map \u2133_B\u2192 E such that \u2133_B\u2192 E(\u03c1_AB) = _B(\u03d5_ABE), and is called anti-degradable if there exists a CPTP map \u2133_E\u2192 B such that \u2133_E\u2192 B(\u03c1_AE) = _E(\u03d5_ABE). Equivalently, a state is anti-degradable if and only if it has a symmetric extension\u00a0<cit.>, thus is also called a two-extendible state. For the degradable states, it is shown that\u00a0<cit.>\n\n    E^(1)_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB^\u2297 n) = n  E^(1)_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) = n I_(A\u27e9 B)_\u03c1, \u2200 n\u2208\u2115,\n\nresulting in E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) =  I_(A\u27e9 B)_\u03c1. For the anti-degradable states, consisting of a compact and convex set, it always holds\n\n    E^(1)_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) = E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) = 0.\n\nMoreover, E_D,\u2192(\u00b7) is convex on decomposing a state into degradable and anti-degradable parts\u00a0<cit.>. To better exploit this convexity, we introduce the reverse max-relative entropy of unextendible entanglement to help identify the anti-degradable (two-extendible) part of a given bipartite state \u03c1_AB:\n\n    _max,(\u03c1_AB) := min_\u03c4\u2208D_max(\u03c4_AB||\u03c1_AB),\n\nwhere  is the set of all anti-degradable states. In this resource theory, the resource we consider is the extendible entanglement, and the free states are bipartite states that are possibly shareable between A and a third party E, where E is isomorphic to B. Notably, the extendibility of entanglement is a key property in entanglement theory with many existing applications\u00a0<cit.>. Here, combined with the idea of entanglement of formation, _max,(\u03c1_AB) can be applied to derive an upper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement of an arbitrary state \u03c1_AB as shown in Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\n\nFor any bipartite state \u03c1_AB, it satisfies\n\n    E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) \u2264 E_ rev^u(\u03c1_AB):=[1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)]\u00b7 E_F(\u03c9_AB),\n\nwhere \u03c9_AB is the -squeezed state of \u03c1_AB, _max,(\u00b7) is the reverse max-relative entropy of unextendible entanglement, and E_F(\u00b7) is the entanglement of formation.\n\n\nSuppose the ADG-squeezed state of \u03c1_AB is \u03c9_AB and the optimal solution in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) for \u03c1_AB is \u03c4_AB. It follows \n\n    \u03c1_AB = [1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)]\u03c9_AB + 2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)\u03c4_AB,\n\nwhere \u03c4_AB is anti-degradable. Suppose \u03c9_AB admit a pure state decomposition \u03c9_AB= \u2211_ip_i |\u03c9_i\u27e9\u27e8\u03c9_i|_AB. Since any pure state is degradable, we now can decompose \u03c1_AB into degradable parts and anti-degradable parts as\n\n    \u03c1_AB = [1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)]\u2211_i p_i |\u03c9_i\u27e9\u27e8\u03c9_i|_AB + 2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)\u03c4_AB,\n\nAccording to the essential convexity of E_D,\u2192(\u00b7) on decomposing a state into degradable and anti-degradable parts proved by Leditzky et al.\u00a0<cit.>, we have\n\n    E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB)    \u2264 [1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)]\u00b7\u2211_i p_i E_D,\u2192(\u03c9_i) + 2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB) E_D,\u2192(\u03c4_AB)\n       \u2264 [1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)]\u00b7\u2211_i p_i I_c(A\u27e9 B)_\u03c9_i,\n\nwhere the second inequality is due to the fact in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) of degradable states and anti-degradable states, respectively. After taking the minimization over all possible decomposition of \u03c9_AB, we arrived at\n\n    E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB)    \u2264 [1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)]\u00b7min\u2211_i p_i I_c(A\u27e9 B)_\u03c9_i\n       =[1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)]\u00b7 E_F(\u03c9_AB).\n\n\n\nThe bound E_ rev^u(\u03c1_AB) has a cartoon illustration as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. The main insight of it is to squeeze out as much of the free or useless part, the anti-degradable state here, as possible. We point out that squeezing all useless parts out does not necessarily give the tightest upper bound in terms of the one-way distillable entanglement, e.g., isotropic state\u00a0<cit.>. Instead of squeezing out all the useless parts, there may be room for exploring more appropriate partitions when we try to decompose a specific quantum state. However, the approach we present in Theorem\u00a0<ref> is an invaluable method for general states as shown in subsection\u00a0<ref> and can be seen as a variant of the continuity bound in terms of the anti-degradability of the state.\n\n\nFor any bipartite state \u03c1_AB, it satisfies\n\n    E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) \u2264E_ rev^u(\u03c1_AB) := [1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)]\u00b7\u2211_i\u03bb_i S(B)_\u03c8_i,\n\nwhere \u03c9_AB=\u2211_i\u03bb_i |\u03c8_i\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8_i| is the spectral decomposition of the ADG-squeezed state \u03c9_AB of \u03c1_AB.\n\nCorollary <ref> is followed by the fact that E_F(\u03c9_AB) has a trivial upper bound as E_F(\u03c9_AB) \u2264\u2211_i\u03bb_i S(B)_\u03c8_i. We note that any other good upper bound on the entanglement of formation can also be applied to Theorem\u00a0<ref>. In particular, the bound E_ rev^u(\u03c1_AB) is efficiently computable since _max,(\u03c1_AB) and 2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB) can be efficiently computed via an SDP. By Slater\u2019s condition\u00a0<cit.>, the following two optimization programs satisfy the strong duality, and both evaluate to 1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB). We denote P_BE as a permutation operator on the system B and E and remain the derivation of the dual program in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\n\n    Primal Program\n    min_\u03c9_AB, \u03c4_AB, \u03c4_ABE    [\u03c9_AB],\n     s.t.    \u03c1_AB =\u03c9_AB+\u03c4_AB, \n        \u03c9_AB\u2265 0, \u03c4_AB\u2265 0, \u03c4_ABE\u2265 0,\n        _E[\u03c4_ABE] = _B[\u03c4_ABE] = \u03c4_AB,\n       Dual Program\n    max_M_AB,N_AB,K_AE    [M_AB\u03c1_AB],\n     s.t.

Remarkably, such decomposition is challenging to construct since the degradable state set is not necessarily convex. Thus it is difficult to compute E_ DA(\u00b7) in\u00a0<cit.>  in practice due to the hardness of tracking all possible decompositions. Whereas, E_ rev^u(\u03c1_AB) overcomes this difficulty and is efficiently computable. It outperforms the known upper bounds for many maximally entangled states under practical noises in a high-noise region, as shown in subsection <ref>. Furthermore, our method is flexible in selecting other decomposition strategies, i.e., the object functions in the SDP, other than trivially calculating the ratio at the sub-state decomposition.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Continuity bounds of the one-way distillable entanglement\n\nNote that the insight of the bound above is considering the distance of a given state between the anti-degradable states set. With different distance measures, the authors in\u00a0<cit.> derived continuity bounds on quantum capacity in terms of the (anti)degradability of the channel. Thus for self-contained, we introduce some distance measures between a state and the set  and prove the continuity bounds for the state version as a comparison with E_ rev^u(\u03c1_AB).\n\n\nLet \u03c1_AB be a bipartite quantum state, the anti-degradable set distance is defined by\n\n    d_ set(\u03c1_AB) := min_\u03c3_AB\u2208 ADG1/2\u03c1_AB - \u03c3_AB_1,\n\nwhere the minimization ranges over all anti-degradable states on system AB. \n\nAnalogous to the anti-degradable set distance, one also has the anti-degradable map distance as follows.\n\nLet \u03c1_AB be a bipartite quantum state with purification \u03d5_ABE, the anti-degradable map distance is defined by\n\n    d_ map(\u03c1_AB):= min_\ud835\udc9f:E\u2192 B1/2\u03c1_AB - \ud835\udc9f(\u03c1_AE)_1\n    ,\n\nwhere \u03c1_AE = _B(\u03d5_ABE) and the minimization ranges over all CPTP maps \ud835\udc9f.\n\n\nBoth parameters can be computed via SDP, ranging from [0,1], and are equal to 0 iff \u03c1_AB is anti-degradable. Similar to the idea in\u00a0<cit.> for channels and the proof techniques in\u00a0<cit.>, we utilize the continuity bound of the conditional entropy in Lemma <ref> proved by Winter\u00a0<cit.> to derive two continuity upper bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement, concerning the distance measures above. The proofs can be found in Appendix <ref>. We denote h(p)=-plog p - (1-p)log(1-p) as the binary entropy and g(p):= (1+p)h(p/1+p) as the bosonic entropy. \n\n\nFor any bipartite state \u03c1_AB with an anti-degradable set distance \u03b5_ set, it satisfies\n\n    E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) \u2264 E_ SCB(\u03c1_AB) := 2\u03b5_ setlog(|A|) + g(\u03b5_ set).\n\n\n\nFor any bipartite state \u03c1_AB with an anti-degradable map distance \u03b5_ map, it satisfies\n\n    E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_AB) \u2264 E_ MCB(\u03c1_AB) := 4\u03b5_ maplog(|B|) + 2g(\u03b5_ map).\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Examples of less-entangled states\n\nWe now compare the performance of different continuity bounds and the Rains bound with E_ rev^u(\u00b7) by some concrete examples. Due to noise and other device imperfections, one usually obtains some less entangled states in practice rather than the maximally entangled ones. Such a disturbance can be characterized by some CPTP maps appearing in each party. Thus for the task of the distillation of the maximally entangled states under practical noises, we consider Alice and Bob are sharing pairs of maximally entangled states affected by bi-local noisy channels, i.e.,\n\n    \u03c1_A'B' = _A\u2192 A'\u2297_B\u2192 B'(\u03a6_AB).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nQubit system Suppose Alice's qubit is affected by the qubit amplitude damping channel with Kraus operators\nK_0 = |0\u27e9\u27e80| + \u221a(1-\u03b3)|1\u27e9\u27e81|, K_1 = \u221a(\u03b3)|0\u27e9\u27e81|, and Bob's qubit is affected by the depolarizing channel (\u03c1) = (1-p)\u03c1 + p I_2/2. Set \u03b3 = 0.1 and the noise parameter of depolarizing noise varies in the range p\u2208[0.15,0.3]. E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_A'B') has upper bounds as functions of p shown in Fig. <ref> (a).\n\n\n\n  \nQutrit system For the system with a dimension d>2, we consider the multilevel versions of the amplitude damping channel (MAD)\u00a0<cit.> as a local noise for Alice. The Kraus operators of a MAD channel in a d-dimensional system are defined by\n\n    K\u0302_i j   \u2261\u221a(\u03b3_j i)|i\u27e9\u27e8j|,   \u2200 i, j  s.t.  0 \u2264 i \u2264 d-1, \n    K\u0302_0    \u2261|0\u27e9\u27e80|+ \u2211_1 \u2264 j \u2264 d-1\u221a(1-\u03be_j)|j\u27e9\u27e8j|,\n\nwith \u03b3_j i real quantities describing the decay rate from the j-th to the i-th level that fulfill the conditions\n\n    0 \u2264\u03b3_j i\u2264 1,    \u2200 i, j  s.t.  0 \u2264 i<j \u2264 d-1, \n    \u03be_j \u2261\u2211_0 \u2264 i<j\u03b3_j i\u2264 1,    \u2200 j=1, \u22ef, d-1.\n\nSuppose Alice qutrit is affected by a MAD channel with \u03b3_10 = \u03b3_20 = 0.1,  \u03b3_21 = 0. Bob's qutrit is affected by a qutrit depolarizing channel with the noise parameter p. Then E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_A'B') has upper bounds as functions of p shown in Fig. <ref> (b).\n\n\n\n  \nQudit system For the qudit system, we consider Alice's qudit is affected by a MAD channel with d=4 defined in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), where \u03b3_10 = \u03b3_20 = \u03b3_30 = \u03b3_21 = 0.1, \u03b3_31 = \u03b3_32 = 0.\nLet Bob's qudit be affected by a qudit depolarizing channel with noise parameter p, then E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_A'B') has upper bounds as functions of p shown in Fig. <ref> (c).\n\n\n\n  \nNoisy Bell state Specifically for a Bell state destroyed by bi-local depolarizing noises, i.e., \u03c1_A'B'=_A\u2192 A'\u2297_B\u2192 B' (\u03a6_AB), we give an analytical upper bound on E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_A'B') as shown in Proposition <ref>. \n\nLet \u03a6_AB be a Bell state and _A\u2192 A', _B\u2192 B' be depolarizing channels on system A and B, respectively. The state \u03c1_A'B'=_A\u2192 A'\u2297_B\u2192 B' (\u03a6_AB) either is anti-degradable with E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_A'B')=0 or satisfies\n\n    2^-_max,(\u03c1_A'B') =3(p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B)\n\nand \n\n    E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_A'B') \u2264 1 - 3(p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B),\n\nwhere p_A, p_B are noise parameters of _A\u2192 A' and _B\u2192 B', respectively.\n\n\nIn the beginning, we note that if 1 - 3(p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B)\u2264 0, the state \u03c1_A'B' is anti-degradable according to Lemma\u00a0<ref>, which gives E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_A'B')=0. Then if 1 - 3(p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B)>0,\nwe will first prove 2^-_max,(\u03c1_A'B')\u2265 3(p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B) use the primal SDP in (<ref>). We show that {\u03c9\u0302_A'B',\u03c4\u0302_A'B'E} is a feasible solution to the primal SDP, where\n\n    \u03c9\u0302_A'B' = 1-3(p_A+p_B-p_Ap_B)/2(|00\u27e9\u27e800| + |11\u27e9\u27e811|+ |00\u27e9\u27e811| + |11\u27e9\u27e800|),\n\n\n    \u03c4\u0302_A'B'E = (\n        [ 4\u03b6  0  0  0  0 2\u03b6 2\u03b6  0;  0  \u03b6  \u03b6  0  0  0  0 2\u03b6;  0  \u03b6  \u03b6  0  0  0  0 2\u03b6;  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0;  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0; 2\u03b6  0  0  0  0  \u03b6  \u03b6  0; 2\u03b6  0  0  0  0  \u03b6  \u03b6  0;  0 2\u03b6 2\u03b6  0  0  0  0 4\u03b6;    ]),\n\nwith \u03b6 = p_A + p_B - p_A p_B/4. When the Bell state shared by Alice and Bob is affected by bi-local depolarizing channels _A\u2192 A' and _B\u2192 B' with noise parameters p_A and p_B, respectively, the resulting state is\n\n    \u03c1_A'B' =   _A\u2192 A'\u2297_B\u2192 B' (\u03a6_AB)\n    \n        =    2-(p_A+p_B)+p_Ap_B/4(|00\u27e9\u27e800| + |11\u27e9\u27e811|)+ p_A+p_B-p_Ap_B/4(|01\u27e9\u27e801| + |10\u27e9\u27e810|)\n        + 1-(p_A+p_B)+p_Ap_B/2(|00\u27e9\u27e811|+|11\u27e9\u27e800|).\n\nThen the unnormalized state \u03c4\u0302_A'B' = \u03c1_A'B' - \u03c9\u0302_A'B' is\n\n    \u03c4\u0302_A'B' =   5(p_A+p_B-p_Ap_B)/4(|00\u27e9\u27e800| + |11\u27e9\u27e811|)+ p_A+p_B-p_Ap_B/4(|01\u27e9\u27e801| + |10\u27e9\u27e810|)\n       + (p_A+p_B-p_Ap_B)(|00\u27e9\u27e811|+|11\u27e9\u27e800|).\n\nIt is straightforward to check that \u03c4\u0302_A'B'E\u2265 0 and _E[\u03c4\u0302_A'B'E] = _B[\u03c4\u0302_A'B'E] = \u03c4\u0302_A'B'.  Thus, we have proven that {\u03c9\u0302_A'B',\u03c4\u0302_A'B'E} is a feasible solution to the primal SDP, implying that\n\n    1 - 2^-_max,(\u03c1_A'B')\u2264[\u03c9\u0302_A'B'] = 1 - 3(p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B)\n\nand 2^-_max,(\u03c1_A'B')\u2265 3(p_A + p_B - p_A p_B).\n\nSecond, we will use the dual SDP in (<ref>) to prove 2^-_max,(\u03c1_A'B')\u2264 3(p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B). We show that { M_AB, N_AB, K_AB} is a feasible solution to the dual problem, where\n\n    M_AB = (\n        [ -1  0  0  2;  0 -3  0  0;  0  0 -3  0;  2  0  0 -1;    ]),\n        N_AB = K_AB = -1/2M_AB.\n\nTo check the constraints, we have M_AB\u2264 I_AB, M_AB + N_AB + K_AB = 0 and N_AB\u2297 I_E + P_BE(K_AB\u2297 I_E)P_BE^\u2020\u2265 0. By direct calculation, we have [M_AB\u03c1_A'B'] = 1 - 3(p_A + p_B-p_A p_B). Thus, we have proven {M_AB, N_AB, K_AB} is a feasible solution, which implies that\n\n    1 - 2^-_max,(\u03c1_A'B')\u2265[M_AB\u03c1_A'B'] = 1 - 3(p_A + p_B-p_A p_B),\n\nand 2^-_max,(\u03c1_A'B')\u2264 3(p_A + p_B - p_A p_B). Combining the dual part with the primal part, we arrive at\n\n    2^-_max,(\u03c1_A'B') = 3(p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B)\n\nSince the normalized state \u03c9_A'B' of \u03c9\u0302_A'B' is a maximally entangled state with E_D,\u2192(\u03c9_A'B')=1, we have E_D,\u2192(\u03c1_A'B') \u2264 1 - 3(p_A + p_B-p_A p_B).\n\n\nAs shown in Fig <ref>, we plot \nfour different upper bounds and the Hashing bound in different dimensional systems in a high-noise region. We can see that E_ rev^u(\u03c1_AB) is lower than the other two continuity bounds and the Rains bound in the orange dotted line, acting the tightest among all upper bounds. We demonstrate the advantage of our analytic bound in Proposition\u00a0<ref> by comparing it with the continuity bounds and the Rains bound in Fig. <ref> (d), where the depolarizing noise parameter p_B is set to 0.1 and the noise parameter p_A is varied.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Extending the method to the two-way distillable entanglement\n\nSimilar to the reverse max-relative entropy of unextendible entanglement, for a given bipartite state \u03c1_AB, we introduce the reverse max-relative entropy of NPT entanglement as\n\n    _max,(\u03c1_AB) := min_\u03c4\u2208D_max(\u03c4_AB||\u03c1_AB),\n\nwhere the minimization ranges over all  states. Based on the convexity of E_D,\u2194(\u00b7) on decomposing a state into the maximally correlated (MC) states and the PPT states\u00a0<cit.> (see Appendix <ref> for more details), the reverse max-relative entropy of NPT entanglement can be applied to derive an upper bound on the two-way distillable entanglement as Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\n\nFor any bipartite state \u03c1_AB, it satisfies\n\n    E_D,\u2194(\u03c1_AB) \u2264 E_ rev^npt(\u03c1_AB):=[1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)]\u00b7 E_F(\u03c9_AB),\n\nwhere \u03c9_AB is the PPT-squeezed state of \u03c1_AB and _max,(\u00b7) is the reverse max-relative entropy of NPT entanglement.\n\nIt also follows an efficiently computable relaxation as E_ rev^npt(\u03c1_AB)= [1-2^-_max,(\u03c1_AB)] \u2211_i\u03bb_i S(B)_\u03c8_i, where \u03c9_AB=\u2211_i\u03bb_i |\u03c8_i\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8_i| is the spectral decomposition of the PPT-squeezed state \u03c9_AB of \u03c1_AB. \n\nIn fact, E_ rev^npt(\u00b7) can be interpreted as an easily computable version of the bound E_ MP(\u00b7) in\u00a0<cit.>, utilizing the convexity of E_D,\u2194(\u03c1_AB) on the convex decomposition of \u03c1_AB into MC states and PPT states. Since the set of all MC states is not convex, tracking all possible decompositions to compute E_ MP(\u00b7) is generally hard. However, E_ rev^npt(\u00b7) is efficiently computable by SDP and tightens the upper bound of the example states illustrated in\u00a0<cit.>, whose details can be found in Appendix <ref>. We note that R(\u03c1_AB) \u2264 E_ MP(\u03c1_AB)\u2264E_ rev^npt(\u03c1_AB) where R(\u00b7) is the Rains bound for the two-way distillable entanglement. Nevertheless, E_ rev^npt(\u00b7) connects the reverse max-relative entropy of NPT entanglement with the entanglement of formation, and we believe such connection would shed light on the study of other quantum resource theories as well. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 APPLICATIONS ON QUANTUM CHANNEL CAPACITY\n\n\nFor a general quantum channel _A\u2192 B, its quantum capacity has a regularized formula proved by Lloyd, Shor, and Devetak\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n    Q() = lim_n\u2192\u221e1/nQ^(1)(^ n),\n\nwhere Q^(1)():= max_|\u03d5\u27e9_A'A I_c(A'\u27e9 B)_()(\u03d5) is the channel coherent information. Similar to the one-way distillable entanglement of a state, the regularization in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) makes the quantum capacity of a channel intractable to compute generally. Substantial efforts have been made to establish upper bounds. One routine is inspired by the Rains bound in entanglement theory\u00a0<cit.>. Tomamichel et al. introduced Rains information\u00a0<cit.> for a quantum channel as an upper bound on the quantum capacity. Then some efficiently computable relaxations or estimations are given in\u00a0<cit.>. Another routine is to consider the (anti)degradability of the quantum channels and to construct flag extensions, which gives the currently tightest upper bound for quantum channels with symmetry or known structures\u00a0<cit.>. \n\nA channel _A\u2192 B is called degradable if there exits a CPTP map _B\u2192 E such that ^c = \u2218, and is called anti-degradable if there exits a CPTP map _E\u2192 B such that = \u2218^c. It is known that  is (anti)degradable if and only if its Choi state J_ is (anti)degradable. The quantum capacity of an anti-degradable channel is zero and the coherent information of a degradable channel is additive which leads to Q() = Q^(1)(). Also, the quantum capacity admits convexity on decomposing a channel into a convex combination of degradable channels and anti-degradable channels\u00a0<cit.> which can give a simple upper bound on Q(). Concerning the (anti)degradability of a channel, the authors in <cit.> called a channel \u03b5-degradable channel if there is a CPTP map _B\u2192 E such that || ^c - \u2218||_\u2662\u2264 2\u03b5. A channel is called \u03b5-anti-degradable channel if there is a CPTP map _E\u2192 B such that ||  - \u2218^c||_\u2662\u2264 2\u03b5. Based on these, one has continuity bounds of the quantum capacity as follows.\n\n    Given a quantum channel _A \u2192 B, if it is -degradable, then it satisfies Q() \u2264 Q^(1)() + log(d_E - 1) + h() + 2log d_E + g(). If _A\u2192 B is -anti-degradable, it satisfies Q() \u2264log(|B|-1) + 2log|B| + h() + g().\n\n\nWith a similar spirit of the reverse max-relative entropy of unextendible entanglement in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), for a quantum channel _A\u2192 B, we define the reverse max-relative entropy of anti-degradability of the channel as\n\n    _max,(_A\u2192 B) := min_'_A\u2192 B\u2208_D_max('_A\u2192 B||_A\u2192 B),\n\nwhere _ is the set of all anti-degradable channels and the max-relative entropy of '_A\u2192 B with respect to _A\u2192 B is defined by\n\n    D_max('_A\u2192 B||_A\u2192 B):=  inf{\u03bb\u2208\u211d: J_AB^'\u2264 2^\u03bb J_AB^}.\n\nIf there is no such a channel '_A\u2192 B\u2208_ that satisfies J_AB^'\u2264 2^\u03bb J_AB^, _max,(_A\u2192 B) is set to be 0. Similar to the state case, _max,(_A\u2192 B) has a geometric implication analogous to the distance between _A\u2192 B to the set of all anti-degradable channels. We can introduce the -squeezed channel of _A\u2192 B as follows.\n\nFor a quantum channel _A\u2192 B and the anti-degradable channel set _, if _max,() is non-zero, the -squeezed channel of _A\u2192 B is defined by\n\n    _A\u2192 B = _A\u2192 B - 2^-_max,()\u00b7^'_A\u2192 B/1-2^-_max,()\n\nwhere ^'_A\u2192 B is the closest anti-degradable channel to _A\u2192 B in terms of the max-relative entropy, i.e., the optimal solution in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). If _max,() is zero, the -squeezed channel of _A\u2192 B is itself.\n \nNotably, _max,(), or 2^-_max,() equivalently, can be efficiently computed via SDP. The following two optimization programs satisfy the strong duality, and both evaluate to 1-2^-_max,().

The insight here is that one can ignore the contribution from the anti-degradable part for the quantum capacity, and the quantum capacity admits convexity on the decomposition into degradable and anti-degradable parts. In this way, the following Theorem\u00a0<ref> gives an upper bound Q_ sqz() for the quantum capacity of .\n\nGiven a quantum channel _A \u2192 B, if it has an ADG-squeezed channel _A\u2192 B, we denote\n_A\u2192 BB' as an extended channel of _A\u2192 B such that _B'[_A\u2192 BB'(\u03c1_A)] = _A\u2192 B(\u03c1_A), \u2200\u03c1_A\u2208(_A). Then it satisfies\n\n    Q() \u2264 Q_ sqz() := [1-2^-_max,()]\u00b7min{ Q^(1)() |  _A\u2192 BB'},\n\nwhere the minimization is over all possible extended channels of S_A\u2192 B. If there is no such a degradable _A\u2192 BB' exists, the value of this bound is set to be infinity.\n\n\nBy the definition of the -squeezed channel of _A\u2192 B, we have\n\n    _A\u2192 B = [1-2^-_max,()] \u00b7_A\u2192 B + 2^-_max,()\u00b7'_A\u2192 B\n\nwhere '_A\u2192 B is anti-degradable. We write an extended channel of '_A\u2192 B as '_A\u2192 BB'(\u03c1_A) = _A\u2192 B(\u03c1_A) |0\u27e9\u27e80|_B', which is obviously anti-degradable. Then we can construct a quantum channel _A\u2192 BB' as\n\n    _A\u2192 BB' = [1-2^-_max,()] \u00b7_A\u2192 BB' + 2^-_max,()\u00b7'_A\u2192 BB',\n\nsuch that _B'[_A\u2192 BB'(\u03c1_A)] = _A\u2192 B(\u03c1_A) for any state \u03c1_A and _A\u2192 BB' is degradable. This means after discarding the partial environment B', the receiver can obtain the original quantum information sent through _A\u2192 B. In this case,  can certainly convey more quantum information than the , i.e., Q()\u2264 Q(). Note that the quantum capacity admits convexity on the decomposition into degradable parts and anti-degradable parts\u00a0<cit.>. We conclude that\n\n    Q()\u2264 Q()    \u2264 [1-2^-_max,()] \u00b7 Q() + 2^-_max,()\u00b7 Q(')\n        = [1-2^-_max,()] \u00b7 Q^(1)(),\n\nwhere the equality is followed by the quantum capacity is additive on degradable channels and is zero for anti-degradable channels. Considering the freedom of the choice of _A\u2192 BB', we obtain\n\n    Q_ sqz() := [1-2^-_max,()] \u00b7min{ Q^(1)() | _A\u2192 BB'}\n\nas an upper bound on Q().\n\n\nTheorem\u00a0<ref> can be seen as a channel version of Theorem\u00a0<ref>. However, in order to utilize the convexity of the quantum capacity after the squeezing process, it is challenging to decompose the ADG-squeezed channel into the sum of degradable ones. An alternative approach here is to use the idea of the extension channel. For the qubit channels specifically, this bound is efficiently computable and effective, as shown in subsection\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Quantum capacity of qubit channels\n\nFor a quantum channel with dimension two in both input and output systems, we prove that the ADG-squeezed channel is always degradable. Thus, we give an efficiently computable upper bound on the quantum capacity using the idea of the reverse max-relative entropy of anti-degradability.\n\n    For any qubit channel _A\u2192 B, it is either anti-degradable or satisfies\n    \n    Q() \u2264 [1-2^-_max,()] \u00b7max_p \u2208[0,1] I_c(p|0\u27e9\u27e80|+(1-p)|1\u27e9\u27e81|, _A\u2192 B),\n\n    where I_c(\u03c1, \ud835\udca9) \u2261 H(\ud835\udca9(\u03c1))-H(\ud835\udca9^c(\u03c1)) and _A\u2192 B is the ADG-squeezed channel of _A\u2192 B.\n\n\nBy the definition of the -squeezed channel of _A\u2192 B, we have\n\n    _A\u2192 B = [1-2^-_max,()] \u00b7_A\u2192 B + 2^-_max,()\u00b7'_A\u2192 B\n\nwhere '_A\u2192 B is anti-degradable and _A\u2192 B is not anti-degradable. If _A\u2192 B is also not degradable, we can further decompose _A\u2192 B into = c _0 +(1-c)S_1 such that _0 is degradable and _1 is anti-degradable since the extreme points of the set of all qubit channels have been shown to be degradable or anti-degradable channels\u00a0<cit.>. This conflicts with the definition of 2^-_max,(), which implies _A\u2192 B is degradable. Thus,\n\n    Q()    \u2264 [1-2^-_max,()] \u00b7 Q() + 2^-_max,()\u00b7 Q(')\n       = [1-2^-_max,()] \u00b7 Q^(1)()\n       =[1-2^-_max,()] \u00b7max_p \u2208[0,1] I_c(p|0\u27e9\u27e80|+(1-p)|1\u27e9\u27e81|, _A\u2192 B).\n\nNote that the last equality is because _A\u2192 B is degradable, and diagonal input states outperform non-diagonal states during the optimization of the channel coherent information\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nMixed unitary channels \nTo compare the performance of our method with some best-known computable bounds, e.g., the continuity bound in Theorem\u00a0<ref> and the bound R\u0302_\u03b1\u00a0<cit.> generalized from the max-Rain information\u00a0<cit.>, we consider the mixed unitary channel _A\u2192 B(\u00b7) as follows:\n\n    (\u03c1) = \u2211_i=0^k p_i U_i \u03c1 U_i^\u2020,\n\nwhere \u2211_i=0^k p_i= 1 and U_i are unitary operators on a qubit system. In specific, we choose some fixed set of parameters and sample 1000 channels with randomly generated unitaries according to the Haar measure. We compute the distance between Q_ sqz and other bounds, then have statistics on the distribution of these channels according to the distance value. The distribution results are depicted in Fig.\u00a0<ref> where the purple region corresponds to the cases Q_ sqz is tighter, and the pink region corresponds to the cases Q_ sqz is looser. We can see that in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a) and Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c), Q_ sqz always outperforms the continuity bound of anti-degradability and in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b) and Fig.\u00a0<ref>(d), our bound is tighter than R\u0302_\u03b1(10) for many cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nPauli channels A representative qubit channel is the Pauli channel describing bit-flip errors and phase-flip errors with certain probabilities in qubits. A qubit Pauli channel \u039b(\u00b7) is defined as:\n\n    \u039b(\u03c1) = p_0 \u03c1 + p_1 X\u03c1 X + p_2 Y\u03c1 Y +p_3 Z\u03c1 Z,\n\nwhere X,Y,Z are the Pauli operators and \u2211_i=0^3 p_i = 1 are probability parameters. Note that for the quantum capacity, we only need to consider the cases where p_0 dominates. Since if, for example, bit flip error X happens with probability larger than p_0, one can first apply a X flip, mapping that channel back into the case where p_0>p_1. After utilizing our method on Pauli channels, the ADG-squeezed parameter is characterized in Proposition\u00a0<ref>,  whose proof can be found in Appendix\u00a0<ref>. Thus, combined with Proposition\u00a0<ref>, we can recover the no-cloning bound\u00a0<cit.> on the quantum capacity of qubit Pauli channels.\n\nFor a qubit Pauli channel \u039b(\u00b7) with p_0\u2265 p_i>0 (i=1,2,3), it is either anti-degradable or satisfies\n\n    2^-_max,(\u039b) = (\u221a(p_1)+\u221a(p_2))^2 + (\u221a(p_2)+\u221a(p_3))^2+(\u221a(p_1)+\u221a(p_3))^2\n\nwith an ADG-squeezed channel as the identity channel.\n\n\n\nFor a qubit Pauli channel \u039b(\u00b7), its quantum capacity is either vanishing or satisfies \n\n    Q(\u039b) \u2264 \n            1-(\u221a(p_1)+\u221a(p_2))^2 -(\u221a(p_2)+\u221a(p_3))^2-(\u221a(p_1)+\u221a(p_3))^2\n\n\n\nOne recent work <cit.> studies the capacities of a subclass of Pauli channels called the covariant Pauli channel, where the parameters are set p_1 = p_2 with p_0+2p_1+p_3=1, i.e., \u039b_ cov(\u03c1) = p_0 \u03c1 + p_1 (X\u03c1 X + Y\u03c1 Y)+ p_3 Z\u03c1 Z. Applying Theorem\u00a0<ref> on the covariant Pauli channels, we can bound their quantum capacity as follows.\n\nFor a covariant Pauli channel \u039b_ cov(\u00b7), it is either anti-degradable with a zero quantum capacity or satisfies Q(\u039b_ cov)\u2264 Q_ sqz(\u039b_ cov), where \n\n    Q_ sqz (\u039b_ cov) = \n             3p_0 + p_3 -\u221a(8(p_3-p_0p_3-p_3^2))-2.\n\n\nIn Fig.\u00a0<ref>, we compare our bound with the upper bounds given in\u00a0<cit.> and the continuity bound of anti-degradability in Theorem\u00a0<ref>. It can be seen that our bound in the orange line, coinciding with the no-cloning bound, outperforms previous bounds, and thus can better characterize the quantum capacity of \u039b_ cov(\u00b7) when it is close to being anti-degradable.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have introduced a resource measure called reverse divergence of resources for quantum states. Specifically, by choosing target free state sets and max-relative entropy, we have employed the reverse max-relative entropy of entanglement which is also related to the \"weight of resource\" in general resource theory. From a conceptual and technical side, these concepts help us to quantify how much useless entanglement we can squeeze out from a state or a channel, which is meaningful in the distillable entanglement and the quantum capacity, respectively. As these quantities can be efficiently determined by semidefinite programming, they are useful in deriving efficiently computable upper bounds on the distillable entanglement and the quantum capacity. \n\n\nTo better explore entanglement distillation, we have derived different continuity bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement in terms of the anti-degradability of the state. In particular, our bound derived from the reverse max-relative entropy of unextendible entanglement outperforms the continuity bounds and the Rains bound in estimating the one-way distillable entanglement for the maximally entangled states under certain noises of interest. We also introduced the reverse max-relative entropy of NPT entanglement and established connections to prior results on the two-way distillable entanglement. Furthermore, we have established an upper bound on the quantum capacity based on the reverse max-relative entropy of anti-degradability of quantum channels.  Our method delivers improved results for random mixed unitary qubit channels, making it an improved benchmark for the quantum capacities of these noisy channels. Also, the analytical bound obtained from our method also recovers the no-cloning bound on Pauli channels\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n\nThese results open a novel way to connect valuable quantum resource measures with quantum communication tasks. \nExcept for the existing applications of the reverse max-relative entropy of resources\u00a0<cit.>, we expect the reverse divergence of resources will find more applications in quantum resource theories in both asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes\u00a0<cit.>. One may further consider choosing other divergences, e.g., the sandwiched R\u00e9nyi relative entropy to solve problems in other tasks possibly. In addition, the reverse divergence of resources may potentially be helpful to the study of other quantum resource theories, including asymmetry\u00a0<cit.>, thermodynamics\u00a0<cit.>, coherence\u00a0<cit.>, nonlocality\u00a0<cit.>, non-stabilizerness\u00a0<cit.>, and non-Gaussianity\u00a0<cit.>. It is also an interesting problem to explore the idea of squeezing useless resources to estimate resource purification rates in quantum resource theories.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.\n \nPart of this work was done when C.

Then, by the following lemma, one can easily arrive at the upper bound in Theorem <ref>.\n\n    The two-way distillable entanglement is convex on convex combinations of MC and PPT states.\n\n\nWe recall the example state given in\u00a0<cit.>. Consider a d dimensional Hilbert space, the generalized Pauli operators X and Z are defined by their action on a computational basis {|k\u27e9}_k=0^d-1 as:\n\n    X|k\u27e9:=|k+1( d)\u27e9   Z|k\u27e9:=\u03c9^k|k\u27e9,\n\nwhere \u03c9:=exp (2 \u03c0 i / d) is a d-th root of unity.
