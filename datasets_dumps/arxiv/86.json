Introduction. \u2014\nSearching for new topological phases and topological phase transitions in various materials or artificial systems\nare fascinating frontiers in modern condensed matter physics <cit.>.\nThe quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) is the simplest topological phase with non-vanishing Chern number <cit.>.\nThe non-interacting fermionic QAH has been experimentally realized in Cr doped Bi(Sb)_2Te_3 thin films\n<cit.>.  On the other hand, the weakly interacting bosonic analogy of QAH model has also been successfully realized\nvia spinor bosons ^87Rb <cit.>.\n\nIt is crucial to study the topological properties of bosonic QAH model,\nand find possible deep connections between the fermionic QAH model and the bosonic QAH model.\n\nIt is well-known that the fermionic QAH model has two bands carrying opposite Chern numbers.\nIn the non-interacting limit,\nwhen |h/t|<4, the corresponding Chern number of the lower and upper band are\nC_1=+ sgn(h) and C_2=- sgn(h), respectively;\nwhen |h/t|>4,  the corresponding Chern number of the lower and upper bands is C_1=C_2=0.\nHowever, the topological properties of weakly interacting bosonic quantum anomalous Hall model\nmaybe much involved. Due to its bosonic nature, an interaction must be considered at the very beginning.\nUnlike the fermionic QAH model,\nthe weakly interacting  bosonic QAH model is always  in some spin-orbital superfluid phases with the spontaneous U(1) symmetry breaking.\nTo the quadratic level, there are always Bogliubov quasi-particle excitations above these exotic superfluid phases.\nIf neglecting the cubic or quartic interactions between them, which is justified near any quantum phase transitions (QPT),\none may ask the question on what are the topology of these Bogliubov quasi-particle bands and possible TPTs.\nIn this Letter, we map out the Chern number of the bosonic Bogliubov band at the quadratic level.\n\n\n\n\nIn Ref.<cit.>, we work out quantum phases and quantum phase transitions in <cit.>.\nIt is the order from quantum disorder (OFQD) phenomena which leads to the quantum ground states at h=0.\nIt is the nearly order from quantum disorder (NOFQD) phenomena which leads to the quantum phase transition at h=h_c.\nIn this work, we focus on the topological aspects of the same system. So the results to be achieved are complementary to those\nachieved in <cit.>.\nWe find that there are two kinds of topological phases and TPTs. The first can be considered as the remnants\nfrom the non-interacting fermion limit, so it reduce to this limit smoothly as the interaction gets very small.\nIt can also be called perturbative regime.\nThe second has no analog or counterpart in the non-interacting fermion limit,\nso it is a completely new feature due to the interaction. We will show that it is completely induced by the\nnon-perturbative OFQD phenomenon at h=0 discovered in <cit.>. It may also be called perturbative regime.\n\nIn addition to the OFQD at h=0 and the QPT at h=h_c induced by the NOFQD discovered in <cit.>,\nwe find two critical fields h_2 > h_1 > h_c >0.\nAt the upper critical field h=h_2,\nthere is a conic band touching at the R= (\u03c0,\u03c0) point of the Brillouin zone (BZ),\nso the lower band C_1 and upper band C_2=-C_1  Chern number changes from (C_1, C_2)=(+1,-1) below h_2\nto  (C_1, C_2)=(0,0) above h_2;\nAt the lower critical field h_1 < h_2,  there is a conic band touching\nat the X=(\u03c0, 0 ) and  Y=(0, \u03c0 ) point of the BZ,\nso (C_1, C_2)=(-1,+1) changes below h_1 to  (C_1, C_2)=(+1,-1) above h_1.\nBoth h_1 and h_2 only depends on t and U, but independent of the SOC t_s,\nand approaches to the corresponding non-interacting value h_20=4t and h_10=0 respectively.\nWe conclude the topology in the regime |h| > |h_1 | belongs to the first perturbative  class.\n\nWe show that h=h_1 > h_c  which is due to the NOFQD <cit.>. When h< h_c, the ground state becomes a XY-CAFM SF phase which breaks\n[ C_4 \u00d7 C_4 ]_D \u2192 1 and leads to  4 bosonic Bogliubov bands in the reduced BZ.\nWe  find there is always a gap between the second and the third band\nand calculate the combined  Chern numbers of the two lower bands and that of the two upper bands  (C_1+2, C_3+4)=(-1,+1).\nSo there is no change on the topological band structure across the QPT at h= h_c.\nHowever, the change comes from h=0 where the OFQD leads to two Dirac points at in-commensurate momenta.\nTheir positions not only depend on t, U, but also the SOC t_s and related by the remaining two Mirror symmetries.\nAs the three parameters change, the two Dirac points approach to each other, then collide at\na degenerate momentum \u039b = (\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2 ), then bounce off along the normal direction.\nAny h \u2260  0 opens the gap on the two Dirac points,\nso there is  a TPT from h < 0 with the combined Chern number  (C_1+2, C_3+4)=(1,-1) to h > 0 with  (C_1+2, C_3+4)=(-1,1),\nwhich is completely induced by the OFQD at h=0.\nWe construct effective action to study the TPT and find it always contains an exotic Doppler shift term.\nThe topology in the regime |h| < |h_1 | belongs to the second non-perturbative  class.\nWe also critically comment on the common conceptual mistakes made in the previous theoretical or experimental literatures\nto attempt to evaluate edge modes within the bulk gaps associated with the bosonic bulk Chern numbers.\nWe also elucidate the physical meanings of the combined Chern numbers.\nFinally, we discuss the experimental detection of these topological phenomena, especially the ones induced by the OFQD near h=0.\n\n\n\n2. The Hamiltonian, quantum phases and quantum phase transitions (QPT). \u2014\nThe recently experimentally realized two-component spinor Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with  a spin-orbit coupling\n<cit.> can be written as\n\n    \u210b =\n    \t-\u2211_i[a_i^\u2020 (t\u03c3_z-it_s\u03c3_x) a_i+x+a_i^\u2020 (t\u03c3_z-it_s\u03c3_y) a_i+y+h.c.]\n    \t\t\n           \n    \t-h\u2211_i(n_i\u2191-n_i\u2193)\n    \t+U\u2211_i n^2_i -\u03bc\u2211_i n_i.\n\nwhere \u03c3=\u2191 or \u2193 denotes the ^87Rb atoms\nin the state |1,m_F=0\u27e9 or |1,m_F=-1\u27e9, respectively.\nSince the experiment can only achieve relatively weak spin-orbit coupling,\nour discussion will focus on regime |t_s|<2|t|.\n\nThe quantum phase diagram of Eq.(<ref>) was studied in Ref.<cit.>.\nEspecially, we found a new phenomenon we named Nearly order from quantum disorder (NOFQD)\nwhich captures the  delicate competition between the effective potential generated by  the order from quantum disorder (OFQD)\nand the Zeeman field. It is this competition which splits a putative first order quantum phase transition (QPT) at h=0 into two second order\nQPTs at h = \u00b1 h_c.\nHere we briefly summarize the main results:\nwhen h > h_c, it is in the Z-FM superfluid\nwith the condensate wavefunction \u03a8\u221d\u03c7_\u2191;\nwhen h < h_c, it is the  XY-CAFM superfluid\nwith the condensate wavefunction\n\u03a8\u221dcos(\u03b8/2)\u03c7_\u2191\n+e^i(\ud835\udc10\u00b7\ud835\udc2b+\u03d5)sin(\u03b8/2)\u03c7_\u2193,\nwhere \ud835\udc10=(\u03c0,\u03c0) is the orbital ordering wave-vector, \u03b8=arccos(h/h_c), and \u03d5=\u00b1\u03c0/4,\u00b13\u03c0/4.\nThe h_c  was estimated as h_c\u223c n_0U^2t_s^2/t^3.\n\n\nHowever, Ref.<cit.> fucus only on the quantum phases and QPTs,\nignored the topological features of the Bogoliubov bands, also did not touch\nwhat are the connections of these quantum phases and QPTs to the topological nature of the QAH Hamiltonian.\nThis work will address these outstanding open problems.\nWithout loss of generality, we can set h,t,t_s>0\nand then discuss the topology of the Bogoliubov excitation bands at h>h_c and h<h_c separately.\n\n\n3. Evaluating the Chern number of the bosonic quasi-particle band from the lattice theory. \u2014\nTo exam the topology of the Bogoliubov excitation bands,\nwe need not only the eigenvalues but also the eigenvectors,\nthus one need also to pay attention to the Bogoliubov transformations. \nAfter replacing the bosonic operator by its average plus a quantum  fluctuation,\nwe obtain a quadratic Bogoliubov Hamiltonian via expanding the Hamiltonian to the second order in the quantum fluctuations.\nDue to the spontaneous U(1) symmetry breaking,\nthe quadratic Hamiltonian in \ud835\udc24-space, H_\ud835\udc24, is a 2N\u00d7 2N matrix,\n\n    \u210b=E_0+1/2\u2211_\ud835\udc24 (\u03c8_\ud835\udc24^\u2020,\u03c8_-\ud835\udc24)\n        H_\ud835\udc24[    \u03c8_\ud835\udc24; \u03c8_-\ud835\udc24^\u2020;        ],\n\nwhere \u03c8_\ud835\udc24^\u2020=(\u03c8_1,\ud835\udc24^\u2020,\u22ef,\u03c8_N,\ud835\udc24^\u2020).\nThe 1,\u22ef,N indices count the spin degrees of freedom\nand also the momentum resulting from the spontaneous translational symmetry breaking i9n the ground state.\nAs shown in <cit.>, when  h>h_c, the ground state is the Z-FM phase,\n\nwe have N=2 and \u03c8_\ud835\udc24^\u2020\n=(\u03c8_\ud835\udc24\u2191^\u2020,\u03c8_\ud835\udc24\u2193^\u2020);\nwhen h<h_c, the ground state is the XY-AFM phase,\n\nwe have N=4 and  \u03c8_\ud835\udc24^\u2020=\n(\u03c8_\ud835\udc24\u2191^\u2020,\u03c8_\ud835\udc24\u2193^\u2020,\n\u03c8_\ud835\udc24+\ud835\udc10\u2191^\u2020,\u03c8_\ud835\udc24+\ud835\udc10\u2193^\u2020). where Q\u20d7= ( \u03c0, \u03c0).\n\nDiagonalizing Eq.(<ref>)  by a 2N\u00d72N Bogoliubov transformation matrix T_\ud835\udc24, so that\nT_\ud835\udc24^\u2020 H_\ud835\udc24 T_\ud835\udc24\n=diag(\u03c9_1,\ud835\udc24,\u22ef,\u03c9_N,\ud835\udc24,\n\u03c9_1,-\ud835\udc24,\u22ef,\u03c9_N,-\ud835\udc24) where diag(\u22ef) means a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements \u22ef,\nand ([    \u03c8_\ud835\udc24; \u03c8_-\ud835\udc24^\u2020;        ])\n    =T_\ud835\udc24\n    ([    \u03b1_\ud835\udc24; \u03b1_-\ud835\udc24^\u2020;        ]), we obtain\n\n    \u210b=E_0+\u2211_n,\ud835\udc24\u03c9_n,\ud835\udc24(\u03b1_n,\ud835\udc24^\u2020\u03b1_n,\ud835\udc24+1/2),\n\nwhere \ud835\udc24 sums over the corresponding Brillouin Zone (BZ),\n\u03c9_n,\u00b1\ud835\udc24 > 0, n=1,\u22ef,N are the N Bogoliubov excitation bands.\n\nIn contrast to the fermionic cases, to keep the bosonic commutation relations,\nthe T_\ud835\udc24 is required to be a para-unitary matrix instead of a unitary one, which means\nT_\ud835\udc24^\u2020\u03c4_3 T_\ud835\udc24\n=T_\ud835\udc24\u03c4_3 T_\ud835\udc24^\u2020=\u03c4_3\nand \u03c4_3=\u03c3_z\u2297 I_N\u00d7 N.\nThe Berry curvature of the n-th Bogoliubov excitation band can be calculated via\nF_n(\ud835\udc24)=i[\u03f5_\u03bc\u03bd\u03c4_3 \u2202_\u03bc T_\ud835\udc24^\u2020\u03c4_3 \u2202_\u03bd T_\ud835\udc24]_nn,\nwhere \u03bc,\u03bd=k_x,k_y.\nThe Chern number of the n-th Bogoliubov excitation band can be evaluated via a integral\n\n    C_n=1/2\u03c0\u222b_BZ d^2 \ud835\udc24 F_n(\ud835\udc24),\n\nwhere the integral is over the corresponding BZ.\n\n4. Evaluating the Chern number of the bosonic quasi-particle band from the continuum theory. \u2014\nSince the band closing is the signature of a topological phase transition (TPT),\nthe change of band Chern number may also be computed in terms of a continuum theory.\n\nNear the band touching point, the typical effective Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the polar coordinate (k,\u03be) with k_x=kcos\u03be and k_y=ksin\u03be,\n\n    H_\ud835\udc24=v_x k^ncos(n\u03be) \u03c3_x+ v_y k^nsin(n\u03be) \u03c3_y- \u0394\u03c3_z\n\nwhere |v_x|=|v_y|=v and n=1,2,3,\u22ef stands for the order  ( or charge ) of the touching point.\n\n\nThe corresponding dispersion relation is\n\u03f5(\ud835\udc24)=\u00b1\u221a(\u0394^2+ v^2 k^2n),\nand \u03f5(\ud835\udc24)\u223c k^n as \u0394\u21920 approaching the TPT.\nThe Berry curvature of the lower branch is\nF_-(\ud835\udc24)=-v_xv_y\u0394  k^-2+2n n^2/|\u03f5(k)|^3,\nthus its Chern number is\n\n    C_-=1/2\u03c0\u222b d^2\ud835\udc24 F_-(\ud835\udc24)\n         =-n/2sgn(v_xv_y\u0394).\n\nwhere the sgn indicates the chirality of the Dirac boson.\nTherefore the band touching through the changing sign of \u0394 from positive to negative across the TPT\nleads to a change of Chern number \u0394 C_=-n sgn(v_xv_y).\n\n\nWhen there are multiple band touching points,\nthe total change of Chern number needs to sum up all\nthe contributions from all the band touching points.\n\nIn the superfluid phases, due to the BEC at k=0,\nthe Bogoliubov transformation matrix T_k diverges at k=0,\nthe Chern number of the lowest band C_1 may not be well-defined,\nbut those of the higher bands C_n>1 are usually well-defined, and quantized to be integers.\n<cit.>.\nIn this Letter, we are still able to calculate C_1 by excluding\nthe momentum k where the BEC resides.\nThe results are summarized in Fig. <ref>.\nWhen comparing  the non-interacting fermionic QAH model with the interacting bosonic QAH model,\nwe find that the bosonic interaction leads to new and additional patterns of topological bands.\nIn the following sections, we present the details of calculations leading to Fig.<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n5. The topology of the Bogoliubov band when h > h_c.\u2014\n\nIn the h>h_c case, the ground state is the Z-FM phase,\n\nthere are  N=2 energy bands,\nthe Bogoliubov transformation matrix T_k is a 4\u00d74 matrix.\nThe corresponding band structure \nis plotted in Fig.<ref> where\n\n    h_2    =\u221a(4t(4t+n_0U))\n    \n       h_1    =\u221a(2t(2t+n_0U))-2t\n\n\nWhen h=h_2, the two bands conically touch at k_R=(\u03c0,\u03c0);\nwhen h=h_1, they conically touch  at k_X=(\u03c0,0) and k_Y=(0,\u03c0).\n\n\nA direct evaluation of Eq.(<ref>) on the lattice shows that:\nwhen h > h_2, the lower band and the upper band Chern number are C_1=C_2=0 respectively;\nwhen h_1<h<h_2,  ( C_1, C_2)=(1,-1);\nwhen h<h_1,  ( C_1, C_2)=(-1,1).\n\n\n\nBelow, we construct continuum theories to confirm the change of the band Chern number.\n\nAt h=h_2, one needs to expand the Hamiltonian around k_R=(\u03c0,\u03c0),\nthe T_k at k_R tells the eigenmodes are\n\u03b1_1,R=\n(1/\u221a(8))[2(4+n_0U/t)^-1/4+(4+n_0U/t)^1/4]\u03c8_R\u2191\n-(1/\u221a(8))[2(4+n_0U/t)^-1/4-(4+n_0U/t)^1/4]\u03c8_R\u2191^\u2020\nand \u03b1_2,R=\u03c8_R\u2193, with the eigen-energy \u03c9_h2=2\u221a([b]4t(4t+n_0U))=2 h_2\nWhen h deviates slightly from h_2, defining k=k_R+q and\nprojecting the original Hamiltonian onto these eigenmodes lead to the effective Hamiltonian:\n\n    H_R=\u03c9_h2-vq_x\u03c3_x-vq_y\u03c3_y-\u0394\u03c3_z\n\nwhere omega_h2=2 h_2, \u0394=2(h-h_2),\nv=t_s\u221a([b]2[1+(8t+n_0U)/\u03c9_h2]). \nNote that the constant term omega_h2 shows it is an excited energy which has a direct experimental consequence <cit.>.\n\n\nThen the dispersion takes the form\n\n    \u03c9_1,2(q)=\u03c9_h2\u2213\u221a(\u0394^2+v^2(q_x^2+q_y^2)).\n\nThus the change of band Chern number is \u0394 C_1=- sgn(v^2)=-1.\nThis analysis is consistent with the numerical result C_1=0 at h>h_2 and  C_1=+1 at h<h_2, therefore 0-(+1)=-1.\n\nAt h=h_1, one needs to expand the Hamiltonian around k_X=(\u03c0,0) and k_Y=(0,\u03c0),\nthe T_k at k_X and k_Y tells the eigenmodes are\n\u03b1_1,X(Y)=\n(1/\u221a(8))[2(2+n_0U/t)^-1/4+(2+n_0U/t)^1/4]\u03c8_X(Y)\u2191\n-(1/\u221a(8))[2(2+n_0U/t)^-1/4-(2+n_0U/t)^1/4]\u03c8_X(Y)\u2191^\u2020\nand \u03b1_2,X(Y)=\u03c8_X(Y)\u2193,\nwith the eigen-energy \u03c9_h1=2\u221a([b]2t(2t+n_0U))=2h_1+4t.\nWhen h deviates slightly from h_1, defining k=k_X(Y)+q and\nprojecting the original Hamiltonian onto these eigenmodes lead to the effective Hamiltonian\n\n    H_X   =\u03c9_h1- vq_x\u03c3_x+vq_y\u03c3_y-\u0394\u03c3_z     \n    \n        H_Y   =\u03c9_h1+ vq_x\u03c3_x-vq_y\u03c3_y-\u0394\u03c3_z\n\nwhere \u03c9_h1=2h_1+4t, \u0394=2(h-h_1), v=t_s\u221a([b]2[1+(4t+n_0U)/\u03c9_h1]).\nAgain, the constant term omega_h2 shows it is an excited energy which has a direct experimental consequence <cit.>.\n\n\nThen the dispersion of H_X or H_Y takes the same form\n\n    \u03c9_1,2(q)=\u03c9_h1\u2213\u221a(\u0394^2+v^2(q_x^2+q_y^2)).\n\nThus the change of band Chern number is \u0394 C_1=2 sgn(v^2)=2.\nThis analysis is consistent with the numerical result C_1=+1 at h>h_1 and  C_1=-1 at h<h_1, therefore +1-(-1)=2.\n\n\n\n\nSince lim_U\u2192 0h_2=4t and lim_U\u2192 0h_1=0,\nthis result suggests that the topology of the Bogoliubov excitation bands at h>h_c\nis smoothly connecting to that of the non-interacting limit.\nBesides, the fact h_2=\u221a(4t(4t+n_0U))>4t at any U > 0\nsuggests that the region displaying a non-trivial topology ( with a non-zero Chern number) is enlarged with an increasing U>0.\n\n\nOne can also determine the relation between h_1 and h_c when U/t is small.\nWhen U/t is small, h_1=\u221a(2t(2t+n_0U))-2t\u223c n_0U/2, while h_c\u223c n_0U^2t_s^2/t^3 \u226a h_1.\nThus in the weak coupling limit U/t \u226a 1, there is always a window for h_c<h<h_1 as shown in Fig.1b.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. The topology of the Bogoliubov band when 0< h < h_c and the absence of the TPT across the QPT at h=h_c.\u2014\n\nIn the h<h_c case,\nthis corresponds to Eq.(9) and Eq.(10) in Ref.<cit.>.\nBecause of spontaneous translational symmetry breaking,\nwe have N=4 energy bands and T_k is an 8\u00d78 matrix.\n\n\nFrom the NOFQD analysis in Ref.<cit.>, we know the h=0 ground-state requires \u03b8=\u03c0/2,\nand 0<h<h_c ground-state requires \u03b8_h=arccos(h/h_c).\nWe substitute \u03b8=\u03b8_h back into the Eq.(<ref>), \nthen calculate the band Chern numbers via Eq.(<ref>).\nIn principle, there should be an additional term due to nearly order-from-quantum disorder (NOFQD) correction <cit.>,\nbut we expect this correction does not change the topology of the Bogoliubov bands.\nFrom the band structure shown in Fig.<ref>,\nwe find that the two lower bands touch, the two upper bands also touch,\nand there is always a band gap between the two groups when decreasing \u03b8_h from \u03c0/2 to 0\n(or equivalently, increasing h from 0 for h_c).\nNote that two lower/upper bands touch at the X point k_X=( \u03c0, 0 ),\nwhich is a momentum far away from k=0,\nthus the NOFQD effects ignored so far should not change the band touching behaviors.\nDue to the band touching, we need to consider the combination of the Chern numbers C_1+2 and C_3+4 when h<h_c.\nOur numerical evaluation of the integral Eq.(<ref>) gives (C_1+2,C_3+4)=(-1,+1).\nRecall the result of h just above h_c achieved in the last subsection also gives (C_1,C_2)=(-1,+1),\nwhich is the same pattern as (C_1+2,C_3+4)=(-1,+1).\nSo we conclude that there is not any change in the topology across the quantum phase transition at h=h_c.\n\n\n\n7. The TPT at h =0 and the absence of any QPT at h=0. \u2014\n\nAs shown in Fig.<ref>,  the topology changes at h=h_1 with the conic band crossings at k_X=(\u03c0,0) and k_Y=(0, \u03c0),\nalso at h=h_2 with the conic band crossing at k_R=(\u03c0, \u03c0). The origin of these TPTs can be traced back and mapped to the\ncorresponding non-interacting limit of fermions.\n\nIn this section, we show that there is also a conic band crossing at h=0 in Fig.<ref>(d) at some\nin-commensurate momentum (k_0x, k_0y )\nbetween the \u039b-point and X-point, which is not any high symmetry points.\nAs shown in Fig.<ref>, there are two such Dirac points in the RBZ.\nThe positions of the two Dirac points are in-commensurate and\nalso depend on t, t_s and U, so it comes from the interaction induced OFQD <cit.>.\nIn contrast to the TPTs at h= h_1 and h= h_2, the TPT at h=0  does not have any non-interacting analog.\n sl This is also the cental result achieved in this manuscript .\n\n\nAt h=0, the ground state wavefunction is the XY-AFM with \u03b8=0 and \u03d5=-\u03c0/4.\nSolving the band-touching condition \u03c9_2(k)=\u03c9_3(k) leads to the following three cases:\n(I) when n_0U/t<8t_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s),\ntwo solutions are K_1=(\u03c0-k_0,k_0) and K_2=(k_0,\u03c0-k_0),\n\nwith k_0=arcsin[\u221a(2)t n_0U/(t_s(8t+n_0U))]<\u03c0/2;\n(II) when n_0U/t>8t_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s),\ntwo solutions are P_1,2=\u00b1(p_0,p_0),\n\nwith p_0=arcsin[(4t/(8t+n_0U))\u221a(4t(4t+n_0U)/(4t^2-2t_s^2))]<\u03c0/2;\n(III) when n_0U/t=8t_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s),\nthe two solutions merge into just one at  \u039b=(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2).\nIntuitively, as shown in Fig.S2, when keeping h=0,\nincreasing n_0U/t from 0^+ to 8t_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s),\nthe \u03c9_2,3 conically touch at K_1,2;\nthen at n_0U/t=8t_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s), K_1 and K_2 collide at \u039b-point;\nfurther increasing n_0U/t, they bounce off along the two opposite directions along the perpendicular direction <cit.>,\nso \u03c9_2,3 conic touches at P_1,2.\n\n\n\nAround h=0, defining k=K_1,2+q or k=P_1,2+q,\nwe can similarly expand the Hamiltonian around the two minima of \u03c9_2,3 to\nfind the effective Hamiltonian:\n\n    H_1=\u03c9_0+c_\u2225 q_\u2225\n                +v_\u2225 q_\u2225\u03c3_x\n                +v_\u22a5 q_\u22a5\u03c3_y\n                -\u0394\u03c3_z, \n    \n        H_2=\u03c9_0-c_\u2225 q_\u2225\n                -v_\u2225 q_\u2225\u03c3_x\n                -v_\u22a5 q_\u22a5\u03c3_y\n                -\u0394\u03c3_z,\n\nwhere \u03c9_0=8t(4t+n_0U)/(8t+n_0U),\nq_\u2225=(q_x-q_y)/\u221a(2),q_\u22a5=(q_x+q_y)/\u221a(2),\nand \u0394=hn_0U\u221a(t/(4t+n_0U)) for regime (I),\nq_\u2225=(q_x+q_y)/\u221a(2),q_\u22a5=(q_x-q_y)/\u221a(2),\nand \u0394=4htt_s/\u221a(2t^2-t_s^2) for regime (II).\n\n\nThe effective velocities v_\u2225,v_\u22a5,c_\u2225>0 are proportional to cos(k_0) or cos(p_0) for regime (I) and regime (II) respectively\nand are listed in the appendix B.\n\n The dispersion of H_i, i=1,2 takes the form\n\n    \u03c9_2,3(q)=\u03c9_0-(-1)^i c_\u2225 q_\u2225\u2213\u221a(\u0394^2+v_\u2225^2q_\u2225^2+v_\u22a5^2q_\u22a5^2).\n\nIt is necessary to stress that there exists a Doppler shift term, the c term, in H_1,2,\nwhich is the salient feature unique to the OFQD induced TPT, not shared by any non-interacting counter-part.\nOf course, it does not affect the value of band Chern numbers.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the effective Hamiltonian Eq.(<ref>),\nEq.(<ref>) tells the change of band Chern number is \u0394 C=-2  sgn(v_\u2225 v_\u22a5)=-2\nwhen \u0394 changes from positive to negative.\nThis result is consistent with the numerical evaluation via Eq.(<ref>),\nwhich gives C_1+2=-1 at h>0 and C_1+2=+1 at h<0, therefore -1-(+1)=-2.\n\nAt h=0, in the colliding point n_0U/t=8t_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s),\nthe K_1 and K_2 merge at \u039b=(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2 )-point.\nExpanding around the \u039b-point leads to the dispersion:\n\n    \u03c9_2,3(q)=\u03c9_0(q) \u2213\u221a(u_1^2 q^4_\u22a5 +u_2 q^4_\u2225 +w q^2_\u2225 q^2_\u22a5),\n\n\nwhere u_1=t^2/(\u221a(2)t_s),\nu_2=t^2t_s/[\u221a(2)(2t^2-t_s^2)],\nw=t^2(t^2-t_s^2)/(2t^2-t_s^2),\nand \u03c9_0(q)=4t+2\u221a(2)t_s + DS where one can see the Doppler shift term\nDS= [t_s/\u221a(2)][-q^2_\u2225+ q^2_\u22a5 t_s^2/(2t^2-t_s^2)]  also gets to the quadratic order.\n\nNote that 4u_1^2u_2^2>w^2 is ensured by the condition 0<t_s<\u221a(2)t,\nso the square root is always positive define.\nSince w-term won't lead to a gap close, one can ignore w-term and rescale q\nto make \u03c9_2,3(q) isotropic.\nThe \u03c9_2,3(q)\u223c q^2 is consistent with the fact that v_\u2225, v_\u22a5, c_\u2225 in Eq.(<ref>)\nvanish as k_0 or p_0 approaching \u03c0/2.\nWhen h deviates from 0, the effective Hamiltonian belongs to n=2 case of Eq.(<ref>).\nThus, although there is only one band touching point with the monopole charge n=2,\nthe change of Chern number is still -2.\n\n\n\nIn short, regardless of the value of n_0U,\nthe change of the Chern number from h=0^+ to h=0^- is always -2.\nSo the scattering process in Fig. S1, is not a TPT.\n\n\n8. Dramatic differences between the non-interacting fermionic band structure and\n             the bosonic Bogoliubov band structure at the quadratic level.\u2014\n\n   It is important to stress some crucial differences between the\n   fermionic band structure and the bosonic Bogliubov band structure at the quadratic level and also pointed out the common mistakes\n   made in all the previous literatures to calculate the  edge modes associated with the bosonic Bogliubov band structure:\n\n   In the fermionic or bosonic QAH problem,  the Time reversal symmetry is broken,\n   the Chern number is not protected by any symmetry, its definition involves no symmetry requirement.\n   The former is really non-interacting, while the bosonic Bogoliubov band is non-interacting at the quadratic level only\n   where one dropped the cubic and quartic interactions and all the higher order interactions.\n   All these interactions are not important except near the QPT at h=h_c.\n   In fact, as shown by the RG analysis, near the QPT, the two quartic interaction in Eq.M32 are marginally irrelevant.\n   But both are relevant inside the XY-AFM phase and in fact, leads to the symmetry breaking inside the phase.\n\n\n   For the fermionic problem, there are always edge states associated with the  topological phases.\n   This is justified, because a single fermion operator never condenses.\n   One tempts to also calculate the edge modes\n   within the band gaps in Fig.<ref> and Fig.<ref> associated with the bosonic Bogoliubov band.\n   Unfortunately, this kind of calculation has mathematical meanings,\n   but  makes no physical sense: this is because Eq.M3 is based on the BEC at k=0  in the Z-FM phase,\n   Eq.M9 with the parametrization Eq. M11 are based on the BEC at both k=0 and Q=(\u03c0,\u03c0)\n   in the XY-AFM phase. Unfortunately, they are ill-defined in a strip geometry.\n   Ref.<cit.> and many other previous works,  just copied the same method\n   from its fermionic counterpart to evaluate edge modes associated with the bosonic Bogoliubov band:\n   They simply transfer the  quadratic Bogoliubov band in\n   momentum space to real space, then solve the edge modes in the strip geometry by putting a periodic boundary condition\n   along one direction, then the open boundary condition along the other.\n   Unfortunately, this approach is well-planned mathematically, but is not self-consistent physically, because it ignored the root of BEC which\n   leads to the quadratic bands in the first place. As stressed above, the BEC root\n   is ill-defined in the strip geometry. So it makes no physical sense to talk about the edge modes.\n   The claims made in some experimental works to measure the edge modes have no physical grounds.\n\n\n9. Experimental detections.\u2014\n  So far, the experiment<cit.> has detected the non-interacting fermionic Chern numbers Fig.1a\n  using the highly excited bosonic spinors, so it just mimic the single particle properties of the Hamiltonian Eq.1\n  using a spinor boson with SOC.\n  Its main purpose is to demonstrate a possible realization of the bosonic Hamiltonian Eq.1 using cold atoms.\n  The common drawbacks of most cold atom experiments is just to demonstrate a possibility to simulate  a Hamiltonian\n  which has been well studied in materials and claim the ability to tune the parameters.\n  But in reality, it is rare to go beyond just a simulation  to  demonstrate new many-body phenomenon or topological phenomena due to many-body interactions..\n\n  Here we showed that there are two kinds of  topological band structures\n  (1) The one in the regime | h| > |h_1 | is smoothly connected to the non-interacting fermionic one.\n  So it can also be called perturbative regime.\n   Even so, the two critical fields h_1,2 listed in Eq.<ref> still depends on the interaction n_0 U.\n   All the parameters in the effective Hamiltonian Eq.<ref> and <ref> also depend on the interaction n_0 U.\n  (2) The one in the  regime -h_1 < h < h_1 has no analog in the non-interacting counter-part, so it is\n      completely due to the many-body interaction. More specifically, due to the non-perturbative OFQD.\n      So it can also be called non-perturbative regime. It is also an experimentally easily accessible regime in the cold atom systems.\n\n  It is extremely important to push the already 6 year old experiment<cit.> beyond the single-particle picture:\n  to detect this novel purely interaction induced topological phenomena.\n  In contrast to the detections suggested in <cit.> which are all equilibrium properties in the ground states and low energy excitations, \n  here are the excited states near the high  energy \u03c9_h2,   \u03c9_h1 and \u03c9_0 in Eq.<ref>,<ref> and <ref> \n  near the high momentum R=(\u03c0,\u03c0) or X= (\u03c0,0), Y=(0,\u03c0) and tunable in-commensurate momenta K_1,2 or P_1,2 respectively <cit.>.\n  We suggest to also measure the scattering process of the two bosonic Dirac points at h=0 displayed in Fig.S1 by the \n  Bragg spectroscopy <cit.>  or the momentum resolved interband transitions <cit.> adapted to the excited states.\n\n\n10. Conclusions.\u2014\n  For any interacting Hamiltonian with a non-trivial topology in the non-interacting limit such as the QAH one Eq.1,\n  there are always two aspects quantum and topology.\n  The former focus on the ground states and quantum phase transitions which may only depend on the low energy excitations\n  around the band minima in the weak interaction limit. OFQD is needed to even determine the ground state.\n  NOFQD is needed to determine the QPT at h=h_c.\n  The latter focus on the global structure of the bands, therefore also  the excited states to capture the global topology <cit.>.\n  However, the Bogliubov quasi-particle band picture breaks down near the QPT near h=h_c where a RG analysis is needed to\n  capture all the physics well beyond the quadratic band picture.\n  \n However, as classified in <cit.>, there are two kinds of OFQD, the first response trivially to\n a deformation, no NOFQD phenomenon emerging from the OFQD. The second response highly non-trivially to\n a deformation and lead to  NOFQD phenomenon. It would be interesting to see if there are also two classes here, the first leads to a TPT, as is the case\n presented in this work, the second does not lead to any TPT. The two criterions coincide in the present case.\n It is also worthy to see if the two criterions coincide in other cases.\n\n The OFQD and the topological invariants such as Chern number seem are two very different concepts.\n The first concept is a completely many-body quantum phenomenon. While the latter is mainly a non-interacting topological phenomenon.\n Here we show that\n there are deep connections between the two in the context of the experimentally realized weakly interacting Quantum Anomalous Hall system\n of spinor bosons in an optical lattice. We expect this new effects could also be realized in\n frustrated quantum spin systems which leads to topological phase transitions of magnons.\n\nAcknowledgements \n\n J.

SYMMETRY ANALYSIS AND THE SCATTERING PROCESS OF THE TWO BOSONIC  DIRAC POINTS AT H=0 \n\n\n\nThe high symmetry points in the 1st Brillouin zone are defined as\n\n    \u0393=(0,0),\u00a0\u039b=(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2),\u00a0\n        R=(\u03c0,\u03c0),\u00a0 X=(\u03c0,0),\u00a0 Y=(0,\u03c0).\n\nTwo additional special k-points are defined as the band minima ( maxima ) of \u03c9_3(k)  ( \u03c9_2(k) ) when |h|<h_c,\nthey are functions of spin-orbit coupling t_s and the interaction U.\n\n\nAt h=0,  if the interaction strength U is sufficiently small n_0U/t<8t_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s),\nthe \u03c9_3(k) has two minima at\nk=K_1=(\u03c0-k_0,k_0) and k=K_2=(k_0,\u03c0-k_0),\nwhere\n\n    k_0=arcsin[\u221a(2)t n_0U/t_s(8t+n_0U)].\n\n\n\nWhen n_0U goes to 0, the k_0 will become 0,\nthus K_1 becomes X-point and K_2 becomes Y-point.\n\nAt h=0, if the interaction strength U is relatively large n_0U/t>8t_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s),\nthe \u03c9_3(k) has two minima at\nk=P_1=(+p_0,+p_0) and k=P_2=(-p_0,-p_0),\nwhere\n\n    p_0=arcsin[4t/8t+n_0U\u221a(4t(4t+n_0U)/4t^2-2t_s^2)]\n\n\nAt h=0, if  n_0U/t=8t_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s),\nthe \u03c9_3(k) has only one minima at k=\u039b=(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2) with the monopole charge n=2.\n\nIn summary, pictorially as illustrated in Fig.<ref>, at h=0,\nincreasing n_0U from 0^+ to the value greater than 8tt_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s),\nthe two minima of \u03c9_3(k) approach each other along the line k_0x+k_0y=\u03c0,\nthen collide at \u039b-point, then the two minima bounce off along the opposite direction along the perpendicular direction\nk_0x=k_0y.\n\n\nThe point group symmetry of the square lattice is C_4v.\nIn the presence of spin-orbit coupling,\nthe C_4v symmetry becomes [C_4\u00d7 C_4]_diag symmetry,\nwhich is a joint 4-fold rotation of spin and orbit.\nBesides, there are also two mirror symmetries M_1,2,\nwhich also inherit from the C_4v point group symmetry.\nThe mirror symmetry M_1\nis a composition of time reversal i \u2192 -i, \u03c3\u20d7\u2192 -\u03c3\u20d7, the orbit reflection k_x\u2194 k_y,\nand the spin rotation (\u03c3_x,\u03c3_y,\u03c3_z)\u2192(\u03c3_y,\u03c3_x,-\u03c3_z).\nThe mirror symmetry M_2\nis a composition of the orbit reflection k\u20d7\u2192  -k\u20d7,\nand the spin rotation (\u03c3_x,\u03c3_y,\u03c3_z)\u2192(-\u03c3_x,-\u03c3_y,\u03c3_z).\n\nWhen h > h_c, the ground state is the Z-FM superfluid phase where both [C_4\u00d7 C_4]_diag and M_1,2 symmetries are unbroken.\n\nWhen h < h_c, it is the XY-CAFM superfluid where the [C_4\u00d7 C_4]_diag\u2192 1 is broken while M_1,2 remain unbroken.\nIt is the M_1 symmetry which guarantees the two minima K_1=(k_0,\u03c0-k_0) and K_2=(\u03c0-k_0,k_0)\nare related by k_x\u2194 k_y.\nIt is the M_2 symmetry which guarantees the two minima P_1=(+p_0,+p_0) and P_2=(-p_0,-p_0)\nare related by k\u2194 -k. The colliding point  \u039b=(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2 ) is the mirror symmetric point which\nis invariant under both M_1 and M_2.  \n\nIt is constructive to compare the mirror symmetric point  \u039b=(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2 )   in the momentum space here with that\nin the SOC parameter space \u03b2=\u03c0/2 discussed in <cit.>. \nIn the former, the Hamiltonian which is the sum over all momenta  has the same symmetry, the Doppler shit term\nstill exists at a quadratic order, but non-vanishing.\nWhile in the latter, the Hamiltonian has an enlarged symmetry which dictates the exact vanishing of the Doppler shift term.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to compare the scattering process of the two bosonic Dirac points with the same chirality  in Fig.<ref> with\nthe annihilation process of the two fermionic Dirac points with the opposite chirality discussed in <cit.>.\nAs shown in this work, the former happens in the high energy modes, so it is not a QPT. It is not a TPT either.\nWhile the latter is both where various physical quantities satisfy various scaling functions.\nThe collision of two bosonic vortices with opposite vorticities in an expanding curved space-time was analyzed in <cit.> where\ntwo surface waves also emerge after the collision and head in opposite direction along the normal direction.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7  B.

In a sharp contrast, in the fermionic QAH under an injecting current discussed in <cit.>,\ndue to the absence of the  \u03c9_0 term, the sign change of the relative size drives a TPT.\n\nSolving the band touching condition \u03c9_2(k)=\u03c9_3(k)\nwithin the regime (II) n_0U/t>8t_s/(\u221a(2)t-t_s),\nwe obtain the two solutions P_1=+(k_0x,k_0y) and P_2=-(k_0x,k_0y),\nwhere\n\n    k_0x=k_0y=arcsin[4t/8t+n_0U\u221a(4t(4t+n_0U)/4t^2-2t_s^2)]=p_0.\n\nThe two solutions are related by the remaining M_2 symmetry.\nThe band touching happens at the high energy\n\u03c9_2(P_1)=\u03c9_3(P_1)=8t(4t+n_0U)/(8t+n_0U)=\u03c9_0> 4t+2\u221a(2)t_s.\n\nExpanding the \u03c9_2,3(k) near P_1,2 with k=P_1,2+q, we obtain\n\n    \u03c9_2,3(P_1+q)\n            =\u03c9_0\u2213\u221a(v_1^2 (q_x+q_y)^2+v_2^2 (q_x-q_y)^2)+c(q_x+q_y),  \n    \u03c9_2,3(P_2+q)\n            =\u03c9_0\u2213\u221a(v_1^2 (q_x+q_y)^2+v_2^2 (q_x-q_y)^2)-c(q_x+q_y),\n\n  where\n\n    v_1     =[2t(8t+n_0U)/(n_0U)] p_0,   \n    \n      v_2     =[t_s(8t+n_0U)/\u221a(8t(4t+n_0U))]cos p_0,   \n    \n       c      =[2t n_0U/(8t+n_0U)] p_0\n\nThe Doppler shift term is along the [11] direction,\nwhich is nothing but the \u201cbouncing-off\u201d direction in Fig.<ref>.\n\nIn summary, near the band touching point, we always have\n\n    \u03c9_2,3(K_i+q  or  P_i+q)\n            =\u03c9_0\u2213\u221a([b]v_\u2225^2 (q_\u2225)^2+v_\u22a5^2 (q_\u22a5)^2)-(-1)^i c_\u2225 q_\u2225,\n\nwhere i=1,2, q_\u2225=(q_x-q_y)/\u221a(2),q_\u22a5=(q_x+q_y)/\u221a(2) for regime (I),\nq_\u2225=(q_x+q_y)/\u221a(2),q_\u22a5=(q_x-q_y)/\u221a(2) for regime (II),\nand v_\u2225,v_\u22a5,c_\u2225 are easy to deduce from the previous expressions\nEq.<ref> and Eq.<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7  C. THE FOLDING OF THE TWO LOWER BANDS AND THE TWO UPPER BANDS AND\nTHE PHYSICAL MEANINGS OF C_I= C_1+2 AND C_II=C_3+4 AT H < H_C. \n\n\n Now we look at the band structures of the two lower bands and the two upper bounds.\nAt h=0, in the XY-AFM phase with c_0=1/\u221a(2) and c_\u03c0=e^-i\u03c0/4/\u221a(2),\nsolving the band touching condition \u03c9_1(k)=\u03c9_2(k) or \u03c9_3(k)=\u03c9_4(k),\nwe find the solutions k=(k_0x,k_0y) form a straight line {(k_0x,k_0y)|k_0x-k_0y=\u03c0}.\nThus, there is a line degeneracy between \u03c9_1 and \u03c9_2.\nThe Fig.<ref> shows that the \u03c9_1 and \u03c9_2 indeed touch along one reduced BZ edge.\n\n\n\nThe line degeneracy between \u03c9_1,2 and \u03c9_3,4 suggests that\nwe can unfold the two bands along [1 1\u0305] direction,\nby defining \u03a9_I(k)=\u03c9_2(k) if k in reduced BZ,\notherwise \u03a9_I(k)=\u03c9_1(k+Q') where Q'=(+\u03c0,-\u03c0).\nSimilarly, we define \u03a9_II(k)=\u03c9_3(k) if k in the reduced BZ,\notherwise \u03a9_II(k)=\u03c9_4(k+Q').\n\nThe unfolded band structures are plotted in Fig.<ref>.\nThus it is more nature to consider \u03c9_1,2 as one band and \u03c9_3,4 as the other band;\nthis is  the physical  reason we always consider a combination of band Chern numbers\nC_I= C_1+2 and C_II=C_3+4.\n\n\n\n99\n\n\nTQPT  Fadi Sun, Xiao-Lu Yu, Jinwu Ye, Heng Fan, W.
