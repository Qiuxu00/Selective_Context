Here, we show that linear thermoelectric effects in tunnel junctions (TJs) with Fe-based superconductors, not only address the dominance between particle and hole states, but even provide information about the superconducting order parameter symmetry. In particular, we observe that nodal order parameters present a maximal thermoelectric effect at lower temperatures than for nodeless cases.\nFinally, we show that superconducting TJs between iron-based and BCS superconductors could provide a thermoelectric efficiency ZT exceeding 6 with a linear Seebeck coefficient around S\u2248 800 \u03bcV/K at a few Kelvin. These results pave the way to novel thermoelectric machines based on multi-band superconductors.\n\n\nThermoelectric signatures of order-parameter symmetries in iron-based superconducting tunnel junctions\n    Roberta Citro 0000-0002-3896-4759\n    March 30, 2023\n======================================================================================================\n\n\n\nIntroduction -\nPhysical systems based on hybrid superconducting junctions have\ndemonstrated a great potential for energy management issues\u00a0<cit.>. Recently, they also attracted interest for their unexpectedly good thermoelectric (TE) performance\u00a0<cit.>, finding also a role in different quantum technology applications\u00a0<cit.>. In a two-terminal system,\na necessary condition for thermoelectricity in the linear\nregime, i.e., for a small voltage \u03b4 V and a small temperature bias \u03b4 T, is breaking of the particle-hole (PH) symmetry. \nA sizable linear TE effect, much larger than that commonly found in metallic structures, has been recently reported in SC-ferromagnet tunnel junctions (TJs)\u00a0<cit.>, due to the spin-dependent effective breaking of PH symmetry. \n\nHere, we show a robust linear TE effect in hybrid superconducting junctions with a multiband SC, namely, an iron-based SC (FeSC). Our results, beyond proving a linear TE effect with unconventional SCs, establish TE phenomena as a potential probe of the superconducting order parameter symmetries.\nIn fact, one of the central problems for unconventional SCs is the nature of the pairing mechanism, which is tightly connected to the order parameter symmetries\u00a0<cit.>. Pairing symmetry is known to be d-wave in cuprates, but is still unresolved for the FeSCs. They are unique among unconventional SCs, since different ordering phenomena are present in a multi-orbital scenario\u00a0<cit.>.\nIt was first theoretically predicted that FeAs-based high-temperature SCs have a sign change of the order parameter on the Fermi surface\u00a0<cit.>.\nExperimental evidence for FeSC seems to be favourable to s_\u00b1 pairing, implying that the electron- and hole-like bands both develop an s-wave superconducting state with opposite sign in order parameter\u00a0<cit.>.\nPoint contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy was also been applied to FeSCs to probe the order parameter symmetry\u00a0<cit.>. However, the results of these studies are not completely conclusive due to the complexity \nof the Andreev reflection spectra of a normal metal/ multiband-SC interface. \n\n\n\nNotably, bulk thermoelectrical measurements of FeSC have been reported for the normal state\u00a0<cit.>, although the analysis is quite intricate due to the competition of different mechanisms, such as phonon-\u00a0<cit.> and magnon-drag phenomena\u00a0<cit.>, in a multiband setting. The linear TE properties of a TJ between a FeSC and a normal metal allow identifying the strong intrinsic PH asymmetry in the FeSC density of states (DoS) in a quite direct way, also for the superconducting phase. We will also potentially discriminate between different order parameter symmetries. Furthermore, if the normal-metal is replaced by a Bardeen\u2013Cooper\u2013Schrieffer (BCS) SC, we observe also astounding TE figures of merit, which may be relevant for energy harvesting applications and quantum technologies\u00a0<cit.>. \n\nThermoelectrical transport - In order to address the physics of the FeSC, we focus on the linear TE properties of a TJ between FeSC and a normal metal (or a SC), see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a). \nThe linear-response coefficients of charge (I) and heat (Q\u0307) currents can be expressed in terms of the Onsager matrix\u00a0<cit.>\n\n    [  I; Q\u0307 ]=[   \u03c3   \u03b1;   \u03b1 \u03ba T;     ][   \u03b4 V; \u03b4 T/T ],\n\nwhere we assumed time reversal symmetry satisfied and a small voltage (temperature) bias \u03b4 V (\u03b4 T).\nHere, \u03b1 is the TE coefficient, while \u03c3 and \u03ba are the electric and thermal conductances, respectively. At the lowest order of tunneling, it is easy to express those linear coefficients as\n\n    [ \u03c3; \u03b1; \u03ba ]=G_T/e_-\u221e^\u221e[      e;      \u03b5; \u03b5^2/eT ]\ud835\udca9_L ( \u03b5 )\ud835\udca9_R ( \u03b5 )d\u03b5/4k_BTcosh^2 ( \u03b5/2k_BT  )\n\nin terms of the lead DoS, \ud835\udca9_j ( \u03f5 ) with j=L,R, where G_T is the normal-state conductance of the junction, -e is the electron charge, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant. \nIn our analysis, we take into account two different cases, i.e., a junction formed between a FeSC \ntunnel coupled with a normal lead, i.e., with \ud835\udca9_R(\u03f5)=1 being the energy-independent normalized DoS  in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), or alternatively with an s-wave SC, with \ud835\udca9_R ( \u03f5 )= | Re [ \u03f5 +i\u0393/\u221a((\u03f5 +i\u0393) ^2-\u0394^2 ( T  )) ]  |, where \u0393=\u03b3\u0394_0 is the phenomenological Dynes parameter\u00a0<cit.>, \u0394_0=1.764 k_BT_c, and T_c is the critical temperature of the BCS SC. In this model, it is also implicitly assumed that the Josephson coupling\u00a0<cit.> between the two superconducting leads is strongly suppressed\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nTo calculate the DoS of FeSC we rely on the two-orbital, four-band tight-binding approach by Raghu et.\u00a0al\u00a0<cit.>, which is the minimal model\u00a0<cit.>.\n The diagonalization of this tight-binding Hamiltonian model leads to eigenvalues that can be written in a compact form as\n\n    \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^d=\u221a((\u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^0)^2+|d\u20d7_\ud835\udc24,g|^2).\n\nHere \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^0=\u03be_\ud835\udc24+-\u03bc\u00b1\u221a(\u03be^2_\ud835\udc24xy+\u03be^2_\ud835\udc24-), \u03bc is the chemical potential, and d\u20d7_\ud835\udc24,g= ( 0,0,s_x^2y^2 ), where s_x^2y^2\u2261 s_\u00b1=\u0394_0^FeSCcos k_xcos k_y, \u0394_0^FeSC is the gap size, and |d\u20d7_\ud835\udc24|^2 represents the effective amplitude of the pairing interactions\u00a0<cit.>. For the explicit expressions of \u03be_\ud835\udc24\u00b1 and \u03be_\ud835\udc24xy we refer the reader to SM. We adopted the s_\u00b1-wave state which is the mostly accepted FeSC pairing state\u00a0<cit.>. However, the multiband character of FeSCs offers also chances for more exotic pairing states\u00a0<cit.>, and thus we will also discuss TE properties with other order parameter symmetries in the following. Hereafter, we took the interorbital hopping parameter | t_1 | as a standard unit of energy, and temperature will be measured in units of | t_1 |/k_B\u00a0<cit.>\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the FeSC total DoS turns out to be the sum of an electron-like [+, blue curve in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b)] and a hole-like [-, red curve in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b)] band contribution\u00a0<cit.>, \ud835\udca9_FeSC ( \u03b5 )=\ud835\udca9_FeSC^+  ( \u03b5 )+\ud835\udca9_FeSC^-  ( \u03b5 ), where\n\n    \ud835\udca9_FeSC^\u00b1 ( \u03b5 )=\u2211_\ud835\udc24\u03b5 + \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^0/2 \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^d{\u03b4 [ \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^d-\u03b5 ]-\u03b4 [ \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^d+\u03b5 ] }.\n\nNote also that the superconducting instability opens the gap symmetrically around the chemical potential, as illustrated in the inset of Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b) (see also SM).\n\n\nFigures of merit - In order to quantify the TE performance, it is usual to consider the Seebeck coefficient S=-\u03b1/(\u03c3 T) and thermodynamic efficiency with the dimensionless figure of merit ZT=S^2\u03c3 T/ [ \u03ba-\u03b1^2/(\u03c3 T) ]. A large value of ZT means better thermodynamic efficiency and if it tends to infinity, the efficiency of the device tends to the Carnot limit. In the following, we show how S and ZT of an FeSC-insulator-normal metal (FeSC-I-N) junction depend on the temperature, considering possible different values of \u0394_0^FeSC\u00a0<cit.>.\nand changing the doping level, \u03bc\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nFigures\u00a0<ref>(a) and (b) collect the S(T,\u0394_0^FeSC) and ZT(T,\u0394_0^FeSC) maps at the half-filling condition \u03bc= 1.54. For a given \u0394_0^FeSC, both the Seebeck coefficient and the TE efficiency behave non-monotonically, with a clear maximum that shifts towards gradually higher temperatures as \u0394_0^FeSC increases. Indeed,  \u0394_0^FeSC is the energy scale which mainly influences the optimal temperature that maximizes the TE effect. Furthermore, by increasing \u0394_0^FeSC the subgap states reduce, correspondingly requiring higher energies to achieve the same TE effect. The use of FeSCs is a further advantage over conventional SC configurations, since it allows operation at higher temperatures that provide a larger Seebeck coefficient.\n\nFigures\u00a0<ref>(c) and (d) show what happens when changing the doping level, keeping fixed \u0394_0^FeSC=0.1\u00a0<cit.>.\nThe FeSC DoS dependence on \u03bc is illustrated in SM. The S(T,\u03bc) map still reveals single-peaked profiles, but modifying the doping we observe the inversion of the Seebeck coefficient sign around \u03bc\u223c0.75, below (above) which S>0 (S<0) for the hole (electron) DoS contribution dominates. We note that the point at which the Seebeck coefficient changes sign differs from the half-filling condition.\nThe reason of that is the lack of symmetry between particle-like and hole-like bands for an FeSC in the energy window determined by the working temperatures.\n\nIn the cases discussed so far, we achieve Seebeck coefficients up to | S |\u223c 150\u00a0\u03bcV/K reaching also TE efficiencies of ZT\u223c 0.5. In the case of an undoped FeSC, \u03bc=1.54, with \u0394_0^FeSC=0.1, i.e., the red dashed lines in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a-d), the highest TE efficiency is reached at T\u22431.6\u00d710^-3, which may be a temperature around 2.8 K.\n\nWe remark that the maximum Seebeck coefficient we obtain is several orders of magnitude larger than that usually found in metallic structures at the same temperatures. However, the thermoelectricity of the FeSC-I-N junction outperforms magnetic TJs\u00a0<cit.> and is quite well comparable with hybrid SCs-ferromagnets TJs\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nIt is noteworthy to show that, if we replace the normal metal with a BCS SC with a gap \u0394_0, \nthe linear thermoelectricity can be further enhanced. This effect can be ascribed to the additional contribution of the conventional DoS peaks intertwined with the multi-band character of the FeSC.\nThus, in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(e) and (f) we present the S(T,\u0394_0) and ZT(T,\u0394_0) maps of a FeSC-insulator-SC (FeSC-I-S) TJ. In this case, we assume a specific FeSC with a given gap \u0394_0^FeSC=0.1 and we explore the TE response at different values of the BCS superconducting gap \u0394_0. A region of the (T,\u0394_0) parameter space emerges in which both Seebeck coefficient and TE efficiency increase significantly, even reaching the values | S |\u223c 870\u00a0\u03bcV/K and ZT\u223c6.5 at (T,\u0394_0)_max\u2243(0.63,5.3)\u00d710^-3. In natural units, these quantities correspond to T\u22431.8 K for a BCS SC with T_c\u22435.2 K\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder parameter symmetry detection - We show here that TE figures of merit are also a powerful tool for addressing order-parameter symmetry (OPS). We compare the temperature dependence of S and ZT of an FeSC-I-N TJ, with \u03bc=1.54 and \u0394_0^FeSC=0.1, taking into account different OPSs: we cover the three possible s-wave symmetries, i.e., the constant-gap case s_0, s_x^2y^2=\u0394_0^FeSCcos k_xcos k_y, and s_x^2+y^2=\u0394_0^FeSC(cos k_x+cos k_y)/2, and the two d-wave symmetries, i.e., d_xy=\u0394_0^FeSCsin k_xsin k_y and d_x^2-y^2=\u0394_0^FeSC(cos k_x-cos k_y)/2\u00a0<cit.>.\nSince it will be useful later on, we recall that the d_x^2-y^2, d_xy, and s_x^2+y^2 OPSs are nodal, while the others are nodeless\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nFigure\u00a0<ref> demonstrates that the TE figures of merit can provide valuable clues for determining the OPS of the system. Starting from the top of this figure, panel (a) takes a closer look at the different DoSs in play, with the inset serving to highlight the low-energy region. Figures\u00a0<ref>(b)-(c) illustrate the Seebeck coefficient S(T) and the TE efficiency ZT(T), both showing, in a semilog scale, bell-shaped, single-peaked profiles for each symmetry considered. It immediately stands out that the \u201cposition\u201d of these peaks depends strongly on the OPS: indeed, for the s_0 and s_x^2y^2 cases, both S and ZT are peaked roughly around T^ peak\u223c10^-3, while the other symmetries give S and ZT peaks centred on temperatures an order of magnitude lower. To give realistic numbers (here the subscript distinguishes symmetries), the S peak for nodeless OPS is located at T_x^2y^2^ peak\u22433.3 K(blue), T_0^ peak\u22431.4 K(violet), whereas for nodal cases one finds T_xy^ peak\u22430.13 K(yellow), T_x^2+y^2^ peak\u22430.12 K(green), and T_x^2-y^2^ peak\u22430.10 K(red). \nTo grasp this result, we recall that the energy window relevant for calculating the TE coefficients scales with temperature, i.e., | \u03b5|\u223c T (see SM for more details). \nFor instance, the energies considered in the inset of Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a) are essentially those where one should focus if T\u223c10^-4. Here, it is evident that only the d_xy, s_x^2+y^2 and d_x^2-y^2 DoSs (i.e., those showing ZTs peaked at these temperatures) are clearly non-zero. We see that nodeless FeSC pairings present maximal thermoelectricity (absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient) at relatively high temperatures. Instead, for the nodal cases, due to the presence of low energy states in the gap, the maximal thermoelectricity is observed at much lower temperature regimes. This result is quite robust against variations of the gap amplitude and hopping parameter values, as discussed in SM.\nFurthermore, we also see that the first two DoSs, i.e., the yellow and green curves, are unbalanced toward the hole side (\u03b5<0), unlike the third, i.e., the red curve, which appears to be slightly unbalanced toward particle side (\u03b5>0). This is directly reflected in the sign of S, which immediately tells us the PH asymmetry of the FeSC DoS and, therefore, S>0 (S<0) in the former (latter) case. This is clearly confirmed also by looking the PH asymmetry of the DoSs on the larger energy scale considered in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a). It is evident, for instance, that the s_0 and s_x^2y^2 OPSs, i.e., the violet and blue curves, respectively, are unbalanced to the right, i.e., the particle contribution dominates, thereby making S negative.\n\nWe emphasize that, in principle, the measurement of the PH asymmetry could be addressed by directly measuring the tunneling differential conductance. However, a systematic experimental asymmetry in the bias polarization of the junction cannot be easily excluded loosing sensitivity for small PH asymmetry. The linear thermoelectricity much safely returns this information in an independent way. Yet, we stress that the thermoelectrical signatures discussed in this Letter, being associated with the quasiparticle tunneling in the junction, are not affected by any phonon- or magnon-drag effects, which instead usually influence the bulk TE properties in the normal phase\u00a0<cit.>. \n\nConclusions - To summarize, we have demonstrated that an FeSC tunnel junction can show sizable TE efficiency, and that both the TE figure of merit and the Seebeck coefficient are found to be non-monotonic, single-peaked functions of temperature. Moreover, they can provide details on the underlying symmetry of the order parameter addressing the PH asymmetry of the DoS. In particular, the position of both the ZT and S peaks allows us to clearly distinguish nodal from \nnodeless symmetries. Furthermore, the sign of S provides further information on the asymmetry of PH, distinguishing cases where the TE efficiency is not discriminating, such as for the two d-waves symmetries. Our results also establish the relevance of multiband SCs for a novel generation of TE devices.\n\nAs a closing remark, we observe that the proposed approach\nmay be used for studying other quantum materials\u00a0<cit.>.\nMulti-orbital pairing approaches have been widely used also to shed light in other multiband SCs, such as ruthenates and nickelates, and insights about Hund-metal. \nTherefore, the TE-based investigation of tunneling junctions presented in this Letter complements the actual experimental techniques, finding a fertile ground for the study of novel quantum materials.\n \n\n\n \n\nF.G. acknowledges PNRR MUR project PE0000023-NQSTI for partial financial support.

The diagonalization of this tight-binding Hamiltonian model leads to eigenvalues that can be written in a compact form as\n\n    \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^d=\u221a((\u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^0)^2+|d\u20d7_\ud835\udc24,g|^2)        where        \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^0=\u03be_\ud835\udc24+-\u03bc\u00b1\u221a(\u03be^2_\ud835\udc24xy+\u03be^2_\ud835\udc24-).\n\nHere \u03bc is the chemical potential and d\u20d7_\ud835\udc24,g= ( 0,0,s_x^2y^2 ), where s_x^2y^2=\u0394_0^FeSCcos k_xcos k_y, \u0394_0^FeSC is the gap size.\nIn Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), we take into account the kinetic energy terms \u03be_\ud835\udc24\u03b1\u03b2 of a particle with momentum \ud835\udc24 changing the orbital from \u03b2 to \u03b1, given by \n\n    \u03be_\ud835\udc24\u00b1   =   (\u03be_\ud835\udc24xx\u00b1\u03be_\ud835\udc24yy)/2\n    \u03be_\ud835\udc24xx   =   -2t_1 cos (k_x)-2t_2 cos (k_y)-4 t_3 cos (k_x) cos (k_y),\n    \u03be_\ud835\udc24yy   =   -2t_2 cos (k_x)-2t_1 cos (k_y)-4 t_3 cos (k_x) cos (k_y),\n    \u03be_\ud835\udc24xy   =   -4 t_4 sin (k_x) sin (k_y).\n \nThe coefficients t_1 and t_2 are the intraorbital nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes, while t_3 and t_4 are the intraorbital and interorbital next-nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes, respectively\u00a0<cit.>. Different sets of hopping parameters correspond to different Fe-based superconductors (FeSC) (as in the manuscript, energies and temperatures are in units of | t_1 | and | t_1 |/k_B, respectively), i.e., (t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4) = (-1,1.3,-0.85-0.85) for iron pnictdes\u00a0<cit.>, or (t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4) = (-1,1.5,-1.2-0.95) for iron selenides\u00a0<cit.>. In this article, we focus primarily on iron pnictdes, although, as we show in the following, the main claims about the capability of thermoelectric (TE) measurements to resolve the pairing symmetry remain valid even using the hopping parameter values for selenides (even if for this kind of FeSC more sophisticated modelling has proven to be more effective\u00a0<cit.>). \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Density of states of a FeSC\n\nFor the sake of convenience, we rewrite the FeSC density of states (DoS) presented in the main text as\n\n    \ud835\udca9_FeSC^\u00b1 ( \u03b5 )=\u03b7/\u03c0^3\u222c_0^\u03c0dk_xdk_y\u03b5 + \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^0/2 \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^d [ 1/ (\u03b5 - \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^d  )^2+\u03b7^2\n    -1/ (\u03b5 + \u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^d  )^2+\u03b7^2 ],\n\nassuming a Lorentzian energy broadening like  i.e., \u03b4 ( \u03b5 -\u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^d )=\u03b7/ {\u03c0 [  ( \u03b5 -\u03b5_\ud835\udc24\u00b1^d )^2+\u03b7^2  ] }\u00a0<cit.> (we set \u03b7=0.01 in line with Ref.\u00a0<cit.>).\n\n\n\nThe behavior of the DoS, \ud835\udca9_FeSC ( \u03b5 ), at different values of \u03bc\u2208[0-2.5] and \u0394_0^FeSC=0.1 is shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. We clearly observe that by changing the doping level the DoS shifts, but leaving the gap opening around \u03b5=0. Moreover, as the doping increases, the DoSs gradually change from fully gap to gapless behaviour, as expected according to Ref.\u00a0<cit.> (see insets in Fig.\u00a0<ref> where a zoom is reported); in fact, for a large enough doping one finds a fully gapped hole-like Fermi surface, giving a gap in the DoS at low energies, and a partially gapped electron-like Fermi surface, giving a DOS growing quasilinearly around \u03b5=0. In order to illustrate this behavior, we include in the insets of Fig.\u00a0<ref> the DoSs \ud835\udca9_FeSC ( \u03b5 ) (solid line), \ud835\udca9^+_FeSC ( \u03b5 ) (dashed line), and \ud835\udca9^+_FeSC ( \u03b5 ) (dot-dashed line) within the energy range |\u03b5|\u2272 2 \u0394_0^FeSC. It is evident that for \u03bc=0, and 0.5, see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a-b), the electron-like contribution does not enter in play at low energies, and in fact the hole DoS contribution dominates (as discussed in the main text) the TE response of the system. For \u03bc=1, see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c), the electronic component starts to play a role and for \u03bc=1.5, see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(d), both the electrons and holes contributions effectively partake in the overall DoS and appear clearly gapped. The last two panels, for \u03bc=2 and 2.5, demonstrate that the quasi-linear behaviour at low energies of the DoS is entirely ascribable to the electronic component, the hole being still gapped. The sign of the TE coefficient roughly reconcile with this behaviour since for hole-dominated case it is typically positive where for electron-dominated is more negative. \n \nIt is also interesting to look at the behaviour of the quantity N^\u00b1(\u03bc)=\u00b1\u222b_0^\u00b1\u221e\ud835\udca9_FeSC ( \u03b5 ,\u03bc )d\u03b5; in particular, in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a) we focus on the difference N^-(\u03bc)-N^+(\u03bc) as a function of \u03bc. We recall that the undoped compound, having the half-filled, two electrons per site configuration, requires \u03bc= 1.54, namely, the value largely used in the manuscript, at which N^--N^+=0. For \u03bc lower (higher) than the half-filling value, the positive (negative) energy portion of DoS predominates, being N^--N^+<0 (N^--N^+>0). A change of slope is evident for the threshold value \u03bc^th\u223c1.15; this is due to the fact that, increasing the doping level, the electron-like band starts to be strongly occupied (e.g., see right panels of Fig.\u00a0<ref>). This mechanism  explains why for \u03bc\u223c\u03bc^th there is a strong change in the \"movement\" of the TE peak with respect to the doping illustrated in Figs.\u00a02(c) and\u00a0(d) of the main text. In particular, we see that for \u03bc\u2273\u03bc^th (\u03bc\u2272\u03bc^th) the TE peak shifts towards lower (higher) temperatures increasing the electron doping. At lowest doping the thermoelectricity changes sign since it is hole dominated and electronic-like band is almost completely depleted. \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 TE coefficients of a tunneling barrier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is useful to express the TE coefficient, \u03b1, and the electric and the thermal conductances, \u03c3 and \u03ba, \n\n    [ \u03c3; \u03b1; \u03ba ]=G_T/e_-\u221e^\u221e[      e;      \u03b5; \u03b5^2/eT ]\ud835\udca9_L ( \u03b5 )\ud835\udca9_R ( \u03b5 )d\u03b5/4k_BTcosh^2 ( \u03b5/2k_BT  ),\n\nin such a way as to group all terms excluding DoSs into \"weight functions\", that is\n\n    x=G_T/e\u222b_-\u221e^\u221eW_x(\u03b5,T)\ud835\udca9_L ( \u03b5)\ud835\udca9_R ( \u03b5)d\u03b5    with     x=(\u03c3,\u03b1,\u03ba).\n\nThe behavior of the weight functions, W_x ( \u03b5, T ) with x=(\u03c3,\u03b1,\u03ba), normalised to their maximum value, is shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b). We immediately note that all three functions quickly go to zero for | \u03b5|\u2273 10 T, thus limiting the temperature range relevant for the calculation of linear TE coefficients. We also observe that \u03c3 and \u03ba are even functions of energy, unlike \u03b1, which is odd; from this characteristic derives the dependence of the sign of the Seebeck coefficient, S=-\u03b1/(\u03c3 T), on the predominant particle/hole contribution.\n \n\n\n\nIn Fig.\u00a0<ref> we show how TE coefficient, \u03b1, and the electric and the thermal conductances, \u03c3 and \u03ba, vary in the case discussed in Fig.\u00a02 of the main text (note, in Fig.\u00a0<ref> we are showing dimensionless normalised quantities). In particular: panels (a), (b), and (c) show \u03b1(T,\u0394_0^FeSC), \u03c3(T,\u0394_0^FeSC), and \u03ba(T,\u0394_0^FeSC) at \u03bc=1.54, while panels (d), (e), and (f) show \u03b1(T,\u03bc), \u03c3(T,\u03bc), and \u03ba(T,\u03bc) at \u0394_0^FeSC=0.1, in the case of a FeSC-I-N junction. Instead, panels (g), (h), and (i) \u03b1(T,\u0394_0), \u03c3(T,\u0394_0), and \u03ba(T,\u0394_0) at \u03bc=1.54 and \u0394_0^FeSC=0.1, in the case of a FeSC-I-S junction. This figure allows us to definitively state that, taken individually, these quantities are unable to provide the information that instead emerges clearly when they are recombined to form the Seebeck coefficient, S, and figure of merit, ZT, as shown in Fig.\u00a02 of the article. Finally, we observe also that the black region in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(d) indicates negative \u03b1 values, giving S>0.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 TE effect and other FeSC order parameter symmetries\n\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we also show how the Seebeck coefficient and TE efficiency behave considering a d_xy pairing symmetry. As can be seen from Fig.\u00a0<ref>, the main characteristics discussed in the manuscript for s_\u00b1-symmetry are also evident here, with a clear shift towards lower temperatures, in line with what was discussed in Fig.\u00a03 in the main text for a nodal case. Another quite evident difference is that the sign of S is reversed from what is shown in Fig.\u00a02 of the main article, see Figs.\u00a0<ref>(a)-(c)-(e): this indicates that where hole contributions for s_\u00b1-symmetry is predominant, particle contributions now prevail (and vice versa). In the case of an FeSC-I-N junction, we also note that the threshold doping value around which the sign of S changes is somewhat higher than in the case shown in the article (the switch occurs roughly at \u03bc\u223c1.25), see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b). Finally, we observe that the maximum values obtained for S and ZT in this case are practically the same as those obtained in the case of s_\u00b1 pairing symmetry. However, considering an FeSC-I-S junction, the region of the parameter space where these maxima are reached is different, being the ZT peak in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(f) located at (T,\u0394_0)_max\u2243(0.23,2.1)\u00d710^-4; in other words, in this case the maximum TE efficiency would be attainable for a superconducting tunnel junction at T\u224340 mK formed between a FeSC and a SC with T_c\u2243210 mK.\n\n\nFinally, Fig.\u00a0<ref> show that the TE of a tunnel junction resolves better between nodal and nodeless cases increasing the gap value, see panels (a) and (b) for \u0394_0^FeSC=0.05 and 0.2, respectively. Furthermore, we tested the results also with the hopping parameters of FeSC selenides, see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c) for \u0394_0^FeSC=0.1 and \u03bc=1.54. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nfxundefined [1]\n ifx#1\n\nfnum [1]\n #1firstoftwo\n secondoftwo\n \nfx [1]\n #1firstoftwo\n secondoftwo\n \n\n\n\n\n\nnoop [0]secondoftwo\n\nref[1]@startlink#1@href\nhref[1]#1@endlink\nanitize@url [0]`\n12`$12`&12`#12`1\u03022`_12`%12\nstartlink[1]\nendlink[0]\n\nrl [1]href #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@bib@innerbibempty\n\n[Raghu et\u00a0al.(2008)Raghu,\n  Qi, Liu, Scalapino, and  Zhang]Rag08\n  author author S.\u00a0Raghu, author X.-L.
