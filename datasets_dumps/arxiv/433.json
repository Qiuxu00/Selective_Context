A motion planning algorithm on X is a function which, to any pair of configurations (C_1,C_2)\u2208 X\u00d7 X, assigns a continuous motion \u03bc of the system, so that \u03bc starts at the given initial state C_1 and ends at the final desired state C_2. The fundamental problem in robotics, the motion planning problem, deals with how to provide, to any given autonomous system, with a motion planning algorithm. \n\nFor practical purposes, a motion planning algorithm should depend continuously on the pair of points (C_1,C_2). Indeed, if the autonomous system performs within a noisy environment, absence of continuity could lead to instability issues in the behavior of the motion planning algorithm. Unfortunately, a (global) continuous motion planning algorithm on a space X exists if and only if X is contractible. Yet, if X is not contractible, we could care about finding local continuous motion planning algorithms, i.e., motion planning algorithms s defined only on a certain open subset of X\u00d7 X, to which we refer as the domain of definition of s. In these terms, a motion planner on X is a set of local continuous motion planning algorithms whose domains of definition cover X\u00d7 X. The topological complexity of X <cit.>, TC(X), is then the minimal cardinality among motion planners on X, while a motion planner on X is said to be optimal if its cardinality is TC(X). The design of explicit motion planners that are reasonably close to optimal is one of the challenges of modern robotics (see, for example Latombe <cit.> and LaValle <cit.>). \n\nIn more detail, the components of the motion planning problem via topological complexity are as follows (see <cit.>):\n Ingredients in the motion planning problem via topological complexity:\n\n    \n  * The obstacle-free configuration space X. The topology of this space is assumed to be fully understood in advance. \n    \n  * Query pairs C=(C_1,C_2)\u2208 X\u00d7 X. The point C_1\u2208 X is designated as the initial configuration of the query. The point C_2\u2208 X is designated as the goal configuration.  \n\nIn the above setting, the goal is to either describe a motion planner, i.e., describe\nenumi2\n\n  * An open covering U={U_1,\u2026,U_k} of X\u00d7 X;\n\n  * For each i\u2208{1,\u2026,k}, a local continuous motion planning algorithm, i.e., a continuous map s_i U_i\u2192 X^[0,1] satisfying \n    s_i(C)(j)=C_j+1,   j=0,1\n for any C=(C_1,C_2)\u2208 U_i (here X^[0,1] stands for the free-path space on X joint with the compact-open topology),\n\nor, else, report that such an planner does not exist.\n\n\nLet X be a smooth manifold and Z\u2282 X be a submanifold with codimension 1.\n\n    A path \u0393:[0,1]\u2192 X is semi-transversal to Z, denoted by \u0393\u22d4_s Z, if \u0393(t)\u2208 Z with t\u2208 (0,1), implies that \u0393 is smooth in t and \u27e8\u0393'(t)\u27e9+T_\u0393(t)Z=T_\u0393(t)X (equivalently, \u0393'(t)\u2209 T_\u0393(t)Z), where \u27e8\u0393'(t)\u27e9 is the subspace generated by \u0393'(t). Note that, if \u0393 is transversal to Z (we will denote \u0393\u22d4 Z) then \u0393\u22d4_s Z. \n\n\n\n\n    The path \u0393 [0,1]\u2192\u211d^2 given by \n    \u0393(t)=\n        (1-2t)(-1,0)+2t(0,1),   for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/2;\n    \n        (2-2t)(0,1)+(1-2t)(1,0),   for 1/2\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n is semi-transversal to Z={(x,x):\u00a0x\u2208\u211d} but is not transversal to Z. In fact, \u0393 is not smooth in t=1/2.\n\n\n\n    [x=.9cm,y=.9cm]\n    (-2,0)\u2013(2,0);\n    (0,-2)\u2013(0,2);\n    (-2,-2)\u2013(2,2);\n    [->](-1,0)\u2013(0,1); \n    [->](0,1)\u2013(1,0); \n     [below] at (-1,0) (-1,0);\n     [below] at (1,0) (1,0);\n     [above] at (0,1) (0,1);\n     [above] at (1,1) Z;\n\n\nInvestigation of the problem of transversal motion planners for a robot, with state space X, leads us to study the pair (X,Z), where Z is a submanifold of X with codimension 1. The submanifold Z may characterize some desired geometry for the motion planning algorithm.  A (local) transversal motion planning algorithm in X with respect to Z assigns to any pair of configurations (C_1,C_2) in (an open set of) X\u00d7 X a path of configurations \n    \u0393(t)\u2208 X,\u00a0\u00a0t\u2208 [0,1],\n  such that \u0393(i)=C_i+1 for i=0, 1 and \u0393\u22d4_s Z.\n\nIn this work we introduce the notion of transversal topological complexity together with basic results about this numerical invariant. Proposition\u00a0<ref> together with Example\u00a0<ref> give the motivation to introduce the tranversal topological complexity (Definition\u00a0<ref>). Examples\u00a0<ref> and <ref> present transversal algorithms in euclidean spaces. We define the notion of transversal LS category (Definition\u00a0<ref>) and present a lower bound for transversal complexity in terms of transversal LS category (Proposition\u00a0<ref>). Proposition\u00a0<ref> shows an explicit construction of transversal algorithms through diffeomorphisms. Examples\u00a0<ref> and <ref> show that submanifold Z may imply some desired geometry for the motion planning algorithm.  \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 TRANSVERSAL TOPOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY\n\nIn this section we present the notion of transversal topological complexity (Definition\u00a0<ref>) together with basic results about this numerical invariant (Lemma\u00a0<ref> and Propositions\u00a0<ref> and\u00a0<ref>). Several examples are presented to illustrate the result arising in this field (Examples\u00a0<ref>,\u00a0<ref>,\u00a0<ref> and\u00a0<ref>). Examples\u00a0<ref> and <ref> show that submanifold Z may imply some desired geometry for the motion planning algorithm.  \n\nLet X^[0,1] stand for the free-path space of a topological space X. Recall that Farber's topological complexity TC(X) is the sectional category of the end-points evaluation fibration e_2^X X^[0,1]\u2192 X\u00d7 X, e_2^X(\u03b3)=(\u03b3(0),\u03b3(1)). We use sectional category of a fibration p E\u2192 B in the non reduced sense, i.e., it is the minimal number of open sets covering B and on each of which p admits a local continuous section.\n\n From the Whitney approximation theorem <cit.> we obtain the following statement.\n\n\n   Let X and Y be smooth manifolds (without boundary), f,g:X\u2192 Y be smooth maps such that there is a continuous homotopy H:X\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 Y with H_0=f and H_1=g, then there exists a smooth homotopy G:X\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 Y with G_0=f and G_1=g. \n\n\nFrom <cit.> we have the following statement.\n\n\nLet f:X\u2192 Y be a smooth map and Z\u2282 Y be a submanifold such that the boundary map \u2202 f:\u2202 X\u2192 Y is transversal to Z, then there exists a smooth map g:X\u2192 Y homotopic to f such that \u2202 g=\u2202 f and g\u22d4 Z.\n\n\n\nThen, we have the following statement\n\n\nLet X be a smooth manifold and Z\u2282 X be a submanifold of codimension 1, then TC(X) coincides with the smallest positive integer k for which  the product X\u00d7 X is covered by k open subsets X\u00d7 X=U_1\u222a\u22ef\u222a U_k such that for any i=1,2,\u2026,k there exists a continuous section s_i:U_i\u2192 X^[0,1] of e_2^X \nover U_i (i.e., e_2^X\u2218 s_i=incl_U_i) and s_i\u22d4 Z, where s_i U_i\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X is given by s_i(u)=s_i(u)(t) for any u\u2208 U_i and t\u2208 [0,1].     \n\n\n    For U\u2282 X\u00d7 X and s:U\u2192 X^[0,1] a continuous local algorithm, consider s:U\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X,\u00a0s((x,y),t)=s(x,y)(t). Note that, s is a continuos homotopy with s_0=\u03c0_1 and s_1=\u03c0_2, where \u03c0_j is the projection to the j-th factor. By Lemma\u00a0<ref>, there exists a smooth homotopy G:U\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X with G_0=\u03c0_1 and G_1=\u03c0_2. Note that the boundary map \u2202 G=\u03c0_1\u2294\u03c0_2 is transversal to Z, then by Lemma\u00a0<ref>, there exists a smooth map F:U\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X homotopic to G such that \u2202 F=\u2202 G (and thus, F_0=\u03c0_1 and F_1=\u03c0_2) and F\u22d4 Z. Then, the map \u03c3 U\u2192  X^[0,1] given by \u03c3(x,y)(t)=F((x,y),t) satisfies the conditions of the proposition. Thus, the proposition holds. \n    \n\n\nNote that, if F:U\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X is transversal to Z with U\u2282 X\u00d7 X does not implies that F_u [0,1]\u2192 X,\u00a0t\u21a6 F_u(t)=F(u,t), is transversal to Z for any u\u2208 U. To see this, we have the following example. \n\n\n    Consider the pair (\u211d^2,S^1) and the smooth map F\u211d^2\u00d7\u211d^2\u00d7[0,1]\u2192\u211d^2 given by F((C_1,C_2),t)=(1-t)C_1+tC_2. Note that, F\u22d4 S^1 but F_((1,1),(-1,1)) [0,1]\u2192\u211d^2,\u00a0F_((1,1),(-1,1))(t)=(1-2t,1), is not transversal to S^1.\n\n\nProposition\u00a0<ref> says that Farber's topological complexity of X coincides with the complexity of designing smooth homotopies F:U\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X with F_0=\u03c0_1 and F_1=\u03c0_2 such that F\u22d4 Z. However, Example\u00a0<ref> motives the following definition. \n\n\nThe transversal topological complexity TTC(X,Z) of a path-connected smooth manifold (without boundary) X with respect to a submanifold (without boundary) Z with codimension 1 is the smallest positive integer TTC(X,Z)=k for which  the product X\u00d7 X is covered by k open subsets X\u00d7 X=U_1\u222a\u22ef\u222a U_k such that for any i=1,2,\u2026,k there exists a continuous section s_i:U_i\u2192 X^[0,1] of e_2^X over U_i (i.e., e_2^X\u2218 s_i=incl_U_i) and s_i(x,y)\u22d4_s Z for any (x,y)\u2208 U_i. We call such a collection of local sections a transversal motion planner with k \ndomains of continuity. If no such k exists, we set TTC(X,Z)=\u221e. \n\n\n\nNote that TC(X)\u2264TTC(X,Z) for any smooth manifold X and any submanifold Z\u2282 X with codimension 1. \n\n\n\nConsider the pair (\u211d^n, \u211d^n-1), with the latter understood as the submanifold \u211d^n-1\u00d7{0}\u2282\u211d^n. We claim that the transversal topological complexity of this pair is 1. Indeed, consider the (global) algorithm s:\u211d^n\u00d7\u211d^n\u2192 (\u211d^n)^[0,1] defined by \n    s(C_1,C_2)(t)=\n            (1-2t)C_1+2te_n,   for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/2;\n    \n           (2-2t)e_n+(2t-1)C_2,   for 1/2\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n where e_n=(0,\u2026,0,1)\u2208\u211d^n. \n\nThis map (see Figure\u00a0<ref>) is continuous and satisfies the transversal condition: If s(C_1,C_2)(t)\u2208\u211d^n-1 with t\u2208 (0,1), \nthen \n    s'(C_1,C_2)(t)=\n            2(e_n-C_1),   for 0< t<1/2;\n    \n           2(C_2-e_n),   for 1/2< t<1;\n \nHence, s'(C_1,C_2)(t)\u2209\u211d^n-1. \n\n\n\n\n\n    For the pair (\u211d^d+1,_i=1^nS^d_i(0)) where S^d_i(0) is the d-dimensional sphere with center 0 and radius i, i=1,\u2026,n, then we have that the transversal topological complexity TTC(\u211d^d+1,_i=1^nS^d_i(0))=1. To check this, we have that the map s:\u211d^d+1\u00d7\u211d^d+1\u2192(\u211d^d+1)^[0,1] given by \n    s(C_1,C_2)(t)=\n            (1-2t)C_1,   for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/2;\n    \n            (2t-1)C_2,   for 1/2\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n defines a global continuous transversal algorithm in \u211d^d+1 with respect to _i=1^nS^d_i(0) (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). \n\n\n\n\nLet X be a smooth manifold, Z\u2282 X be a 1-codimension submanifold and x_0\u2208 X\u2216 Z. We have the following statement.\n \n \n There exists a continuous transversal algorithm s:X\u00d7 X\u2192 X^[0,1] with respect to Z if and only if there exists a continuous nulhomotopy H:X\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X with H_0=1_X, H_1=x_0 and H(x,-)\u22d4_s Z for any x\u2208 X.\n\n\n Suppose that s:X\u00d7 X\u2192 X^[0,1] is a continuous transversal algorithm with respect to Z. The map H:X\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X given by H(x,t)=s(x,x_0)(t) defines a continuous nulhomotopy with H_0=1_X, H_1=x_0 and H(x,-)\u22d4_s Z for any x\u2208 X.\n\nNow, suppose that H:X\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X is a continuous nulhomotopy with H_0=1_X, H_1=x_0 and H(x,-)\u22d4_s Z for any x\u2208 X. The map s:X\u00d7 X\u2192 X^[0,1] given by \n    s(x,y)(t)=\n            H(x,2t),   for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/2;\n    \n            H(y,2-2t),   for 1/2\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n defines a continuous transversal algorithm with respect to Z (here we use that x_0\u2209 Z).\n\n\nLemma\u00a0<ref> implies the notion of transversal LS category.\n\n\n    Let X be a smooth manifold and Z\u2282 X be a 1-codimension submanifold. The transversal LS category of X with respect to Z, denoted by Tcat(X,Z), is the smallest positive integer k for which the space X is covered by k open subsets X=U_1\u222a\u22ef\u222a U_k such that for each i=1,2,\u2026,k there exists a continuous map H:U_i\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X with H_0=incl_U_i, H_1=constant and H(x,-)\u22d4_s Z for any x\u2208 U_i. If no such k exists, we set Tcat(X,Z)=\u221e. \n\n\nNote that Tcat(X,Z)\u2265cat(X), where cat(X) is the LS category of X. From\u00a0<cit.>, the LS category of X is the least integer k such that X can be covered by k open sets, all of which are contractible within X. \n\n\nConsider the pair (\u211d^2,S^1_1\u2294 S^1_2), where S^1_1 is the 1-sphere with center O_1=(-2,0) and S^1_2 is the 1-sphere with center O_2=(2,0) (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). We have that Tcat(\u211d^2,S^1_1\u2294 S^1_2)=2.\n  We will prove Tcat(\u211d^2,S^1_1\u2294 S^1_2)\u22642, the lower bound is a technical exercise which we leave to the reader. Consider the open sets:\n   \n    U_1   =\u03c0^-1(-\u221e,1/2),\n    \n           U_2   =\u03c0^-1(-1/2,+\u221e),\n where \u03c0:\u211d^2\u2192\u211d is the natural projection \u03c0(x,y)=(x,0). Note that U_1\u222a U_2=\u211d^2. Moreover, for each i=1,2, we can consider the map H_i:U_i\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192\u211d^2 given by \n    H_i(x,t)   =(1-t)x+tO_i.\n Note that H_i(x,0)=x, H(x,1)=O_i and H_i(x,-)\u22d4_s S^1_1\u2294 S^1_2 for any x\u2208 U_i. Thus, Tcat(\u211d^2,S^1_1\u2294 S^1_2)\u2264 2 and therefore Tcat(\u211d^2,S^1_1\u2294 S^1_2)=2.\n\n\n\n\nThe following statement presents a lower bound for transversal complexity in terms of transversal LS category.\n\n\n   Let X be a smooth manifold and Z\u2282 X be a 1-codimension submanifold.

For U\u2282 X\u00d7 X and s U\u2192 X^[0,1] satisfying e_2^X\u2218 s=incl_U and s(x,y)\u22d4_s Z for any (x,y)\u2208 U, consider V=i_0^-1(U) and the map H:V\u00d7 [0,1]\u2192 X given by H(x,t)=s(x,x_0)(t) defines a continuous map with H_0=incl_V, H_1=x_0 and H(x,-)\u22d4_s Z for any x\u2208 U. Hence, we conclude that TTC(X,Z)\u2265Tcat(X,Z).  \n\n\n\n   Consider the pair (\u211d^2,S^1_1\u2294 S^1_2), where S^1_1 is the 1-sphere with center (-2,0) and S^1_2 is the 1-sphere with center (2,0). We have that the transversal topological complexity 2\u2264TTC(\u211d^2,S^1_1\u2294 S^1_2)\u2264 4. In fact, the first inequality follows from Example\u00a0<ref> together with Proposition\u00a0<ref>. To check the second inequality, we can consider the open sets: \n   \n    A   =\u22c2_i=1^4\u03c0^-1(\u211d\u2216{a_i}),\n    \n           B   =_i=1^4\u03c0^-1(a_i-1/4,a_i+1/4),\n\n    where \u03c0:\u211d^2\u2192\u211d is the natural projection \u03c0(x,y)=(x,0) and a_1=(-3,0), a_2=(-1,0), a_3=(1,0) and a_4=(2,0). \n  \n   Note that A\u222a B=\u211d^2 and thus (A\u00d7 A)\u222a(A\u00d7 B)\u222a(B\u00d7 A)\u222a(B\u00d7 B)=\u211d^2\u00d7\u211d^2. Moreover, \n    A\u00d7 B   =_j=1^4A\u00d7\u03c0^-1(a_j-1/4,a_j+1/4),\n    \n           B\u00d7 A   =_i=1^4\u03c0^-1(a_i-1/4,a_i+1/4)\u00d7 A,\n    \n           B\u00d7 B   =_i,j=1^4\u03c0^-1(a_i-1/4,a_i+1/4)\u00d7\u03c0^-1(a_j-1/4,a_j+1/4),\n\n   \n   The following maps \n    s    A\u00d7 A\u2192(\u211d^2)^[0,1],\n    \n           s_A,j    A\u00d7\u03c0^-1(a_j-1/4,a_j+1/4)\u2192(\u211d^2)^[0,1],\n    \n           s_i,A   \u03c0^-1(a_i-1/4,a_i+1/4)\u00d7 A\u2192(\u211d^2)^[0,1],\n    \n           s_i,j   \u03c0^-1(a_i-1/4,a_i+1/4)\u00d7\u03c0^-1(a_j-1/4,a_j+1/4)\u2192(\u211d^2)^[0,1],\n given by \n    s(C_1,C_2)(t)   =\n         (1-3t)C_1+3t\u03c0(C_1),    for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/3;\n      \n         (2-3t)\u03c0(C_1)+(3t-1)\u03c0(C_2),    for 1/3\u2264 t\u2264 2/3;\n      \n         (3-3t)\u03c0(C_2)+(3t-2)C_2,    for 2/3\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n    \n    \n       s_A,j(C_1,C_2)(t)   =\n         (1-3t)C_1+3t\u03c0(C_1),    for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/3;\n      \n         (2-3t)\u03c0(C_1)+(3t-1)d_j,    for 1/3\u2264 t\u2264 2/3;\n      \n         (3-3t)d_j+(3t-2)C_2,    for 2/3\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n    \n    \n       s_i,A(C_1,C_2)(t)   =\n         (1-3t)C_1+3td_i,    for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/3;\n      \n         (2-3t)d_i+(3t-1)\u03c0(C_2),    for 1/3\u2264 t\u2264 2/3;\n      \n         (3-3t)\u03c0(C_2)+(3t-2)C_2,    for 2/3\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n    \n    \n       s_i,j(C_1,C_2)(t)   =\n         (1-3t)C_1+3td_i,    for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/3;\n      \n         (2-3t)d_i+(3t-1)d_j,    for 1/3\u2264 t\u2264 2/3;\n      \n         (3-3t)d_j+(3t-2)C_2,    for 2/3\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n where d_1=d_2=(-2,0) and d_3=d_4=(2,0), define local continuous transversal algorithms with respect to S^1_1\u2294 S^1_2. We have thus constructed a transversal motion planner in \u211d^2 with respect to S^1_1\u2294 S^1_2 having 4 regions of continuity A\u00d7 A, A\u00d7 B, B\u00d7 A, B\u00d7 B. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following result is technical. \n\nLet h:M\u2192 N be a diffeomorphism. If W\u2282 N is a submanifold with codimension 1, then Z=h^-1(W)\u2282 M is also a submanifold with codimension 1.\n\n\nThen, the next statement shows an explicit construction of transversal algorithms through diffeomorphisms. \n\n\nLet h M\u2192 N be a diffeomorphism. If W\u2282 N is a submanifold with codimension 1, then TTC(N;W)=TTC(M;h^-1(W)).\n\n\nLet Z=h^-1(W)\u2282 M. For U\u2282 N\u00d7 N and s U\u2192 N^[0,1] satisfying e_2^N\u2218 s=incl_U and s(x,y)\u22d4_s W whenever (x,y)\u2208 U, consider V=(h\u00d7 h)^-1(U)\u2282 M\u00d7 M, the map \u03c3 V\u2192 M^[0,1] given by \u03c3=(h^-1)_#\u2218 s\u2218(h\u00d7 h)_| V defines a local section of e_2^M, where (h^-1)_#:N^[0,1]\u2192 M^[0,1] is the induced map of h^-1, i.e., (h^-1)_#(\u03b1)=h^-1\u2218\u03b1. \n\nFor any (x,y)\u2208 V we will show that \u03c3(x,y)\u22d4_s Z. First, note that (h(x),h(y))\u2208 U and thus \u0393 = s(h(x),h(y)) is such that \u0393\u22d4_s W. Also, note that \u03c3(x,y)=h^-1\u2218\u0393 and \u03c3(x,y)(t)=h^-1(\u0393(t)) for any t\u2208 [0,1]. Suppose that \u03c3(x,y)(t_0)\u2208 Z for some t_0\u2208 (0,1), then \u0393(t_0)\u2208 W and so  \u0393(t) is smooth for t\u2208 (0,1), and \u0393'(t_0)\u2209 T_\u0393(t_0)W. Then \u03c3(x,y)(t) is smooth in t_0\u2208 (0,1) and \u03c3'(x,y)(t_0)=(d h^-1)_\u0393(t_0)(\u0393'(t_0))\u2209 T_\u03c3(x,y)(t_0)Z. Therefore, TTC(N;W)\u2265TTC(M;h^-1(W)).\n\nThe inequality TTC(M;h^-1(W))\u2265TTC(N;W) follows from the first part applying to h^-1 N\u2192 M with Z\u2282 M.\n\n\n\n    Consider the diffeomorphism h\u211d^2\u2192\u211d^2,\u00a0h(x,y)=(x,y-x^2), whose inverse f\u211d^2\u2192\u211d^2 is given by f(a,b)=(a,a^2+b). Set W={(a,b)\u2208\u211d^2:\u00a0b=0}, then Z=f(W)={(x,y)\u2208\u211d^2:\u00a0y=x^2} is the parabola. From Example\u00a0<ref>, we have that the map s\u211d^2\u00d7\u211d^2\u2192(\u211d^2)^[0,1] given by \n    s(C_1,C_2)(t)=\n            (1-2t)C_1+2te_2,   for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/2;\n    \n           (2-2t)e_2+(2t-1)C_2,   for 1/2\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n where e_2=(0,1), is a transversal continuous algorithm with respect to the submanifold W. Then, by Proposition\u00a0<ref>, the map \u03c3\u211d^2\u00d7\u211d^2\u2192(\u211d^2)^[0,1] given by, for B_1=(x_1,y_1) and B_2=(x_2,y_2): \n    \u03c3(B_1,B_2)(t)   =f(s(h(B_1),h(B_2))(t))\n       =\n            f((1-2t)h(B_1)+2te_2),   for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/2;\n    \n           f((2-2t)e_2+(2t-1)h(B_2)),   for 1/2\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n    \n       =\n            f((1-2t)(x_1,y_1-x_1^2)+2te_2),   for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/2;\n    \n           f((2-2t)e_2+(2t-1)(x_2,y_2-x_2^2)),   for 1/2\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n    \n       =\n            f((1-2t)x_1,(1-2t)(y_1-x_1^2)+2t),   for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/2;\n    \n           f((2t-1)x_2,(2-2t)+(2t-1)(y_2-x_2^2)),   for 1/2\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n    \n       =((1-2t)x_1,(1-2t)^2x_1^2+(1-2t)(y_1-x_1^2)+2t),   for 0\u2264 t\u2264 1/2;\n    ((2t-1)x_2,(2t-1)^2x_2^2+(2-2t)+(2t-1)(y_2-x_2^2)),   for 1/2\u2264 t\u2264 1;\n    ,\n defines a transversal algorithm in \u211d^2 with respect to the parabola Z.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nplain\n10\ncornea2003lusternik O.
