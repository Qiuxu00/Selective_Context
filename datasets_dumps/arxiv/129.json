In particular, game genres are of interest: No two experts seem to agree on what they are and how they relate to each other. We use the user-generated tags of the video game digital distribution service Steam to better understand how players think about games. We investigate what they consider to be genres, what comes first to their minds when describing a game, and more generally what words do they use and how those words relate to each other. Our method is data-driven as we consider for each game on Steam how many players assigned each tag to it. We introduce a new metric, the priority of a Steam tag, that we find interesting in itself. This allows us to create taxonomies and meronomies of some of the Steam tags. In particular, in addition to providing a list of game genres, we distinguish what tags are essential or not for describing games according to players. Furthermore, we provide a small group of tags that summarise all information contained in the Steam tags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\nIn the last two decades, game analytics has gained a lot of interest\u00a0<cit.>. According to Su, Backlund and Engstr\u00f6m, \u201cgame analytics is the process of identifying and communicating meaningful patterns that can be used for game decision making\u201d\u00a0<cit.>. They present a classification of game analytics into four groups: game development analytics, game publishing analytics, game distribution channel analytics and game player analytics. In this paper, we focus on game player analytics. Our aim is to understand the vocabulary used by players to speak about video games. More precisely, we are interested in how players describe games: what are the most important words, what are the most used words, and so on.\n\nIn our study, we rely exclusively on Steam tags: groups of words that players can freely assign to games. Some examples are Strategy, Card Battler, Agriculture, Ninja, Difficult and Free to Play. In total, there exist 427 Steam tags. For a more comprehensive explanation of Steam tags, please refer to Subsection\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 From beliefs to facts\n\nIn\u00a0<cit.>, Drachen et al. observe that game analytics \u201cis in its infancy and the available knowledge is heavily fragmented, not the least due to Game Analytics interdisciplinary nature and the lack of knowledge sharing between academia and industry\u201d. As industry researchers, the goal of our paper is to build bridges with academia. Drachen et al. add that \u201cthe root cause of these problems is the lack of a framework for organizing current knowledge and prioritising interesting problems\u201d\u00a0<cit.>. They introduce the concept of stylised facts for mobile game analytics (although we believe that the concept is essential to game analytics in general) in order to better connect industry and academia.\n\nHowever, they argue that the available knowledge and data are too fragmented and incomplete to establish stylised fact. Thus, they introduce two \u201cproto-stylised fact concepts which describe situations where less empirical validation is available: beliefs and hypothetical stylised facts\u201d\u00a0<cit.>. The aim is to \u201cprovide\na roadmap for structuring current knowledge and building towards a situation where stylised facts can be generated and validated\u201d. Beliefs are statements supported by virtually no empirical evidence, whereas hypothetical stylised facts are supported by some empirical evidence. However, they are still not stylised facts, since \u201cwhile there maybe some available empirical evidence supporting these hypothetical stylised facts, it is clearly not enough to rigorously, generally, support them\u201d. Establishing hypothetical stylised facts help in obtaining stylised fact, which is essential for the research field (see\u00a0<cit.> for a detailed argumentation).\n\nIn this paper, we provide empirical evidence for several hypothetical stylised facts. Some of which we introduce, while others were already beliefs in the industry, for instance that genre is one of the most crucial pieces of information when describing a video game. We aim at presenting our findings in a quantitative manner, and to provide an interpretation of the metrics we introduce.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Taxonomies and meronomies\n\n\nIn Section\u00a0<ref>, we present a data-driven taxonomy of all Steam tags. This consists in doing a hierarchical classification, where we divide the tags into categories and subcategories. Those are referred to as \u201ctaxa\u201d. Each tag is put into one of the taxa of lower rank, which are themselves grouped into taxa of higher rank. Our taxonomy has a tree-like structure, but others may be more network-like, with one child having several parents.\n\nWe also provide in Section\u00a0<ref> two data-driven meronomies of some Steam tags. A meronomy differs from a taxonomy as it deals with part-whole relationships, whereas a taxonomy is a classification of discrete elements. Using mathematical notation, a meronomy can be thought of as a partially ordered set where the elements are sets and the relation considered is inclusion (we have A \u2264 B if A is a subset of B). Here, our aim is to better understand how some tags relate to each other. Using a data-driven approach, we establish some relation between tags, for instance that 2D Platformer is a subtag of Platformer, and that Sailing is a subtag of Naval.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 A focus on game genres\n\n\nA part of our study concerns game genres. In particular, we are interested in finding a complete list of game genres, and to understand how much genre matters to players. Arsenault observes that many websites allow the user to search through video games while filtering by genre\u00a0<cit.>. However, no two websites seem to agree on what the list of genres is. For instance, he mentions GameSpot's system (at the time of his writing) that does a taxonomy of the genres: genres are subdivided into subgenres, thus creating 157 categories. He gives some examples:\n\n    \n  * Action \u2192 Shooter \u2192 First-Person \u2192 Fantasy,\n    \n  * Miscellaneous \u2192 Puzzle \u2192 Action,\n    \n  * Strategy \u2192 Real-Time \u2192 Fantasy.\n\n\nArsenault notes that \u201cwhile every category is unique and independent in principle, some of the lower-tiered\ndescriptors appear as sub-branches of multiple genres\u201d\u00a0<cit.>. He adds that \u201cthe levels or branches themselves are not named, which means there is no basis on which to compare them\u201d, and \u201ccomparing all 2nd-level classes would probably amount to comparing apples to oranges to shoes to faith\u201d. He concludes: \u201cOne thing that these different taxonomies highlight is the fluidity and impreciseness of the concept of genre itself, and how it is used in actually describing games\u201d. The same issues are noted by Heintz and Law\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n\n    \n  * Genres are not clearly or consistently defined,\n    \n  * The relation between genres is unknown,\n    \n  * Definitions are based on completely different aspects,\n    \n  * Different sources use different sets of genres.\n\n\n\n\nSteam provides a set of tools for developers and publishers named Steamworks. They provide a taxonomy of Steam tags\u00a0<cit.>. Tags are divided into several taxa: Genres, Visual Properties, Themes & Moods, Features, Players, Other Tags, Software, Assessments, Ratings etc, Hardware/Input and Funding etc. The taxon Genres, which is our main focus here, is split into three taxa: Super-Genre, Genre and Sub-Genre. This taxonomy is to be understood with the broad definition of a taxonomy, in which a child may have several parents. For instance, Heist is a sub-genre and also a theme. Flight is a sub-genre and also a feature. Experimental is a super-genre and a genre. One objective of this paper is to challenge Steam's taxonomy and investigate whether players concur with it.\n\nClassifying video games into genres is valuable for studying and comparing meaningful categories. For instance, in the literature we can find studies on what genres are the most successful\u00a0<cit.> (and also\u00a0<cit.> although the study is about board games instead of video games), how considering games from the same genre is important for deciding on a release date\u00a0<cit.>, how genre relates to players motivations, gender and localisation\u00a0<cit.>, or what are their usability profiles\u00a0<cit.>. All these studies use a list of genres, but do not discuss much (or not at all) whether it makes sense to discuss about genres, whether the list is comprehensive, and so on.\n\nA more industry-oriented reason for establishing a comprehensive list of game genres, along with definitions and relationships between the genres, comes from trailer making. Lieu, who was involved in the creation of the trailers of Half-Life: Alyx, Among Us and The Long Dark among others, asserts that a trailer of a video game must first clearly establish its genre\u00a0<cit.>. Therefore, it is crucial to have an exact understanding of what a genre is. Moreover, Lieu details what a trailer should show according to the game genre\u00a0<cit.>. Similarly, Carless, who is the founder of GameDiscoverCo, a video game discoverability consultancy firm, believes that game genre is \u201cwhat [their] users want to see information about\u201d. In a database meant for people working in the video game industry, Carless \u201ccare[s] most that the main genres are in Genre and are easy to see and sort\u201d ([Carless, personal communication]). \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The Steam tags\n\n\nIn this paper, we rely solely on Steam data. More precisely, we study the user-generated tags on Steam. There exists a total of 427 tags that players have assigned to the 50757 games in Steam. Those tags, consisting of groups of words or acronyms like Action RPG, MOBA or Open World, are freely assigned to games by players, who can also invent new ones. \n\nThere exist many papers relying on Steam data, for instance Steam players reviews\u00a0<cit.> or Steam user accounts\u00a0<cit.>. Some of these studies use Steam tags, but there are only used as tools for filtering games, and are not the topic of study. To the best of our knowledge, there are only three papers that truly study Steam tags per se. First, Windleharth et al. do in\u00a0<cit.> a conceptual analysis of Steam tags. They discuss and classify Steam tags into categories, some containing many elements like Gameplay genre, and some containing only one elements like Relationships which contains only the tag Remake. Windleharth et al. rely on their own expertise to determine what tags are genre tags. In this paper, we use a data-driven approach with the same goal in mind. A second paper that studies Steam tags is\u00a0<cit.>, in which Li and Zhang examine how genre tags are related to each other. Finally, in\u00a0<cit.>, Li uses correlation between Steam tags related to gameplay to obtain a list of 29 \u201cfactors\u201d. Those factors are not necessarily Steam tags but rather groups of highly correlated Steam tags. For instance, the factor Rogue contains the Steam tags Dungeon Crawler, Rogue-like and Rogue-lite. We compare our method to theirs in Section\u00a0<ref>, and argue why ours is more reliable. We also compare our results with theirs in Sections\u00a0<ref> and\u00a0<ref>.\n\nAll players are free to assign to games some of the already-existing Steam tags, or even to add new ones. For a game, Steam shows \u201ctags that were applied to the product by the most users\u201d. Steam shows at most 20 tags for any game, sorted by decreasing order of number of players who assigned the tag. The exact number of players who assigned a tag is not directly shown on Steam, but can be found in the source code of the page. To obtain the data of how many players assigned a tag to a game, we used SteamSpy's API. There are 13848 games with 20 tags shown on Steam, and therefore 50757-13848=36909 games with fewer than 20 tags. One can make the experience of adding a new tag to a game with fewer than 20 tags, and have the surprise of not having their newly added tag shown in Steam. The reason for that is that Steam only shows tags that were assigned by at least 5 players. Steam does not explicitly mention this, but we could check it by going over all games. Since anyone can add any set of nonsensical words as a tag, this is probably for the best.  \n\nIt is important to note that Steam does not offer a definition of the tags, one sufficient reason being that tags are freely added and invented by players (as can been seen in the inconsistent capitalisation and hyphenation of the tags). Therefore, players interpret by themselves the meanings of the tags. For our study, this comes with pros and cons. Since \u201cgenres are not clearly or consistently defined\u201d\u00a0<cit.>, we may, thanks to Steam tags, find consensuses about what a given genre is. We believe that there exists some common understanding of what, say, an adventure game is. By an equivalent of the law of large numbers, Steam tags can help decipher what the definition is. However, there are also cases when players are clearly referring to distinct things while using the same tag, which perturbs our analysis. One easily spotted example is the tag Football, which sometimes refers to soccer, and sometimes to American football. An another example is the tag Fighting. For some games, it seems that the tag is used to state the genre of the games, whereas in other games it may be used to merely inform that there is some fighting in the game. This motivates why some tags have several parents in Steamworks' taxonomy\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nSeveral of our results rely on computing the Pearson correlation coefficient between tags. We point out another difficulty we face, that stems from the nature of the database. One would expect some pairs of tags to have an extremely low correlation (around -1), for instance: 2D and 3D, First-Person and Third Person[We follow Steam spelling with a hyphen in First-Person but none in Third Person.], Singleplayer and Multiplayer, and so on. Indeed, a priori, a game is either in 2D or 3D, either has a first-person or third person viewpoint, and is either a singleplayer or a multiplayer game. To compute the correlation, we create a matrix with one entry per game, and one column per tag. There is a value of 1 if the tag is assigned to the corresponding game, and 0 otherwise. We compute a correlation of -0.17 for 2D and 3D, 0.04 for First-Person and Third Person, and 0.10 for Singleplayer and Multiplayer. We investigated what was the cause of these surprisingly high correlation coefficients. There are games that use 2.5D or isometric representations. Those are mixes of 2D and 3D features. We found that generally, whenever the tag 2.5D or Isometric is assigned to a game, the tags 2D and 3D are also (wrongly) assigned to the game by players. This is why the correlation is closer to 0 than to -1. Concerning the viewpoint, there are many shooter games using the third person view that change for a first-person view when the player is aiming. In those games, we found that both tags First-Person and Third Person are assigned. Similarly, if a game contains a singleplayer campaign and a multiplayer mode, then both tags Singleplayer and Multiplayer are usually assigned. In conclusion, one has to be very careful when exploiting pairs of tags with low correlation, since one might miss a few relevant pairs.\n\nSteam does not provide the information of how many players assigned tags to a given game. However, the number of players who assigned the most given tag of a game G gives us a lower bound on the number of players who assigned tags to G. Using this method, we know that there are at least 15843 games for which at least 100 players assigned some tags.\n\nWe said that Steam shows at most 20 tags for a game. This is not exactly true in the source code. Indeed, there are a few games, 235 to be exact, with 21 tags. They all share a common property: The 21st tag is VR Only, and is assigned by precisely one player. This is probably a feature added by Steam. We make the choice of removing this tag from the database, since it was not added by real players.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Our contributions\n\n\nIn Section\u00a0<ref> we present a new concept: the priority of a tag for a game. We show that this is a useful notion, for we establish as a hypothetical stylised fact that tags with the highest priority are what players think about first when describing the game (see Section\u00a0<ref> for a formal definition of priority and a formal statement of the hypothetical stylised fact). On the other hand, tags with low priority are what players deem interesting about the game, but which only come later to their minds. Using this concept of priority, we give empirical evidence in Section\u00a0<ref> for the following hypothetical stylised fact:\n\n\nGame genre is what players think about first when describing a game.\n\n\nConsequently, we believe that this is also what they want to hear about first when discovering a new game, confirming the soundness of Lieu's practices in trailer making\u00a0<cit.>. On a related note, using a data-driven approach we establish a list, as comprehensive as possible, of game genres. Our aim here is to encompass all words that players may consider as game genres. The list can be found in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\n\nWe provide in Section\u00a0<ref> a meronomy of the tags (not necessarily about genre) with broadest meanings. In particular, we find a set of seven tags with broadest meanings, that we name the \u201ccapital tags\u201d. There are four properties that we want the capital tags to satisfy. First, they should form a rather short list. As we have 7 capital tags out of the 427 Steam tags, this is clearly satisfied. Secondly, for any game, at least one of these tags should be assignable to the game. Thirdly, those tags should not be redundant. Finally, any other tag should be a more refined version of some of the capital tags. We show in Section\u00a0<ref> that the capital tags satisfy this three last properties. This implies that the capital tags summarise all information contained in Steam tags.\n\nWe provide a second meronomy in Section\u00a0<ref>, that aims at reducing the number of Steam tags without loosing information, by merging synonymous tags together. We propose a method for doing so as well as finding a representing tag for each group of merged tags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE PRIORITY OF STEAM TAGS\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0<cit.>, Li and Zhang defines a graph that aims to accurately represent the Steam tags. There is one vertex per tag, and two tags are connected by an edge if they are both assigned to a same game. The edges are weighted according to how many games have both tags assigned to them. The authors discard some edges by using the \u201cNarrow by tag\u201d feature in Steam. We find the authors' results difficult to interpret due to their chosen methodology. First, it is not clear what the Steam \u201cNarrow by tag\u201d feature does. Additionally, the authors connect two tags T and T' with an edge even if for the game G to which they are both assigned, the tag T is the most assigned tag to G and T' is the least assigned tag to G, without discussing the rationale behind this decision. It seems wrong to us to connect the two tags with an edge since T is apparently essential for describing G whereas T' is not so much relevant.\n\nIn\u00a0<cit.>, Li computes correlation between tags. The analysis is more precise than in\u00a0<cit.> since when a tag T is assigned to a game, a weight is associated to T. If for a given game G, the tag T is the tag most assigned to G, then T obtains a weight of 20. If G has 20 tags and T is the least assigned, it obtains a weight of 1. More generally, the n-th most assigned tag obtains a weight of 20-n+1. We point out two issues. First, Li does not discuss whether it makes sense to use these weights, and how to interpret them. Secondly, the distributions of the number of players who assigned tag varies greatly over all games. For instance, the two most assigned tags to the game HITMAN 2 are Stealth (10373 players) and Assassin (819 players). The ratios of the number of players for these tags is therefore 819/10373\u2248 0.08. If we do the same with the same with the game Golf It!, we find that the most assigned tag is Multiplayer (249 players) and the second most assigned is Mini Golf (243 players). This time, the ratio is 243/249\u2248 0.98. With Li's method, those ratios would be 19/20 = 0.95 for both games\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nIn this section, we define, interpret and study a new metric, that will be used in all later sections for the taxonomies and meronomies. It is a more refined version of what was proposed by Li\u00a0<cit.>. For each Steam tag, we define what we call its priority for a given game.\n\n\n\nThe priority of a tag T for a given game G is a score that ranges from 0 to 1. Let t_T denote the number of players who assigned to the game G the tag T. Similarly, let t_max denote the maximum over all tags assigned to G of the number of players who assigned the tag. The priority of T for G is equal to t_T/t_max. A fictional example is shown in Table\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\nIn particular, any game with at least one tag has a tag with priority 1: the tag that was assigned to it by the largest number of players. If a tag was not among the 20 most assigned tags to a given game, then its priority is 0 (recall that Steam only shows the 20 most assigned tags). We choose this metric as we are interested in identifying how players think about games. Let us consider all positive priorities over all games and tags. We compute a mean of 0.60, a median of 0.61 and a standard deviation of 0.28. This shows that the priority contains some information, as the standard deviation is quite high. There are two compatible reasons as to why not all tags have the same priority for a given game G. First, it may be that some players assign much fewer tags than other players. This would imply that the tags with highest priority correspond to what players think about first when describing G. The second reason would be that players do not perfectly agree on what tags are best suited to describe G. This second reason would imply that the tags with highest priority are what players agree upon for describing G, and that their opinions diverge on the tags with low (but non-zero) priority. We argue that the first reason is the most important, and present the following hypothetical stylised fact:\n\n\nFor a given game G, the tags with highest priority correspond to what players think about first when describing\u00a0G.\n\n\nWe provide empirical evidence supporting Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>. The fact is hypothetical as defined in\u00a0<cit.> because our methods for supporting it cannot establish it for good. This could be done if we had access to a database of the tags assignment per player, but this is not publicly available.\n\n\n\n\nWe consider two tags: Shooter and FPS. \u201cFPS\u201d stands for \u201cfirst-person shooter\u201d, and is a subgenre of shooter game\u00a0<cit.>. Therefore, anyone who thinks that a given game G is an FPS would also agree that it is a shooter game. We consider all of the 1867 games to which both tags Shooter and FPS are assigned, with FPS having the highest number of players. If Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref> were wrong, for each game we should have very similar priorities for both tags. Indeed all players who assigned the tag FPS would also assign the tag Shooter. In contrast, we believe that some players assign only a few tags, corresponding to what comes first to their mind. Under this hypothesis, we would expect some players to only assign the tag FPS, but not the tag Shooter as it is less important to them, or because they consider it to be already implied by the tag FPS. The histogram in Figure\u00a0<ref> illustrates the ratios between the priority of FPS and Shooter. We observe a long tail phenomenon; also the mean is equal to 0.76 and the median to 0.83. This implies that for half of the considered games, less than 83% of those players who assigned the tag FPS also assigned the tag Shooter.\n\nWe apply the same method for the tags Online Co-Op and Co-op\u00a0[Steam tags are case sensitive. We follow the Steam capitalisation which may differ from tag to tag.]. Obviously, a game with an online co-op mode thereby contains a co-op mode. However, when we consider the 1171 games to which both tags Online Co-Op and Co-op are assigned, with Online Co-Op having the highest number of players, we observe again a long tail phenomenon in Figure\u00a0<ref>. The mean is equal to 0.73 and the median 0.80. The natural explanation to this long tail phenomenon and to these low means and medians is Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>: Many players only assign a few tags to a game, the ones that come first to their mind. We have shown here the results for only two pairs of tags, for which the numbers of corresponding games were important (1867 and 1171, respectively). We tested other pairs, and for all of them we obtained similar results, but due to lack of space we do not show them here. Also, the number of games was significantly lower. Some examples of those pairs are Top-Down Shooter and Top-Down (655 games), Football and Sports (165 games), Traditional Roguelike and Rogue-like\u00a0[Once again we follow the spelling of Steam, where rogue-like is not always written with a hyphen.] (102 games).\n\n\n\nIn Figure\u00a0<ref>, we observed histograms with a peak around a priority of 0.9 and a long tail. Recall that we were considering pairs of tags where the first tag implies the second. We argued that causality was not perfectly reflected in the tag distributions, because of the long tail phenomenon. However, the position of the peak still indicates that there is a high correlation. As a comparison, let us do the same for two tags which are a priori not correlated. In Figure\u00a0<ref>, we applied the same method as before on the tags RPG and Multiplayer. Those are intuitively not correlated since there are multiplayer RPGs (for instance MMORPGs), but also many singleplayer RPGs. We observe that the histogram is rather constant; there is no strong peak around 1. This is a first hint that useful information might be contained in the correlation between tag priorities. We use this idea of considering the correlation for our meronomies in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\nWe point out an issue that we discovered concerning the priority. Although we still believe the notion to be of interest, and that it brings useful information, we think that the notion could be refined and improved in future work. It seems that for some reason unknown to us, the priority of some tags behave erratically. Let us consider for instance the tag Free to Play. We consider three free to play games: Dota 2, Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. For the first two games, Free to Play has a priority of 1. However, the second tag with highest priority for Dota 2 is MOBA with a priority of 0.33, whereas for Team Fortress 2 it is Hero Shooter with a priority of 0.99. It is quite intriguing to us how the priorities of the second tags with highest priorities can be so different. This phenomenon occur regularly with the tag Free to Play. We do not understand why the priority of the second most assigned tag can differ so much, when both games are equally free to play. We fear that for Dota 2, the tag Free to Play pushes all other priorities to very low values, thereby introducing noise in the data. Concerning Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the priority of Free to Play is 0. The reason for this can be easily understood: The game was released in 2012 and made free to play only in 2018. We believe that the tags were mostly assigned soon after the release of the game, and that is why Free to Play is not amongst the 20 most assigned tags. This motivates even further the fact that the method should be refined, with a particular emphasis on the tag Free to Play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 A TAXONOMY OF STEAM TAGS\n\n\n\nIn this section, we categorise all of the Steam tags through a taxonomy. In Section\u00a0<ref>, we defined the notion of priority of a tag for a game, and established that it contained some information. In particular, we gave empirical evidence for Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>, stating that for a given game G, tags with high priorities correspond to what players think about first when describing G. In this section, we consider tags one by one, and for each tag we look at its priority distribution over all games for which the priority is non-zero. This allows us to define the taxa of higher rank into which we classify the Steam tags.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The taxa of higher rank\n\n\n\n\nAt the highest level, we have three taxa: High priority tags, Medium priority tags and Low priority tags. Let us start with the taxon Low priority tags.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Low priority tags\n\n\nAccording to Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>, those tags correspond to what few players deem interesting for describing a game, and that is not what they think about first. We define this taxon as the set of tags whose priority median is at most 0.45. There are 80 tags in this taxon. We chose this threshold using our own expertise of the video game industry. Tags with higher priority medians seem to us to come significantly faster in players' minds when describing a game.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe present in Table\u00a0<ref> the tags with the lowest priority median, along with the number of games to which they are assigned. One could argue that we do not have enough data to deal with tags that are assigned to very few games. However, for the taxon of Low priority tags, we think that if a tag was seldomly assigned, it supports even more the claim that this tag is not what players think about first when describing a game. Nonetheless, among the Low priority tags, there are some that are assigned to thousands of games. We show them in Table\u00a0<ref>. We find those tags especially interesting. Players do not use those tags as their primary descriptors for a game, yet they are still assigned to many games. This gives us an interesting learning: Having a low priority does not mean that the tag is not important. Indeed, it is important for players to know whether a game has singleplayer or multiplayer modes. It is just not what is the most essential to describe a game. In Subsection\u00a0<ref>, we delve deeper into the tags Singleplayer and Multiplayer.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 High priority tags\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore defining the taxon of High priority tags, let us first consider priority histograms of tags that clearly should be in that taxon. Three are depicted in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We observe that these histograms roughly look like Dirac functions centred at 1. We want to define our High priority tags taxon as the set of tags whose histograms look similarly to those three. To allow for some wiggle room, we decided to define the taxon as the set of tags whose priority median is sufficiently high, at least 0.574803, and whose maximum value in the histogram is obtained for a priority of at least 0.765644. Both thresholds were decided using our own expertise of video games. The median threshold was chosen so that the tag Twin Stick Shooter would be in that taxon, as its priority median is exactly that value, but not Underground and Conversation that were following. The maximum value threshold was chosen such that Tabletop would be a High priority tag, but not 2.5D and Lore-Rich that were following. With this definition, we have 155 High priority tags. By looking at these tags, it seems that nearly all of them are about genre. We discuss this in further detail in Subsection\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Medium priority tags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have one last taxon of higher rank for all of the remaining 192 tags. When looking at the histograms, we distinguish three types of shapes. Figure\u00a0<ref> depicts them. We have curves that look like Gaussian curves, as with 2D, curves that look rather constant, like the one of Open World, and curves with two peaks, like the one of PvE. However, it seems that these types of shapes do not procure any insightful meaning. Indeed, one can see in Figure\u00a0<ref> three histograms of other Medium priority tags. Observe that they are all similar to the one of 2D. However, we do not see any similarity between 2D, 1990's, Military and Robots beyond the fact that they are Medium priority tags. It seems to us that in this case, the shape of the histogram does not bring us any further insight.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The taxa of lower rank\n\n\n\nIn this subsection, we divide taxa of higher rank into several taxa. Our most interesting comments concerns High priority tags, thus we focus on their study.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The taxon of High priority tags\n\n\n\nInterestingly, all High priority tags related to gameplay are genre names: Adventure, RPG, Farming Sim and so on. Furthermore, nearly all tags commonly understood as genre tags are in the High priority tags taxon. We consider this finding to be one of the main contributions of this paper. We can now define \u201cgenre tags\u201d as \u201cgameplay related tags with high priority\u201d. Also, it provides empirical evidence for Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>: Genre is indeed what players think about first when describing a game.\n\nSome tags are assigned to fewer than 100 games. We believe that this is too few games for qualifying those tags as \u201cgenres\u201d. We create a taxon for those tags that have high priority median, but that are assigned to too few games. Those are: BMX, Cycling, Motocross, Skateboarding, Tennis, Baseball, Lemmings, Wrestling, Mini Golf, Social Deduction, Warhammer 40K, Roguevania, Medical Sim, LEGO, Outbreak Sim, Pinball, Spelling, Golf, Jet and Action RTS. \n\nSteam products are not limited to video games, strictly defined. Other products are also available, and their corresponding tags are all in the High priority tags taxon. This is unsurprising, as if these products were deemed to be games, then the following High priority tags would undoubtedly qualify as game genres: Utilities, Audio Production, Video Production, Animation & Modeling, Design & Illustration, Photo Editing, Software Training and Web Publishing. On a related note, we also have the tags Game Development and Programming which are more about making than playing video games. Those tags we put on a separate taxon. In Subsection\u00a0<ref>, we provide further evidence to support our decision to treat those tags as an independent taxon.\n\nIn total, we divide the taxon of High priority games into four taxa: game genres (which are gameplay related tags), tags assigned to too few games, tags related to products that are not video games, and the miscellaneous tags. In this last taxon we find: Free to Play, Indie, Early Access, Massively Multiplayer, e-sports, Sexual Content, Nudity, LGBTQ+, Dinosaurs, Mechs, Cats, Experimental, Noir, Lovecraftian and Western. \n\nWe list the learnings we obtain from these tags being High priority tags. Unsurprisingly, players care about whether the game is free. We indeed expect players to mind how much they have to pay for a game, which is why Free to Play is a High priority tag. Secondly, the tags Indie, Early Access, Massively Multiplayer and e-sports provide a lot of information about the type of game, even though those are not genres. Players know better how much money was invested into the game, whether the game is entirely finished, whether it involves a lot of interactions with other players, and whether it is made for e-sports. This tag in itself is full of information. It implies that the game is hard to master, that it has a multiplayer mode, and that it is competitive. The presence of the tags Sexual Content and Nudity is also not surprising, as they can be important filters for players to know whether they want to play a game. Next, we have the tags LGBTQ+, Dinosaurs, Mechs and Cats[Interestingly, players are more interested in cats than in dogs. Indeed Cats has a median priority of 0.60 with a maximum value in the histogram at 0.96, whereas for the tag Dog those values are 0.56 and 0.45, respectively.] which are themes that players think to be so important that they are worth mentioning right away when describing a game. Similarly, Experimental, Noir, Lovecraftian and Western are ambiances of high importance for players when describing a game. We believe that game developers can benefit from knowing that these themes and ambiances matter particularly to players. \n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The taxon of Medium priority tags\n\n\nAs we said, our most interesting comments are for High priority tags. In particular, we showed in Figure\u00a0<ref> that the priority histogram was not sufficient for classifying the Medium priority tags into meaningful taxa. Thus, for the rest of the section, we only discuss why a few tags widely regarded as genres were put into the Medium priority tags taxon. Those tags are: FPS, Shooter, Fighting, Stealth, Hack and Slash, Survival, Survival Horror, Horror, MOBA, 4X, RTS, Grand Strategy, Trading Card Game, Match 3, Hidden Object and MMORPG. We still believe that those tags should be considered as genre, and explain why they were misclassified. Concerning FPS, Shooter, Fighting, Stealth, Hack and Slash, Survival, Survival Horror and Horror, they have relatively low priority medians because they are often used by players to say that some elements from these genres appear in a game. For instance, if it is possible to fight in a game, then the tag Fighting will surely appear with medium priority. Fighting is not the genre of the game, but it corresponds here to a gameplay element. Let us take another example with FPS and Shooter. The most assigned tags to the game Fallout 4 are Open World, Post-apocalyptic, Exploration and RPG. In our opinion, those tags indeed describe well this game. With a lower priority, we find also the tags Shooter and FPS. It is true that there are FPS elements in the game, which occur for instance when the player is aiming, therefore it is understandable that the tag appears with a medium priority. The takeaway is that tags may have different purposes and connotations. There are tags that might be used as genres, but also sometimes used to merely describe some gameplay elements. If it were a common practice to distinguish the two things and have a tag FPS - genre and a tag FPS - gameplay, we believe that the former would be put into the High priority tags taxon while the latter would be rightly classified as a Medium priority tag. It was most surprising to us to discover that MOBA is in that taxon. We expected it to only appear as a High priority tag. However, its priority median is quite low, with a value of 0.48, making it even closer to Low priority tags than High priority tags. After investigation, it appears that the tag is often assigned with a medium priority to team-based multiplayer games, even when they do not belong to the MOBA genre. It seems that players and the industry have a different understanding of the tag.\n\nConcerning the remaining tags, 4X, RTS, Grand Strategy, Trading Card Game, Match 3, Hidden Object and MMORPG, they seem to be overshadowed by other tags preferred by players. For instance 4X, RTS and Grand Strategy are overshadowed by Strategy, Turn-Based and Real-Time. Trading Card Game often appears after Card Game and Card Battler. Match 3 and Hidden Object are overshadowed by Puzzle. Likewise, MMORPG is regularly chosen only after RPG, Multiplayer and Massively Multiplayer. This is why, although they have a high priority median, their occurrence peak in the histogram is not close to a priority value of 1.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 List of genres comparison\n\n\nUsing our data-driven approach, we have now obtained a list of genre tags. It can be found in Appendix\u00a0<ref>. Those are mainly in the High priority taxon, and we presented in Paragraph\u00a0<ref> a list of tags that should still be considered as genre tags, although they were classed as Medium priority tags. We compare our list to Li's\u00a0<cit.> and to the one in Steamworks\u00a0<cit.> as they are both made from Steam tags. It would be interesting to compare ours to all genre lists. However, for the sake of brevity, we concentrate solely on those two lists.\n\nLi's list, although also being made from a data-driven approach, serves a different role than ours\u00a0<cit.>. His aim was to extract from Steam tags a reasonably small list of genre tags that would allow one to characterise all games, whereas our goal is to find an extensive list of genres. Consequently, Li's list contains 29 genres, and ours contains 127 tags. Still, the comparison is interesting as there are a few tags which are in Li's list but not in ours. Those are: Soccer, Resource Management, Music and Classic. For each genre, Li associates a group of correlated gameplay tags. Concerning Soccer, the group contains Soccer, Football and Sports. This choice seems strange to us, for then according to Li's list all sports game would be considered as soccer games. In our genre list, we have the tag Sports instead of Soccer, which seems more reasonable. The same happens with Resource Management that we would replace by Management and Music that we would replace by Rhythm. Concerning Classic in Li's list, its presence follows from the fact that Li considers Classic and Cult Classic to be related to gameplay. We disagree with that statement, although we cannot substantiate our belief with data.\n\nSimilar to ours, Steamworks' list of genre tags strives for comprehensiveness\u00a0<cit.>. Our list contains 127 tags whereas theirs contains 140. The two lists share 112 tags in common, which indicates that they mostly agree with each other. Let us start with the 15 tags that are in our list but not in Steamworks'. It is worth noting that despite Steamworks appearing to have all of the Steam tags (whether genre-related or not), some tags are actually absent. The genre tags in our list that do not even appear on Steamworks are: Cooking, Creature Collector, Party Game, Puzzle-Platformer and Roguelike Deckbuilder. More interestingly, there are a few tags that are High priority tags related to gameplay (which we thus consider as genre tags), which are not considered as genre tags by Steamworks. We provide the list here: Archery, Automation, Boxing, Deckbuilding, Fishing, Hunting, Naval Combat, Vehicular Combat, Otome and Parkour. All those tags were classed as Features in Steamworks instead of genres, except for Otome and Parkour which are classed as Themes & Moods. We think that the fact that those are High priority tags supports the idea of considering them as genre tags.\n\nWe present the 28 tags that are in Steamworks' list of genre tags but not in ours. Some are High priority tags about gameplay that we removed in Paragraph\u00a0<ref> because they were assigned to fewer than 100 games. Indeed, it seems to us that tags assigned to too few games cannot really define a genre. Those tags are: BMX, Baseball, Cycling, Golf, Medical Sim, Mini Golf, Motocross, Outbreak Sim, Roguevania, Pinball, Skateboarding, Spelling, Tennis and Wrestling. There are also a few High priority tags that we did not put into our list of genre tags because we deem that they are not clearly enough related to gameplay. Those are Programming, e-sports and Experimental. The remaining tags are all Medium priority tags, and are therefore not part of our genre lists. Our findings indicate that those are not words that first come to players mind when describing a game, and supports the idea of not considering them as genres. The tags are: Basketball, Bowling, Football, Hacking, Hockey, Open World, Skating, Skiing, Snowboarding, Soccer and Investigation.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 TWO MERONOMIES OF STEAM TAGS\n\n\n\nIn this section, we propose two meronomies of some Steam tags. In Section\u00a0<ref>, we classified the tags into taxa, where two tags in the same taxa share some properties (related to their priority distributions). In Section\u00a0<ref>, we use totally different methodologies, for different goals. In the resulting meronomies, we say that a tag A is a part of a broader tag B, or equivalently that A is a meronym of B.\n\nThe first meronomy we present focuses on the tags with the broadest meanings. We aim at finding the most general tags, and to see how they relate to each other. In particular, we focus on the tags at the top of the meronomy, the ones that are parts of no others, but all others tags are parts of them. We name them the \u201ccapital tags\u201d. We claim that the capital tags are interesting because they form the smallest set of words that one needs to describe all video games (without going into detail). \n\nThe second meronomy aims at finding synonymous tags. We believe that one can reduce the number of Steam tags without loosing too much information, as many tags share similar meanings. Our aim is to find those groups of tags, and for each one to find one representative.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The method\n\n\n\nThe method starts the same for both meronomies. The idea is to look at pairs of tags A and B that are correlated enough, and then check whether A or B appears more often. If B appears more often, we declare that A is a meronym of B. Intuitively, A should indeed be a part of B, as they are correlated and B appears more often, ergo has a broader meaning.\n\nFor each game G, we have an entry with 427 values (the number of Steam tags), where the value is the priority of the corresponding tag for the game G. As there are at most 20 tags with positive priority for any given game, it implies that at least 407 values are equal to 0. We compute the Pearson correlation coefficient for all pairs of tags. A natural idea would be to take all pairs with correlation above some threshold and be done with it. The issue is that many tags are assigned to very few games. Thus, their priority is 0 for virtually all games. This induces a bias, and two of such tags will have a strong correlation even though they are hardly related. To tackle this issue, we consider all pairs of tags A and B with correlation above 0.1, and then compute what we call their local Pearson correlation coefficient. It is equal to the Pearson correlation coefficient, but it is computed only on games to which at least one of A or B is assigned. \n\nFor the first meronomy, we keep only the pairs with local Pearson correlation coefficient above -0.7, over all pairs with (global) Pearson correlation above 0.1. For the second meronomy, we take all pairs with local Pearson coefficient above -0.6, while keeping a global Pearson correlation threshold of 0.1. Let us motivate the choice of these thresholds. For the global threshold, the lower it is, the better for the soundness of the results. However, getting it lower increases a lot the number of pairs of tags for which we have to compute the local Pearson correlation. As we have 428 tags, there are 4282=91378 pairs to consider. This is computationally quite expensive, which is why we only consider pairs with correlation above 0.1. There are 2197 of those pairs. As mentioned earlier, we have concerns with the global correlation approach in that it may produce some false positives (pairs with high correlation that are not closely related). However, we do not anticipate the occurrence of a false negative, that is a pair of tags with similar meanings but low correlation.\n\nFor the local threshold of the first meronomy, the value -0.7 may seem extremely low. However, as we do the computation only on the games to which at least one of the tags is assigned, this diminishes drastically the correlation value. Indeed, there are proportionally much more games to which only one tag is assigned, since we removed all games to which none are assigned. Thus, with a local threshold of -0.7, we are actually considering only 652 pairs of tags out of the 2196 that have global correlation above 0.1. Getting the threshold even lower would make us consider pairs that are actually not so much related, according to our own video game expertise. We present the result in Subsection\u00a0<ref>.\n\nWe study what happens when we set the local threshold to -0.6 in Subsection\u00a0<ref>. There are only 361 pairs with local correlation above this threshold. The choice of the value was again made using our own video game expertise. We chose the lowest value such that the pairs were indeed synonymous in our opinion.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The capital tags\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have a list of 652 pairs of tags with high correlation, we compute for each pair A, B whether A or B appears more. We construct an oriented graph with the tags as vertices and an edge from tag A to tag B if B occurs more often than A. This graph is unreadable as there are too many vertices and edges. However, we are mainly interested in the vertices that have the most incoming edges, as they correspond to tags with the broadest meanings. Figure\u00a0<ref> shows the subgraph induced by the vertices V with at least 9 incoming edges (that is the subgraph where the vertex set is V, and we show only edges between vertices in V). We observe that there are seven vertices with no outgoing edges, that we name the capital tags. One might observe that the graph shown in Figure\u00a0<ref> does not perfectly correspond to a meronomy. We tackle this issue at the end of the subsection, as we want first to focus on the capital tags.\n\nThe seven capital tags are Multiplayer, Singleplayer, Action, Casual, Adventure, Strategy and Anime. They correspond to tags that are correlated with a lot of other tags, and that occur more than them.\n\n\nThe name is a reference to the seven capital sins from Christian teachings. Thomas Aquinas uses the word \u201ccapital\u201d for the following reason: Accordingly a capital vice is so called, in the first place, from \u201chead\u201d taken in the proper sense, and thus the name \u201ccapital\u201d is given to a sin for which capital punishment is inflicted. It is not in this sense that we are now speaking of capital sins, but in another sense, in which the term \u201ccapital\u201d is derived from head, taken metaphorically for a principle or director of others. In this way a capital vice is one from which other vices arise, chiefly by being their final cause\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nWe posit that a similar phenomenon exists with tags, where the capital tags serve as the directors of the other Steam tags, much like how the capital vices act as the head of other vices. The seven capital tags encompass all others, as stated in the following hypothetical stylised fact:\n\n\nAll tags are parts of the capital tags.\n\n\nBy construction, our seven capital tags are tags that are correlated with a lot of other tags, and that occur more often than them. This is already some justification for Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>. We add some more evidence at the end of the subsection when we define a meronomy of the tags in Figure\u00a0<ref>. Before that, we state and establish another hypothetical stylised fact. First, we need to define the following concept:\n\nWe say that a game G is covered by a set of tags\u00a0\ud835\udcaf if at least one of the tags in \ud835\udcaf is assigned to\u00a0G.\n\n\n\nThe capital tags form a very small group of tags such that nearly all games are covered by this set.\n\n\nHypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>, although being quantitative in essence, is not perfectly mathematically defined. One reason for this is that the Steam tag are assigned by players. So all rules and observations should suffer from a few counterexamples, as the data is significantly noisy. On another note, it is computationally too hard to check Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>. If one wanted to check all sets of seven tags for instance, that would be 4287\u22484.97 \u00b7 10^14 sets of tags to test.\n\n\n\nOne can see in Table\u00a0<ref> that our choice of capital tags does cover nearly all games. We show the percentage of games covered by each of the capital tag. We also show the percentage for the set consisting of the tag of the line and all the ones above. The tags are sorted by decreasing percentage of games covered. We also do the same when considering only games with 20 tags. Games with fewer tags can be misleading, as it may simply be that not enough players assigned tags, and if more players did, then surely some of them would have assigned a capital tag. We observe that Table\u00a0<ref> strongly supports Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>.\n\nAs argued, it is not computationally possible to test all sets of seven games. Still, we present another set that could have been a fitting candidate: 2D, 3D, 2.5D, Isometric, Third Person, First-Person and Top-Down. All games are either in 2D, in 3D, or in some mix of the two: 2.5D or isometric. We even add Third Person and First-Person which imply that the game is in 3D, but give more information about the representation. The same holds with Top-Down and 2D. Therefore, one might expect to cover all games with these seven tags. This is not the case, as only 47% of the games are covered, and only 85% of the games with 20 tags are covered. This again supports Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>, as it substantiates the claim that the capital tags are very few while covering essentially all games.\n\nFor the sake of curiosity, we extended the capital tags with as few tags as possible in order to cover even more games. This was done by hand by looking at which games were not covered yet, and finding what tags were assigned to most of them. By adding the tags Arcade, RPG, Simulation, Survival, Puzzle and Horror to the capital tags, we cover 96.73% percent of games, and 99.78% percent of games with 20 tags. Unsurprisingly, several of those new tags can be found in Figure\u00a0<ref>: Puzzle, RPG and Simulation.\n\nWe make a few side-remarks that we deem interesting. First, we observe that for six of the capital tags, the percentage of games covered is less than the one of games with 20 tags covered. The only one for which it decreases is Casual, which goes from 43% to 42%. Moreover, the increase for the six others is quite different from tag to tag. The biggest increase in terms of scale factor happens with Multiplayer (scale factor of 1.69). Intuitively, the games with 20 tags are the most mainstream. This supports the idea that mainstream games on Steam more often offer multiplayer modes, and that they tend to be less casual. We also note that the second biggest increase is with Singleplayer (scale factor of 1.46). This tells us that even though Multiplayer and Singleplayer are classified in the Low Priority taxon (see Subsection\u00a0<ref>), they are actually assigned to many games, and would perhaps be assigned to all games if all games had 20 tags assigned to them. Therefore, low priority tags should not be thought of as of less importance. They are not what players think about first when describing a game, but may still be a feature that should be mentioned at a later step.\n\nRecall that a meronomy deals with part-whole relationships. Mathematically, a meronomy can be seen as a partially ordered set (poset). A partial order, denoted by \u2264, must satisfy three properties:\n\n\n    \n  * Transitivity: if A\u2264 B and B\u2264 C then A\u2264 C,\n    \n  * Reflexivity: we have A \u2264 A,\n    \n  * Antisymmetry: if A\u2264 B and B\u2264 A, then A=B.\n\n\nWe can see in Figure\u00a0<ref> that the relation depicted is not perfectly a partial order. Indeed, let us say that A is a part of B, denoted by A\u2264 B, if there is an arrow from A to B. The graph in Figure\u00a0<ref> looks a lot like a Hasse diagram. A Hasse diagram of a poset \u2264 is a representation where there is an edge from A to B if A\u2264 B and there is no C such that A\u2264 C \u2264 B. This is a useful and concise way of representing posets. For the graph in Figure\u00a0<ref> to be a Hasse diagram, one simply has to remove the edges from Puzzle, Atmospheric, Story Rich and Fantasy to Singleplayer. Thus, we are implying that we consider Sports to be a part of Simulation, which itself is a part of Strategy. Likewise, we say that Fantasy is a part of RPG, which itself is a part of Adventure.\n\nLet us mention some other relationships, not depicted in Figure\u00a0<ref>, but that are present in the larger graph (which we did not represent as there are too many edges to be readable). We have arrows from Co-op to Multiplayer and Action. There is an arrow from Cute to Colorful, itself being connected to 2D and Casual. Management is connected to Singleplayer and Simulation. Finally, we want to mention PvP being connected to Multiplayer. As all these relations are quite sensible, this supports our idea of looking at that graph as the Hasse diagram of some poset, or equivalently to establish a meronomy of those tags.\n\nWe now have evidence for Hypothetical Stylised Fact\u00a0<ref>: All tags are parts of the capital tags. By only adding or removing a few edges, we have obtained a meronomy for the tags of Figure\u00a0<ref> that could be extended further to the other tags. In this meronomy, we have seen that the capital tags are the ones at the top: All other tags are meronyms of the capital tags.\n\nFinally, we make a concluding remark about the capital tags. Four of them are game genres: Action, Adventure, Strategy and Casual (although it is debatable whether it is a genre, this is how it is considered in Steamworks' and our genre list\u00a0<cit.>). Two other tags give important information about the game, even though they are not genres: Singleplayer and Multiplayer. We suspect that the remaining tag, Anime, is actually an error. First, it is the tag among the capital tags that covers the smallest number of games. Secondly, the 11 tags that have an edge directed to it in the graph are: JRPG, Visual Novel, Otome, Dating Sim, Romance, Female Protagonist, Sexual Content, NSFW, Hentai, Nudity and Mature. We observe that the five latter tags refer to sexual content, and share a similar meaning. This might induce a bias, giving to much weight to tags related to sexual content, therefore wrongly putting Anime as a tag with many incoming edges in the graph.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The synonymous tags\n\n\n\nAs detailed in Subsection\u00a0<ref>, we now use a local correlation threshold of -0.6. We deem the pairs of tags that have a local correlation that high to be synonymous. In Subsection\u00a0<ref>, all edges were oriented from a tag to another: there was an arrow from A to B if B appears much more often than A. In this subsection, we are also interested in knowing when tags appear mostly together. Indeed, this would be the best examples of tags being synonymous. When tags appear mostly together, we draw a  mutual edge: an arrow that points towards both ends. To decide what kind of edge to draw, we do the following: For the tags A and B, we compute X_A, X_B, X_A\u222a B and X_A\u2229 B which denote how many times A was assigned to a game but not B, how many times B was assigned to a game but not A, how many times at least one of A or B was assigned, and how many times both were assigned, respectively. We define r_A:=X_A/X_A\u222a B, r_B:=X_B/X_A\u222a B and r_A\u2229 B:=X_A\u2229 B/X_A\u222a B. If the maximum of these three ratios is r_A, then we draw an arrow from B to A. If it is r_B, then we draw an arrow from A to B. If it is r_A\u2229 B, then we draw a mutual arrow between A and B.\n\nBefore running the program on the tags, we remove a few of them. The reason for this is that there are tags which are correlated with a lot of other tags, and that are assigned to many games. Those are the ones we mentioned in Subsection\u00a0<ref>. We remove the capital tags in addition to 2D, Shooter, Puzzle, Atmospheric, Simulation, Story Rich and Fantasy (which are amongst the other tags with the highest number of edges oriented towards them in Figure\u00a0<ref>). Keeping those tags would distort the result and show only correlation between those tags and few others.\n\nAlso, we use the information we obtained in Subsection\u00a0<ref>. Recall that we classified the tags into three taxa of higher rank: High priority tags, Medium priority tags and Low priority tags. In the oriented graph of this subsection, we draw dotted red arrows for edges where the two involved tags are not from the same taxon. Indeed, not being in the same taxon may be a hint that these tags are not synonymous after all, since they are not used in the same way by players, although being highly correlated.\n\n\n\nSome synonymous tags are shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. Due to lack of space, we only depict the examples we find most meaningful. As a first simple example, we have an edge from Crowdfunded to Kickstarter. As wanted, the meanings of those two tags are very close. Let us consider the subgraph induced by Naval Combat, Naval and Sailing. The arrow from Sailing to Naval is natural, as the meanings are close and Sailing implies Naval. However, Naval Combat and Naval are not so much synonymous. Indeed, one is understood as a game genre, whereas the other merely indicates that a game involves ships. This is why the information from Subsection\u00a0<ref>, depicted by the dotted red arrow, does matter. Although it is inevitable that Naval Combat and Naval be correlated, it seems wrong to treat them as synonyms. Likewise, the arrow from Turn-Based to Turn-Based Strategy is treacherous, as one is a gameplay element, and the other is a game genre. More generally, we believe that no red arrow should be taken into account. We make one exception for the edge from Trading Card Game to Card Game. Indeed, we argued in Subsection\u00a0<ref> that Trading Card Game was one of the few tags that are misclassified by our method, and that it should actually be treated as a genre. On another note, we have a group of tags related to non-games, that we mentioned in Subsection\u00a0<ref>. All those tags can be considered as one group of tags related to products offered by Steam that are not games.\n\nWhen looking at Figure\u00a0<ref>, a natural idea is to give a name for all these groups of synonymous tags. This name would be a representative of the group, the one that is most general. For instance, the group (Crowfunded, Kickstarter) would be represented by Kickstarter. Similarly, the group of platformer tags would be represented by Platformer. But how would one deal with the group that contains card game tags and rogue-like tags? Intuitively, this group should be split in two. Likewise, what about the group of tags not related to games? It would seem natural to have most of those tags represented by Utilities, but it is no clear what should happen to Education, as the only edge incident to it is incoming, and not outgoing. We detail in the next paragraph a formal explanation on how to deal with these situations, which results in a grouping that is in accordance with our intuition.\n\nLet G be a directed graph with labeled vertices. First merge all mutual edges of G. For a mutual edge e={u,v}, keep arbitrarily one of the two labels u or v. Let H denote the same graph as G with the orientations of the edges removed, resulting in an unoriented graph. Let us denote by W_1,\u2026,W_k the vertex sets of the k connected components of H. We denote by V_1,\u2026,V_k the same vertex sets considered in G. Let us consider the subgraph G_i of G induced by V_i, for some 1\u2264 i\u2264 k. We say that G_i is well-oriented if there exists a unique vertex v \u2208 V_i such that for each u\u2260 v in V_i, there exists a directed path from u to v in G_i. Making an abuse of notation, we say that G is well-oriented if each G_i is well-oriented.\n\nGoing back to the example in Figure\u00a0<ref>, we see that most connected components are well-oriented. Moreover, for the group of platformer tags, Platformer is the unique tag that can be reached via directed paths from all other tags in the group. However, the group with card game tags and rogue-like tags is not well-oriented. Now, what we suggest for splitting into well-oriented groups is the following: Given the graph G, remove as few edges as possible to make it well-oriented. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been previously studied. However, we believe it is interesting from both a theoretical perspective and for practical applications: an efficient algorithm would be needed for naming the synonym groups. We do not know of any fast algorithm for solving the problem, and wonder whether it is NP-hard. Nonetheless, on the small example we are considering now, we solve the problem by hand. In Figure\u00a0<ref>, it suffices to remove the edges from Roguelike Deckbuilder to Rogue-lite and Rogue-like to obtain a well-oriented graph. We therefore obtain the group (Card Battler, Deckbuilding, Trading Card Game, Roguelike Deckbuilder, Card Game) represented by Card Game, and the group (Roguevania, Action Roguelike, Traditional Roguelike, Rogue-lite, Rogue-like) represented by either Rogue-lite or Rogue-like. Similarly, the group of tags not related to video games is not well-oriented. To make it well oriented, one has to remove the edge from Software Training to either Education or Utilities. Although in this case we solved the problem by hand, it would be very useful to have efficient algorithms for solving this problem for general directed graphs. This would allow us to deal with the synonymous tags on a larger scale.\n\nFinally, we observe that the graph is very similar to the graph of a poset, as was the case in Figure\u00a0<ref>. One could remove the dotted red edges, merge the vertices connected by a mutual edge, and remove the edges we mentioned to make the graph well-oriented. Now it suffices to remove a few edges that give only redundant information, like the one from Photo Editing to Utilities or the one from Roguevania to Rogue-lite/Rogue-like. Our approach yields a meronomy of synonymous tags, with the topmost tags serving as representatives of their respective groups.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSION\n\n\nWe proposed several hypothetical facts, such as the notion that players primarily associate games with their genre. To support this claim, we introduced the concept of priority of Steam tags and demonstrated its relationship to players' perceptions of games. Moreover, our approach enabled us to create a data-driven taxonomy that provides a comprehensive list of genres. We found a set of seven tags, the capital tags, which roughly summarise all information contained in the Steam tags. Those are Multiplayer, Singleplayer, Action, Casual, Adventure, Strategy and Anime, although we argued why the presence of this last tag in the list is dubious at best. We found the tags Multiplayer and Singleplayer extremely interesting as they are capital tags, assigned to thousands of games, but are Low priority tags. We showed how some tags can be merged without loosing too much information. We proposed a criterion for finding a representative of a merged group, and ask whether there exists an efficient algorithm for applying this method.\n\nWe list some further improvements that can be made to our study. We stated that the notion of priority might need to be refined in order to be more consistent, by taking the example of the tag Free to Play. Although considering priority histograms allowed us to define an interesting taxonomy, this method has some limit. In particular for Medium priority tags, we could not find a meaningful way of subdividing this taxon into taxa (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). Maybe some other ideas could allow one to establish a meaningful data-driven classification of Medium Priority tags. Secondly, our method is biased towards games available on Steam, and we acknowledge that this may limit the generalisability of our findings. Also, we note that our computations assume an equal impact for all games. However, according to Orland\u00a0<cit.>, in 2014, over a quarter of registered games on Steam had never been played. Thus, we believe it would be beneficial to consider player engagement metrics, such as the number of players or total hours played, and to weight games accordingly in our computations. We noticed that some Low priority tags are assigned to thousands of games, like Multiplayer and Singleplayer. We believe that they should be investigated further, to better understand how players think about them. Using the knowledge of capital tags, we developed a method for identifying synonymous tags. It would be intriguing to apply this method in a database where synonymous tags are intelligently merged. Our expectation is that, in such a scenario, Anime would no longer be considered a capital tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 LIST OF VIDEO GAME GENRES\n\n\n\n\n    \n  * 2D Fighter, 2D Platformer, 3D Fighter, 3D Platformer, 4X\n    \n  * Action, Action RPG, Action Roguelike, Action-Adventure, Adventure, Arcade, Archery, Arena Shooter, Auto Battler, Automation, Automobile Sim\n    \n  * Base-Building, Battle Royale, Beat 'em up, Board Game, Boxing, Building, Bullet Hell\n    \n  * CRPG, Card Battler, Card Game, Casual, Character Action Game, Chess, Choose Your Own Adventure, City Builder, Clicker, Collectathon, Colony Sim, Combat Racing, Cooking, Creature Collector\n    \n  * Dating Sim, Deckbuilding, Diplomacy, Dungeon Crawler\n    \n  * Education, Exploration\n    \n  * Farming Sim, Fighting, Fishing, Flight, FPS\n    \n  * God Game, Grand Strategy\n    \n  * Hack and Slash, Heist, Hero Shooter, Hidden Object, Horror, Hunting\n    \n  * Idler, Immersive Sim, Interactive Fiction\n    \n  * JRPG\n    \n  * Life Sim, Looter Shooter\n    \n  * Management, Match 3, Metroidvania, Mining, MMORPG, MOBA, Mystery Dungeon\n    \n  * Naval Combat\n    \n  * On-Rails Shooter, Open World Survival Craft, Otome\n    \n  * Parkour, Party Game, Party-Based RPG, Platformer, Point & Click, Political Sim, Precision Platformer, Programming, Puzzle, Puzzle-Platformer\n    \n  * RPG, Racing, Real Time Tactics, Rhythm, Rogue-like, Rogue-lite, Roguelike Deckbuilder, RTS, Runner\n    \n  * Sandbox, Shoot 'Em Up, Shooter, Side Scroller, Simulation, Sokoban, Solitaire, Souls-like, Space Sim, Spectacle fighter, Sports, Stealth, Strategy, Strategy RPG, Survival, Survival Horror\n    \n  * Tabletop, Tactical RPG, Third-Person Shooter, Time Management, Top-Down Shooter, Tower Defense, Trading, Trading Card Game, Traditional Roguelike, Trivia, Turn-Based Strategy, Turn-Based Tactics, Twin Stick Shooter, Typing\n    \n  * Vehicular Combat, Visual Novel\n    \n  * Walking Simulator, Wargame, Word Game\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n"}
