The study of linear dynamics began in 1929 when Birkhoff gave the hypercycle of translation operator in H(\u2102) <cit.> . Then, in 1952, Maclane discovered that differential operator in H(\u2102) is hypercyclic <cit.>. In 1969, Rolewicz showed that linear shifts can have dense orbits in Banach space <cit.>. However, the three papers mentioned above have not attracted much attention for mathematicians.\n The real development of linear operator dynamics was after the publication of Kaitai's thesis <cit.> in 1984, which discussed the problem of invariant subsets of linear operators and gave the Hypercyclic criterion. Since the 1980s, many mathematicians, inspired by the above sporadic examples, have aroused the enthusiasm of researchers and begun to study the dynamical properties of general linear operators, see <cit.>, <cit.>, <cit.>.\n\nWe refer to the books <cit.> or <cit.> for background on linear dynamics, and to the papers <cit.> or <cit.> for a glimpse at the richness of the class of linear dynamical systems and its potential usefulness in general ergodic theory. If T is a bounded operator, the T-orbit of a vector x\u2208 X is the set orb(x,T):={T^nx}_n\u2208\u2124_+. The operator T is said to be hypercyclic if there is some vector x\u2208 X such that orb(x,T) is dense in X. Such a vector x is said to be hypercyclic for T, and the set of all hypercyclic vectors for T is denoted by HC(T). Hypercyclic linear operators with a dense set of periodic points are said to be chaotic. In paper <cit.>, let A be an unbounded operator on a separable infinite dimensional Banach space X. Since A is only densely defined on X, it may happen that a vector f is in the domain of A, but Af fails to be in the domain of A. For this reason, we define A to be hypercyclic if there is a vector f in the domain of A such that for every integer n>1 the vector A^nf is in the domain of A and the orbit {f, Af, A^2f, A^3f,\u22ef} is dense in X. Hypercyclic unbounded operators with a dense set of periodic points are said to be chaotic.\n\nIn <cit.>, S. Rolewicz provides the first example of a hypercyclic bounded linear operator on a Banach space l_p (1\u2264 p<\u221e) or c_0 weighted backward shift:T(x_k)_k\u2208\u2115=w(x_k+1)_k\u2208\u2115, where w\u2208\ud835\udd3d(\ud835\udd3d=\u211d\u00a0or\u00a0\u2102) such that |w|>1 is arbitrary. Rolewicz's operators also happen to chaotic.\n\nIn 2019, Marat V. Markin considers a natural unbounded extension of the classcial Rolewicz weighted backward shift operators<cit.>. He prove the chaoticity and describe the spectral structure of Rolewicz-type weighted backward shift unbounded linear operator in the sequence spaces l_p(1\u2264 p<\u221e) and c_0: A(x_k)_k\u2208\u2115=(w^kx_k+1)_k\u2208\u2115, where w\u2208\u211d or w\u2208\u2102 such that |w|>1 is arbitrary, with the domain D(A)={(x_k)_k\u2208\u2115\u2208 X| (w^kx_k+1)_k\u2208\u2115\u2208 X} where X=l_p(1\u2264 p<\u221e) or c_0.\n\nIn <cit.>, John M. Jimenez and Marat V. Markinn shown that, in L_p(0,\u221e) and C_0[0,\u221e), the bounded weighted backward shift operator (Tx)(t)=wx(t+a)\u00a0(w>1\u00a0and\u00a0a>0) and its unbounded counterpart (Tx)(t)=w^tx(t+a) are chaotic. Combining <cit.> and <cit.>, a natural question is : what are the dynamical properties if we replacing w^t and w with w(t)?\n\n We can define shift operators T with variable weight w(t):\u00a0Tx(t)=w(t)x(t+a).\nWe get the main theorems of this paper:\n\nIn the (real or complex) space L_p(0,\u221e) (1\u2264 p<\u221e) the bounded time varying weight backward shift operator\n\n    Tx(t):   =w(t)x(t+a),\n    \n    T^nx(t):   =\u220f_i=0^n-1w(t+ia)x(t+na),\n\nwhere w(t) bounded and |w(t)|>1, is chaotic. Moreover, supposed the space is complex,\n    \u03c3(T)={\u03bb\u2208\u2102|\u00a0|\u03bb|\u2a7dw_\u221e}\n\nwith \n    \u03c3_p(T)={\u03bb\u2208\u2102|\u00a0|\u03bb|<w_\u221e}\u00a0and\u00a0\u03c3_c(T)={\u03bb\u2208\u2102|\u00a0|\u03bb|=w_\u221e}.\n\n\n\n\nIn the (real or complex) space L_p(0, \u221e), we can define the unbounded time varying weight backward shift operator T\n\n    (Tx)(t)   :=w(t)x(t+a)\n    \n    (T^nx)(t)   :=\u220f_i=0^n-1w(t+ia)x(t+na),\n\nwhere x\u2208 L_p(0, \u221e) and a>0, with domain D(T):={x\u2208 L_p(0, \u221e)|\u222b_0^\u221e|w(t)x(t+a)|^pdt<+\u221e}.\nIf w(t) satisfies the following conditions:\n\n(1)w(t) unbounded and\n\n(2)lim_t\u2192\u221ew(t)=\u221e,\n\n(3)|w(t)|>b>1, (b is a constant).\n\nthen T is chaotic. Moreover, if the space is complex, then\n    \u03c3(T)=\u03c3_p(T)=\u2102.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the (real or complex) space C_0[0, \u221e), we can define the unbounded time varying weighted backward shift operator T\n\n    (Tx)(t)   :=w(t)x(t+a)\n    \n    (T^nx)(t)   :=\u220f_i=0^n-1w(t+ia)x(t+na),\n\nwhere x\u2208 C_0[0, \u221e) and a>0, with domain \n    D(T):={x\u2208 C_0[0, \u221e)|\u00a0lim_t\u2192\u221e|w(t)x(t+a)=0}.\n\nIf w(t) satisfies the following conditions:\n\n(1) w(t) is continuous, w(0)=1 and lim_t\u2192\u221e w(t)=\u221e;\n\n(2)|w(t)|>b>1, (b is a constant) and\n\n(3)max_t\u2208[0,\u221e)|w(t)/w(t-(n-1)a)|\u2192\u221e,\u00a0 n\u2192\u221e,\n\nthen T is hypercyclic.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PRELIMINARY\n\nIn this section, we recall some well-known definitions, referring to <cit.> or <cit.> for more retails. And all operators are considered to be linear operators in a separable Banach space X with\nnorm \u00b7.\n(Hypercyclicity<cit.><cit.>).\nLet \n    T:X\u2192 X\n\nbe a bounded operator in a Banach space(X,\u00b7).

A periodic point for T is a vector x\u2208 X such that T^nx=x for some n\u2208\u2115.\nProvided that a bounded operator T satisfies the following conditions:\n\n(i) T is hypercyclic;\n\n(ii)T has a dense set of periodic points,\n\nthen T is chaotic.\n\n For an operator T in X with domain D(T), the set D(T^\u221e) is by definition the intersection of all D(T^n)'s: \n    D(T^\u221e):=\u22c2_n=0^\u221e D(T^n).\n\nwith x_n:=\u2211_j=0^nT^jx for x\u2208 D(T^\u221e).\n\nIn <cit.>, if T is a closed operator then the space D(T^\u221e) is a separable Frechet space under the topology determined by the seminorms x_n, n=0, 1,  2, \u22ef. There is a natural extension of the concept of hypercyclicity and chaos to unbounded operators, see <cit.> and <cit.>.\n\n(Hypercyclicity <cit.><cit.>).\nLet \n    T:D(T)\u2192 X\n\nbe a unbounded operator in a Banach space(X,\u00b7). A unbounded operator T possessing hypercyclic vectors is called hypercyclic.\n\n A nonzero vector x\u2208 D(T^\u221e) is called hypercyclic for T if its orbit under T, \n    orb(x,T)={T^nx;\u00a0n\u2a7e0}\n is dense in X.\n\n(chaotic<cit.><cit.>).

Supposing a bounded linear operator T on a separable Banach space (X,\u00b7) , we set, for any subsets A,\u00a0B of X,\n    N_T(A,B):={i\u2208\u2115|\u00a0T^i(A)\u2229 B\u2260\u2205}.\n If a bounded operator T is hypercyclic if and only if T is topologically transitive, i.e. N_T(U,V)\u2260\u2205 for all open sets U,\u00a0V\u2260\u2205.\n\n\n  We find that we use the above theorem for bounded linear operators, but for unbounded linear operators, we use\n\n(Sufficient Condition for Hypercyclicity<cit.>)\nLet (X,\u00b7) be a separable infinite-dimensional Banach space and let (T,D(T)) be a densely defined linear operator in X for which the operator T^n is closed for all n\u2208\u2115.\n\nThen the operator T is called hypercyclic if there exists \n    \u03f5\u2282 D(T^\u221e):=\u22c2_n=1^\u221e D(T^n)\n dense in (X,\u00b7) and a mapping S:\u03f5\u2192\u03f5 such that \n\n\n(i) TS=I, (I is the identity mapping on \u03f5) and\n\n(ii)\u2200 x\u2208\u03f5,\u00a0T^nx,S^nx\u21920,\u00a0n\u2192\u221e, in (X, \u00b7).\n\n\n\n(Spectrum Classification<cit.><cit.>). The spectrum \u03c3(T) of a closed linear operator (T,D(T))in a complex Banach space (X,\u00b7) is the union of the following three pairwise disjoint sets:\n\n\u03c3_p(T)={\u03bb\u2208\u2102|\u00a0T-\u03bb Iis not injective},\n\n\u03c3_c(T)={\u03bb\u2208\u2102|\u00a0T-\u03bb Iis injective and not surjective, but R(T-\u03bb I)=X},\n\n\u03c3_r(T)={\u03bb\u2208\u2102|\u00a0T-\u03bb Iis injective and R(T-\u03bb I)\u2260 X},\n\ncalled the point, continuous, and residual spectrum of T.\n\n\n\n\u00a7  PROOF OF THEOREM <REF>\n\nIn this section, we will prove the Theorem <ref>. The tool used to prove that the bounded time varying weighted backward shift operator is  hypercycle is Theorem <ref>.\n\nLet\u00a0U, V\u2282 L_p(0, \u221e)\u00a0be arbitrary nonempty open set. By the denseness in \u00a0L_p(0, \u221e)\u00a0of p integrable eventually zero function, there exist\u00a0x\u2208 U\u00a0and\u00a0y\u2208 V\u00a0. Since these functions are eventually zero, we can find a sufficiently large N\u2208\u2115 such that \n    x(t)=0\u00a0and\u00a0y(t)=0,\u00a0t\u2a7e Na.\n\nFor an arbitrary n\u2a7e N, the p integrable eventually zero function\n\n    z_n(t):=\n    x(t)    t\u2208[0, Na),\n    [\u220f_i=0^n-1w(t-ia+na)]^-1y(t-an)   t\u2208[na, Na+na),\n    \n    0   otherwise,\n\n\u00a0in\u00a0L_p(0,\u221e).\n\nObserve, if t\u2208[0, Na) \n    T^nz_n(t)   =\u220f_i=0^n-1w(t+ia)z_n(t+na)\n       =\u220f_i=0^n-1w(t+ia)[\u220f_i=0^n-1w(t-ia)]^-1y(t)\n       =y(t).\n\nIf t\u2265 Na, \n    T^nz_n(t)   =\u220f_i=0^n-1w(t+ia)z_n(t+na)\n       =0\n       =y(t).\n\nThen\n\n    T^nz_n(t)=y(t), t\u2265 0.\n\nSince w(t) is a bounded function, then \u2203\u00a0m>1 such that |w(t)|\u2265 m.\nThen \n    z_n-x_p   =(\u222b_0^\u221e|z_n(t)-x(t)|^pdt)^1/p\n       =(\u222b_na^Na+na|1/\u220f_i=0^n-1w(t+ia-na)y(t-na) |^pdt)^1/p\n       \u2a7d1/m^ny_p\u2192 0, n\u2192\u221e.\n\n\nConsequently, for all sufficiently large n\u2208\u2115,\u00a0z_n\u2208 U\u00a0and\u00a0T^nz_n=y\u2208 V. Thus T is topologically transitive.\nBy the Birkhoff Transitivity Theorem, T is hypercyclic.\n\nNow, we are going to show that  T has a dense set of periods points. By the denseness in L_p(0, \u221e) of the equivalence classes represented by p-integrable eventually zero functions, it suffices to approximate any such a class by periodic points of T.\n\nFor any x\u2208 L_p(0, Na) represented by a p-integrable on (0, Na) function x(\u00b7) and \u2200 N\u2208\u2115, the following p-integrable on (0, \u221e) function\n\n    x_N(t):=1/\u220f_i=1^kNw(t-ia)x(t-kNa), t\u2208 D_k,\n\nwhere D_k=[kNa,(k+1)Na), k\u2208 Z_+. Since\n \n    T^Nx_N(t)   =\u220f_i=0^N-1w(t+ia)x_N(t+Na)\n       =\u220f_i=0^N-1w(t+ia)1/\u220f_i=1^kNw(t+Na-ia)x(t-(k-1)Na)\n       =1/\u220f_i=1^(k-1)Nw(t-ia)x(t-(k-1)Na).\n\n Thus T^Nx_N(t)=x_N(t), then we can get x_N(T) is a periodic point of T with period N.\n\n Now we can show that x_N\u2208 L_p(0, \u221e). Indeed,\n \n    \u222b_0^\u221e|x_N(t)|^pdt   =\u222b_0^\u221e|[\u220f_i=1^kNw(t-ia)]^-1x(t-kNa)|^pdt\n       =\u2211_k=0^\u221e\u222b_D_k1/\u220f_i=1^kN|w(t-ia)|^p|x(t-kNa)|^pdt\n       \u2a7d\u2211_k=0^\u221e1/m^kNp\u222b_D_k|x(t-kNa)|^Pdt\n       =\u2211_k=0^\u221e1/m^kNp\u222b_0^Na|x(t)|^pdt.\n\nSince m>1 and x(t)\u2208 L_p(0, Na), then \u222b_0^\u221e|x(t)|^pdt<\u221e. Thus x_N(t)\u2208 L_p(0, \u221e).\n\nNow, let \u2200\u00a0y\u2208 L_p(0, \u221e), then \u2203\u00a0n\u2208\u2115,\u00a0y(t)=0,\u00a0t>na.\u00a0Let y_N be the periodic point of T of an arbitrary period N>n, defied base on y(\u00b7) as in (3.1).\n\nThus,\n\n    y-y_N_p   =(\u222b_0^\u221e|y(t)-y_N(t)|^pdt)^1/p\n       =\u2211_k=0^\u221e(\u222b_D_k|y(t)-y_N(t)|^pdt)^1/p\n       =(\u222b_0^Na|y-y_N(t)|^pdt)^1/p+\u2211_k=1^\u221e(\u222b_D_k|y(t)-y_N(t)|^p)^1/p\n       =0+\u2211_k=1^\u221e(\u222b_D_k|y_N(t)|^p)^1/p\n       \u2a7d\u2211_k=1^\u221em^-kNy_p\n       =m^-N/1-m^-Ny_p\u21920,\u00a0N\u2192\u221e.\n\n\nThis implies that the set Per(T) of periodic points of T in dense in L_p(0, \u221e), and hence the operator is chaotic.\n\nNow, suppose that the space L_p(0,\u221e) is complex, we analyze the spectrum of operator T.\n\nFirstly, we show that T=w_\u221e.\nWe can get that T\u2a7dw_\u221e, since\n    T=sup_x_p=1Tx_p   =w_\u221esup_x_p=1[\u222b_0^+^\u221e|x(t+a)|^p\u00a0dt]^1/p\n       \u2a7dw_\u221esup_x_p=1[\u222b_0^+\u221e|x(t)|^p\u00a0dt]^1/p\n       \u2a7dw_\u221esup_x_p=1[\u222b_0^+\u221e|x(t)|^p\u00a0dt]^1/p\n       =w_\u221e.\n\nWe can find that operator T can decomposed into the product of  V and \u03c4_a, where V: x(t)\u21a6 w(t)x(t) and \u03c4_a: x(t)\u21a6 x(t+a). For x\u2208 L_p(0,+\u221e), we have \n    T\u03c4_-ax(t)=Tx(t-a)=w(t)x(t)=Vx(t),\n then T\u00b7\u03c4_-a=V. Thus V=V\u2a7dT\u03c4_-a=T where \u03c4_-a=1. Then we can get T=w_\u221e.

Then, if we prove that the unbounded time varying weight shift operator is hypercycle, Theorem <ref> will not be used, but Theorem <ref> will be used. Now let's prove the theorem <ref>.\n\nFirstly, we show that T is unbounded.\nConsider \n    x_n(t):=\u03c7_[n, n+1](t)=1,\u00a0\u00a0t\u2208[n, n+1],\n    0,\u00a0\u00a0otherwise.\n\nx_n\u2208 D(T) and x_n_p=1, n\u2208\u2115.\n\nThen, for all sufficiently large n\u2208\u2115,\n\n    \u222b_0^\u221e|Tx_n(t)|^pdt   =\u222b_0^\u221e|w(t)x_n(t+a)|^pdt\n       =\u222b_n-a^n+1-a|w(t)|^pdt\u2192\u221e,\u00a0n\u2192\u221e.\n\nWhich implies that T is unbounded.\n\nSecondly, we will show that T^l is closed for each l\u2208\u2115. Let a sequence (x_n)_n\u2208\u2115 be such that\n\n    D(T)\u220b x_n\u2192 x\u2208 L_p(0, \u221e),\u00a0n\u2192\u221e\n\nand\n\n    T^lx_n\u2192 y\u2208 L_p(0, \u221e),\u00a0n\u2192\u221e.\n\n\nThen, the function sequences (x_n(\u00b7))_n\u2208\u2115 and (T^lx_n(\u00b7))_n\u2208\u2115 being convergent in p-norm, converge in the Lebesgue measure on (0,\u221e),\nand hence, by the Riesz theorem, there exist subsequences (x_n_k(\u00b7))_k\u2208\u2115 and (T^lx_n_k(\u00b7))_k\u2208\u2115 such that\n\n    x_n_k(t)   \u2192 x(t),\u00a0k\u2192\u221e,\u00a0a.e. t\u2208(0,\u221e),\n    \n    T^lx_n_k(t)   \u2192 y(t),\u00a0k\u2192\u221e,\u00a0a.e. t\u2208(0,\u221e).\n\nThus, \n    \u220f_i=0^l-1w(t+ia)x_n_k(t+la)\u2192\u220f_i=0^l-1w(t+ia)x(t+la),\u00a0a.e.\u00a0t\u2208(0,\u221e).\n\nBy the completeness of the Lebesgue measure, we infer that\nWhich implies that x\u2208 D(T^l)\u00a0and\u00a0T^lx=y. It following that T^l is closed. Next, we are going to show that T is hypercyclic.\n\nLet \u03f5 be the set of the equivalence classes represented by p-integrable eventually zero functions.

Therefore,\n    \u2200 N\u2208\u2115,\u00a0x_N\u2208 L_p(0,\u221e).\n\n If y\u2208 C_0(0,\u221e), then \n    \u2203 n\u2208\u2115,\u00a0y(t)=0,\u00a0t>na.\n\n For an arbitrary period N\u2a7e n, we defined y_N with the following representative\n\n    y_N(t):=1/\u220f_i=1^kNw(t-ia)y(t-kNa),\u00a0t\u2208[kNa,(k+1)Na),\u00a0k\u2208\u2124_+.\n\nNow, we prove that \n    y-y_N_p^p\u21920,\u00a0N\u2192\u221e.\n\nSince|w(t)|>b>1, we have\n\n    y-y_N_p^p   =\u222b_0^\u221e|y(t)-y_N(t)|^p\u00a0dt\n       =\u2211_k=1^\u221e\u222b_D_k1/|\u220f_i=1^kNw(t-ia)|^p|y(t-kNa)^p\u00a0dt\n       \u2a7d\u2211_k=1^\u221e\u222b_D_k1/b^kNp|y(t-kNa)|^p\u00a0dt\n       =\u2211_k=1^\u221e1/b^kNp\u222b_0^Na|y(t)|^p\u00a0dt\u21920,\u00a0N\u2192\u221e.\n\nWe have already shown that per(T) is dense in L_p(0,\u221e). And, which implies that the operator T is a chaotic.\nNow, if the space L_p(0,\u221e) is complex, we analyse the spectrum of T.\n\nWe already know the fact \n    \u03c3_p(T)\u2282\u2102.\n\nThus, we only show that \n    \u2102\u2282\u03c3_p(T).\n\nFor \u2200\u03bb\u2208\u2102 and a nonzero y\u2208 L_p(0,a), we define that\n\n    x(t):=\u03bb^n/\u220f_i=1^nw(t-ia)y(t-na),\u00a0t\u2208[na,(n+1)a),\u00a0n\u2208\u2124_+.\n\nSince\n    \u222b_0^\u221e|x(t)|^p\u00a0dt=\u2211_n=0^\u221e\u222b_D_n|\u03bb^n/\u220f_i=1^nw(t-ia)y(t-na)|^p\u00a0dt<\u221e.\n\nWhich implies that x\u2208 L_p(0,\u221e)\u2216{0} and\n\n    Tx=\u03bb x.\n\nThus \u2102\u2282\u03c3_p, it is following that \n    \u03c3(T)=\u03c3_p(T)=\u2102.\n\n\nNow we will give an example of unbounded time varying weight backward shift operator in L_p(0,\u221e), 1\u2264 p<\u221e.\n\nIn the (real or complex) space L_p(0,\u221e), we define that the unbounded weight backward shift operator T:\n\n    (Tx)(t)   :=[a_mt^m+a_m-1t^m-1+\u22ef+a_0]x(t+a)\n    \n    (T^nx)(t)   :=\u220f_i=0^n-1P_m(t+ia)x(t+na),\n\nwhere P_m(t)=a_mt^m+a_m-1t^m-1+\u22ef+a_0,\u00a0m>1,\u00a0a_i>0,\u00a0i=0,1,2,\u22ef,m and a>0, with domain \n    D(T)={x\u2208 L_p(0,\u221e)|\u00a0\u222b_0^\u221e|P_m(t)x(t+a)|^p\u00a0dt<\u221e},\n\nis chaotic.\n\n\nWe first show that T is unbounded.\n\nConsider \n    x_n(t):=\u03c7_[n,n+1](t)=1,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0t\u2208[n,n+1],\n    0,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0otherwise\nas a representative of a class x_n\u2208 D(T).

Since \u2200 x(t)\u2208\u03f5, we have that\n\n    TS(x(t))   =T(1/P_m(t-a)x(t-a))\n       =P_m(t)1/P_m(t)x(t)\n       =x(t).\n\nThus \n    TS=I.\n\nLet x\u2208\u03f5 represented by x(\u00b7) be arbitrary and supp\u00a0x be the support of x(\u00b7) i.e {t\u2208(0,\u221e)|\u00a0x(t)\u22600}.\nSince x(\u00b7) is eventually zero, \u2203 N\u2208\u2115, \n    supp\u00a0x\u2286[0,Na].\n\nWe can easily show that \u2200 x\u2208\u03f5, \n    T^nx\u2192 0(n\u2192\u221e).\n\nSince by the definition of T,\u00a0\u2200 n\u2a7e\u2115,\n\n    T^nx(t)=\u220f_i=0^n-1P_m(t+ia)x(t+na)=0.\n\nNext, we will prove that \n    \u2200 x\u2208\u03f5,\u00a0S^nx\u21920\u00a0(n\u2192\u221e).\n\nWhen \u2200 x\u2208\u03f5 and \u2200 n\u2208\u2115, we can conclude that\n\n    (S^nx)(t)=1/\u220f_i=1^nP_m(t-ia)x(t-na),\u00a0   t>na,\n    0,   otherwise.\n\nSince \n    1/|\u220f_i=1^nP_m(na-ia)|^p\u21920,\u00a0n\u2192\u221e,\n\nwe have that\n\n    S^nx_p^p   =\u222b_0^\u221e|S^nx(t)|^p\u00a0dt\n       =\u222b_na^\u221e|1/\u220f_i=1^nP_m(na-ia)x(t-na)|^p\u00a0dt\n       \u2a7d1/|\u220f_i=1^nP_m(na-ia)|^p\u222b_na^+\u221e|x(t-na)|^p\u00a0dt\n       \u2a7d1/|\u220f_i=1^nP_m(na-ia)|^px_p^p\n       \u21920,\u00a0n\u2192\u221e.\n\nTherefore, by the Sufficient\u00a0Condition\u00a0for\u00a0Hypercyclicity(), the operator T is hypercyclic.\n\nNow, we are to show that T has a dense set of periodic point. Since \n    C_0(0,\u221e)\u2282 L_p(0,\u221e)\n and C_0 is dense in L_p,\nwe just show that per(T) is dense in C_0.\n\nIndeed, for any x\u2208 L_p(0,Na) and \u2200 N\u2208\u2115, we define the x_N\u2208 L_p(0,\u221e) with the following representative\n\n    x_N(t):=1/\u220f_i=1^kNP_m(t-ia)x(t-kNa),\u00a0t\u2208[kNa,(k+1)Na),\u00a0k\u2208\u2124_+.\n\nSince\n\n    T^Nx_N(t)   =\u220f_i=0^N-1P_m(t+ia)1/\u220f_i=1^kNP_m(t+Na-ia)x(t-kNa+Na)\n       =1/\u220f_i=Na+1^kNP_m(t-ia)x(t-kNa+Na)\n       =1/\u220f_i=1^(k-1)NP_m(t-ia)x(t-(k-1)Na)\n       =x_N(t),\n\nwe have that x_N(t) is a periodic point of T with period N.\n\nIn fact, with \n    D_k:=[kNa,(k+1)Na),\u00a0k\u2208\u2124_+,\n\nwe get that\n\n    \u222b_0^\u221e|x_N(t)|^p\u00a0dt   =\u2211_k=0^\u221e\u222b_D_k|1/\u220f_i=1^kNP_m(t-ia)x(t-kNa)|^p\u00a0dt\n       \u2a7d\u2211_k=0^\u221e\u222b_D_k|1/(a_0)^kN|^p|x(t-kNa)|^p\u00a0dt\n       =\u2211_k=0^\u221e1/a_0^kNp\u222b_0^Na|x(t)|^p\u00a0dt<\u221e\n\nby a_0>1 and x\u2208 L_p(0,Na). Thus for any N\u2208\u2115, x_N\u2208 L_p(0,\u221e).\n\nLet y\u2208 C_0(0,\u221e), then \n    \u2203 n\u2208\u2115,\u00a0y(t)=0,\u00a0t>na.\n\nLet y_N be the periodic point of T of an arbitrary period N\u2a7e n defined based on y(\u00b7) as in ( ).\n\nNow, we show that per(T) is dense in C_0(0,\u221e). Since by a_0>1 and y\u2208 L_p(0,\u221e), we have that\n\n    y-y_N_P^P   =\u222b_0^\u221e|y(t)-y_N(t)|^p\u00a0dt\n       =\u2211_k=1^\u221e\u222b_D_k|1/\u220f_i=1^kNP_m(t-ia)y(t-kNa)|^p\u00a0dt\n       \u2a7d\u2211_k=1^\u221e1/a_0^kNpy_p^p  \u21920,\u00a0N\u2192\u221e.\n\n\n\nThus which implies that the set per(T) of periodic points of T is dense in L_p(0,\u221e), and hence, the operator T is chaotic.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PROOF OF THEOREM <REF>\n\nIn this section, we will prove Theorem <ref>.\n\nWe first show that the operator T is unbounded. Consider x_n\u2208 D(T) such that x_n_\u221e=1.\n\nLet the function\n\n    x_n=1,\u00a0   t\u2208[0,na),\n    1/w^2(t-na),\u00a0   t\u2a7e na\n\nSince\n\n    Tx_n_\u221e=max_t\u2a7e0|w(t)x_n(t+a)|\u2a7emax_t\u2a7e(n-1)a|w(t)/w(t-(n-1)a)|\u2192\u221e,\u00a0n\u2192\u221e.\n\nThus, the operator T is unbounded.\n\nNext, we are to show that T^l is closed for \u2200 m\u2208\u2115. Let a sequence (x_n)_n\u2208\u2115 be such that\n\n    D(T^l)\u220b x_n\u2192 x\u2208 C_0[0,\u221e),\u00a0n\u2192\u221e,\n\nand\n\n    T^lx_n\u2192 y\u2208 C_0[0,\u221e),\u00a0n\u2192\u221e.\n\nHence, \u2200\u00a0t\u2a7e0,,\n\n    T^lx_n(t)=\u220f_i=0^l-1x_n(t+la)\u2192\u220f_i=0^l-1w(t+la)x(t+la),\u00a0n\u2192\u221e.\n\nWhich implies that \n    \u220f_i=0^l-1w(t+ia)x(t+la)=y(t),\u00a0t\u2a7e0.\n\nTherefore x\u2208 D(T^l) and T^lx=y. So T^l is closed.\n\nLet \u03b5 be the dense in C_0[0,\u221e) of continuous function with compact support.\n\nConsider\n\n    \u03f5\u220b x\u21a6 Sx\u2208\u03f5,\n\nwhere Sx is defined by \n    S(x)(t)=x(0)/at,   t<a,\n    1/w(t-a)x(t-a),   t\u2a7e a.\n\nThe mapping S:\u03f5\u2192\u03f5 is well defined, and \u2200 x\u2208\u03f5,\n\n    TSx(t)=w(t)Sx(t+a)=w(t)x(t)/w(t)=Ix(t).\n\nThus we get that TS=I.\n\nNow, we prove that for \u2200 x\u2208\u03f5,\n    T^nx\u21920,\u00a0n\u2192\u221e.\n\nIndeed, let \u2200 x\u2208\u03f5, then there exists N\u2208\u2115, \n    supp\u00a0x\u2282 [0,Na].\n\nBy the definition of T,\n    \u2200 n\u2a7e N,\u00a0T^nx=0,\n\nwhich implies that T^n\u21920,\u00a0n\u2192\u221e.\n\nNext, we will show that \n    S^n\u21920,\u00a0n\u2192\u221e.\n\nInductively, for any n\u2208\u2115,\n\n    (S^n)(t)=0,\u00a0\u00a0   0\u2a7d t<(n-1)a,\n    1/w(t-a)w(t-2a)\u22ef w(t-na)x(0)/a(t-(n-1)a),\u00a0\u00a0   (n-1)a\u2a7d t<na,\n    1/w(t-a)w(t-2a)\u22ef w(t-na)x(t-na),\u00a0\u00a0   t\u2a7e na.\n\nSince\n\n    S^nx_\u221e   =sup_t\u2a7e0|(S^nx)(t)|\n       \u2a7d1/b^nx(t-na)\u21920,\u00a0n\u2192\u221e.\n\nSo, by Theorem <ref>, we know T is Hypercyclicity.\n\nWe find that the operators given in the <cit.> are examples of our thesis.\n\nunsrt\n\n\n"}
