Blair Blakie\n    March 30, 2023\n==================================================\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\nA dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is made up of particles with a significant dipole moment, making dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) important. Highly magnetic atoms have been used in experiments to create dipolar BECs <cit.> and explore various phenomena arising from these interactions <cit.>.\nIn the dipole-dominated regime, where DDIs dominate over short-ranged interactions, quantum droplets can be formed. These droplets are mechanically unstable at the mean-field level, but are stabilized against collapse by quantum fluctuations  <cit.>. Experiments using dysprosium <cit.> and erbium <cit.> atoms have prepared and measured various properties of these quantum droplets, which have a filament-like shape due to the anisotropy of the DDIs.\n\n \nThe extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (EGPE) provides a theoretical description of the ground states and dynamics of quantum droplets, incorporating quantum fluctuation effects within a local density approximation. The collective excitations of  these quantum droplets are described by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations, which can be obtained by linearizing the time-dependent EGPE about a ground state. Baillie et al.\u00a0<cit.> presented the results of numerical calculations of the collective excitations of a  dipolar quantum droplet (also see <cit.>). Additionally, a class of three shape excitations has been approximated using a Gaussian variational ansatz <cit.>. Experiments have measured the lowest energy shape excitation, corresponding to the lowest nontrivial axial mode, for a large trapped droplet <cit.>. Experiments with dysprosium droplets have also  measured the scissors-mode <cit.>.   \n\nIn this paper,  we consider dipolar quantum droplet ground states and the m=0 (projection of angular momentum quantum number) collective excitations in free-space   and in trapped cases. We focus on a low energy axial collective excitation, which softens to zero energy to reveal the unbinding (evaporation) point for a free-space quantum droplet.\nWe use a sum rule approach to estimate the excitation frequency of this mode in terms of the ground state properties, including its static response to a small change in the axial trapping frequency. We compare the result of this sum rule method to the excitation frequency obtained by direct numerical solution of the BdG equations. We verify that the sum rule predictions are accurate over a wide parameter regime, including deeply bound droplet states, droplets close to the unbinding threshold, and in the trapped situation where the droplet crosses over to a trap-bound BEC. \n\n\n \n\n\u00a7 FORMALISM\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Ground states\n\n \nHere we consider a gas of magnetic bosonic atoms described by EGPE energy functional \n\n    E    = \u222b d \u03c8^*[h_sp+12g_s|\u03c8|^2+12  +25|\u03c8|^3]\u03c8,\n \nwhere \n\n    h_sp   =-\u0127^2/2M\u2207^2+V(\ud835\udc31),\n    \n    V(\ud835\udc31)   =1/2M (\u03c9_x^2x^2+\u03c9_y^2y^2+\u03c9_z^2z^2),\n \nare the single particle Hamiltonian and the harmonic trapping potential, respectively.\nHere g_s = 4\u03c0\u0127^2 a_s/M is the coupling constant for the contact interactions, where a_s is the s-wave scattering length.\nThe  potential\n\n    ()=\u222b d' (-')|\u03c8(')|^2,\n\ndescribes the long-ranged DDIs, where the magnetic moments of the atoms are polarized along z with\n\n    () = 3/4\u03c0 r^3(1-3z^2/r^2).\n\nHere =4\u03c0\u0127^2/M is the DDI coupling constant, with = M\u03bc_0\u03bc_m^2/12\u03c0\u0127^2 being the dipolar length, and \u03bc_m the atomic magnetic moment. The quantum fluctuations are described by the nonlinear term with coefficient = 32/3 g_s\u221a(a_s^3/\u03c0)\ud835\udcac_5() where \n\n    \ud835\udcac_5(x)={\u222b_0^1 du [1+x(3u^2 - 1)]^5/2},\n <cit.> and \u2261/a_s.

These excitations can be obtained by linearising the time-dependent EGPE  i\u0127\u03a8\u0307= \u2112_EGP\u03a8 around a ground state using an expansion of the form \n\n    \u03a8=e^-i\u03bc t   [\u03c8(\ud835\udc31) +\u2211_\u03bd{\u03bb_\u03bd u_\u03bd(\ud835\udc31)e^-i\u03c9_\u03bdt-\u03bb_\u03bd ^*v^*_\u03bd(\ud835\udc31)e^i\u03c9_\u03bdt}],\n\nwhere  \u03bb_\u03bd are the (small) expansion coefficients.\nThe excitation modes  u_\u03bd,v_\u03bd and frequencies \u03c9_\u03bd satisfy the BdG equations\n\n    [    \u2112_EGP - \u03bc + X               -X;                X -(\u2112_EGP - \u03bc + X) ][ u_\u03bd; v_\u03bd ]   = \u0127\u03c9_\u03bd[ u_\u03bd; v_\u03bd ],\n\n\nwhere X is the exchange operator given by\n\n\n    Xf \u2261   g_s|\u03c8_0|^2f+\u03c8_0\u222b d\ud835\udc31' U_dd(\ud835\udc31-\ud835\udc31') f(\ud835\udc31')\u03c8_0^*(\ud835\udc31')\n       \n       +32 \u03b3_QF |\u03c8_0|^3f.\n\nMore details of the Bogoliubov analysis of the EGPE can be found in Ref.\u00a0<cit.>.  Here we will consider problems with rotational symmetry about the z axis, which restricts the trap to  cases with \u03c9_x=\u03c9_y. This symmetry means that the excitations can be chosen to have a well-defined z-component of angular momentum, \u0127 m, where we have introduced   m=0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u2026 as the quantum number. \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Sum rule approach for lowest compressional mode\n\nWe now wish to discuss a method for extracting the low energy axial compressional mode. We consider the mode excited by  the axial operator \u03c3_z=\u222b d\ud835\udc31 \u03c8\u0302^\u2020 z^2\u03c8\u0302,  where \u03c8\u0302 is the bosonic quantum field operator.\n The energy (\u0127\u03c9_ub) of the lowest mode excited by \u03c3_z  has an upper bound provided by the ratio \u221a(m_1/m_-1), where  we have introduced m_p=\u222b d\u03c9 (\u0127\u03c9)^pS_z(\u03c9) as the p-moment of  S_z(\u03c9) <cit.>. \nHere \n\n    S_z(\u03c9)=\u0127\u2211_p|\u27e8 p |\u03c3_z|0\u27e9|^2\u03b4(E_p-E_0-\u0127\u03c9),\n\n is the zero temperature dynamic structure factor, with |p\u27e9 being the eigenstate of the second quantized Hamiltonian  H of energy E_p, and |0\u27e9 denotes the ground state. \n The m_1 moment can be evaluated using a commutation relation as\n \n    m_1=1/2\u27e8 0|[\u03c3_z,[H,\u03c3_z]]|0\u27e9=2N\u0127^2\u27e8 z^2\u27e9/M.\n\nThe m_-1 moment can be evaluated as m_-1=1/2\u03c7_zz (see <cit.>), where \u03c7_zz is the static polarizability quantifying the linear response of \u03c3_z  to the application of  the  perturbation -\u03bb\u03c3_z to the Hamiltonian, i.e.\u00a0\u03b4\u27e8\u03c3_z\u27e9=\u03bb\u03c7_zz.  Setting \u03bb\u2261 -1/2M \u03b4\u03c9_z^2, we see that this  perturbation is equivalent to a change in the axial trapping frequency, and hence the static polarizability can be evaluated as\n\n    \u03c7_zz=-2N\u03b4\u27e8 z^2\u27e9/M\u03b4\u03c9_z^2,\n\nalso see <cit.>. Thus we obtain the following as an upper-bound estimate of the lowest mode frequency\n\n    \u03c9_ub=\u221a(4N\u27e8 z^2\u27e9/M\u03c7_zz).\n\nA similar approach was used in Ref.\u00a0<cit.> to estimate the scissors mode frequency of a dipolar droplet, but in that work the z-component of angular momentum was the relevant excitation operator.\n \n It is also of interest to understand the static polarizability quantifying the change in the transverse width (with operator  \u03c3_\u03c1=\u222b d\ud835\udc31 \u03c8\u0302^\u2020\u03c1^2\u03c8\u0302, where \u03c1=\u221a(x^2+y^2)) to the axial perturbation, i.e.\u00a0\n \n    \u03c7_\u03c1 z=-2N\u03b4\u27e8\u03c1^2\u27e9/M\u03b4\u03c9_z^2.\n\nLater we will consider both the axial \u03c7_zz and transverse \u03c7_\u03c1 z static polarizabilities to characterize the quantum droplet behavior.\n \n  \n \n\n\n \n\n\u00a7 RESULTS FOR FREE-SPACE DROPLETS\n\n \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Energetics\n\n In Fig.\u00a0<ref>  we consider a free-space (self-bound) ^164Dy droplet for a_s=80 a_0 (i.e.\u00a0\u03f5_dd=1.64) as a function of N. For N>N_crit\u22482020 a self-bound droplet solution exists[This value of N_crit is slightly higher than the value obtained  in Ref.\u00a0<cit.> for the same physical parameters. This is because we use the result mathcalQ_5(\u03f5_dd), rather than the approximation 1+3/2\u03f5_dd^2, to define \u03b3_QF.],  while for N<N_crit there is no droplet solution, and the atoms expand to fill all space.\n  In Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a) we examine the energy of the free-space droplet, seeing that as N approaches N_crit from above the total energy of the droplet becomes positive (for N\u22722,350, see inset). When the energy is positive the droplet is metastable.  We show some examples of the droplet states in  Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c) to give some context on the size and shape of the droplet as N varies.\n  \n  We also consider the components of energy, defined by\n  \n    E_kin   =-\u0127^2/2M\u222b d\ud835\udc31 \u03c8^*\u2207^2\u03c8,\n    \n     E_pot   =\u222b d\ud835\udc31  V(\ud835\udc31)|\u03c8|^2,\n    \n     E_s    =1/2g_s\u222b d\ud835\udc31 |\u03c8|^4,\n    \n     E_dd   =1/2\u222b d\ud835\udc31 \u03a6_dd(\ud835\udc31)|\u03c8|^2,\n    \n      E_QF   =2/5\u222b d\ud835\udc31 |\u03c8|^5\n\n as the kinetic, potential, contact interaction, DDI, and quantum fluctuation energy, respectively. \nFor this free-space case E_pot=0. We observe that the DDI and contact interaction energies are the largest energies by magnitude, but have opposite sign. The quantum fluctuation term is necessary to stabilise the droplet solution against mechanical collapse driven by the interaction terms, but is typically significantly smaller in magnitude than either of the interaction energies. The kinetic energy is smaller than all other components except  when N\u2192 N_crit,  where it can exceed   E_QF.\n \nA virial relation for the system can be obtained by considering how the energy functional transforms under a scaling of coordinates (e.g.\u00a0see <cit.>). For the dipolar EGPE in a harmonic trap this relation is \n \n    \u039b\u2261 E_kin-E_pot+3/2(E_s+E_dd)+9/4E_QF=0,\n\n and provides a connection between the energy components   <cit.>. In Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a) we show \u039b for reference.  This turns out to be a sensitive test of the accuracy of dipolar quantum droplet solutions <cit.>, and the results we present here typically have |\u039b/Nh|\u226a10^-3Hz. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Excitations\n\n\n \n  In Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b) we show the spectrum of m=0 modes in the droplet as a function of N. Excitations for other m values have been examined in Ref.\u00a0<cit.>. The lowest energy excitation branch for the quantum droplets is m=0 (this is not the case for vortex states, e.g.\u00a0see <cit.>).  We note that the excitations are measured relative to the condensate chemical potential. Thus excitations with \u0127\u03c9_\u03bd>-\u03bc are unbounded by the droplet potential and are part of the continuum. For this reason we only calculate excitations with \u0127\u03c9_\u03bd<-\u03bc. From these results we observe that the lowest  m=0 mode goes soft (i.e.\u00a0approaches zero energy) as N\u2192 N_crit. This indicates the onset of a dynamical instability of the self-bound state. We also show the excitation frequency bound \u03c9_ub obtained from ground state calculations according to Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). This is seen to be in good agreement with the BdG result for the lowest excitation over the full range of atom numbers considered.\n  \n  \n \n\n  \n  In Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c) we show results for the static polarizabilities. The axial result \u03c7_zz [used in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>)] is always positive, reflecting that the application of a weak axial confinement to the free-space droplet causes it to shorten. The magnitude of \u03c7_zz tends to be much larger than \u03c7_\u03c1 z, so we have scaled it by a factor of 10^-2 to make the two polarizabilities easier to compare.  The transverse response \u03c7_\u03c1 z changes sign depending on the atom number. In the deeply bound droplet regime (i.e.\u00a0for N>5\u00d7 10^3, where \u03bc is large and negative), it is negative. Thus a weak compression along z results in the droplet expanding transversally.  In contrast, closer to the unbinding threshold (N<5\u00d7 10^3),  \u03c7_\u03c1 z  is positive, and the transverse width will decrease with axial compression. This occurs as the lowest m=0 mode starts to soften.  This change in  behaviour of the transverse response occurs as the lowest excitation mode changes from quadrupolar character at high N to monopole (compressional) character at low N <cit.>.\n  \n  \n  \n \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results with varying a_s\n\n \nIn Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a) we show results for the m=0 excitations of a free-space droplet with a fixed number N=10^4, but with a_s varying. Here the droplet unbinds at a_s\u224898.5 a_0, when the lowest energy mode goes soft. The BdG calculations for the energy of the lowest mode are again seen to be in good agreement with the results of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). In  Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b) we examine the response of the ground state to a change in axial confinement.  For the deeply bound droplet  (a_s\u2272  87 a_0) \u03c7_\u03c1 z is negative, while close to unbinding (a_s\u2273  87 a_0) it becomes positive [see inset to Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b)]. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\u00a7 RESULTS FOR TRAPPED DROPLET\n\n In Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a) we show the excitation spectrum for a droplet confined in a weak cigar-shaped trap (\u03c9_x,y,\u03c9_z)=2\u03c0\u00d7(20,10)Hz. This geometry allows a smooth crossover between a self-bound droplet and a trap-bound dipolar BEC. Apart from the trap, the parameters of these results are otherwise identical to the case studied in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. For a_s\u227295 a_0 the lowest excitation energies, and chemical potential are similar for the trapped and untrapped cases. A notable feature is the emergence of a Kohn mode at the axial trap frequency[The transverse Kohn modes, with frequency \u03c9_x,y, are in the m=\u00b11 excitation branches and do not appear here.] \u03c9_z. For a_s\u227395 a_0 the trap starts playing an increasingly important role. In this regime the droplet self-binding begins to fail and the trap provides the confinement  [see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c)].  As this happens the chemical potential becomes positive. Since the trap binds excitations at all energy scales, we show BdG results with \u0127\u03c9_\u03bd>-\u03bc.\n \n \nFor the full range of parameters considered in  Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a)   Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is seen to provide an accurate description of the axial mode. The lower energy Kohn mode has no effect on our sum rule since the symmetry of the that mode does not couple tothe \u03c3_z operator. \n  In Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a) we also present results for the transverse equivalent of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), i.e.\u00a0\n  \n    \u03c9_2\u2261\u221a(4N\u27e8\u03c1^2\u27e9/M\u03c7_\u03c1\u03c1),\n\n  where \u03b4\u27e8\u03c3_\u03c1\u27e9=\u03bb\u03c7_\u03c1\u03c1 defines the static polarizability for a transverse perturbation of -\u03bb\u03c3_\u03c1. \n  The frequency estimate of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is in reasonable agreement with the second even mode in the trap-bound region, but ascends to a high frequency in the droplet regime. These results indicate that Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is of limited use in the droplet regime. \n    \n    We  show results for the static polarizabilities in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b). In the droplet regime \u03c7_zz\u226b|\u03c7_\u03c1\u03c1|,|\u03c7_\u03c1 z|, while in the trap-bound regime they all become of comparable magnitudes. Interestingly \u03c7_\u03c1 z is positive at intermediate values of a_s.  Correspondingly we find that the axial mode changes character from being a quadrupolar excitation at low a_s values, to monopolar at intermediate values, before returning to quadrupolar character at high values of a_s. Aspects of this behavior has also been described within a variational Gaussian approach <cit.>.\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS\n\n  \n In this work we have presented results for the ground state properties of quantum droplets, their collective excitations and static polarizibility related to  a change in confinement. The lowest energy collective mode has been measured in experiments by  Chomaz et al.\u00a0<cit.>, and plays a critical role in the instability of a free-space droplet. We have shown that a simple sum rule approach can accurately predict the frequency of this mode over a wide parameter regime. Our results for the static polarizabilities quantify changes in the widths of the droplet in response to variations in the axial or transverse confinement. We observe that the transverse static polarizability (to an axial confinement change) is negative in deeply-bound droplets and crosses over to being positive in weakly-bound or trap-bound droplets. This change correlates with lowest excitation changing from  quadrupolar (incompressible) to monopolar (compressible) character. \n  \n\n \n \n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nPBB wishes to acknowledge use of the New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI) high performance computing facilities and support from the Marsden Fund of the Royal Society of New Zealand.
