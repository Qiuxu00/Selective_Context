On restricting considerations to the  \nrank 1 real perturbation matrices, we prove that the distance in question equals \u221a(z_\u2217) where \nz_\u2217 is a  positive (generically, the least positive) zero of the algebraic equation\n\n    \u2131(z) = 0,   \u2131(z):= \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb( \n    [ (\u03bb I - A)(\u03bb I - A^\u22a4)-z I_n ] )/z^n\n\nand \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb stands for the \ndiscriminant of the polynomial treated with respect to \u03bb. In the framework of this approach we also provide the procedure for finding the nearest to A matrix with multiple eigenvalue. Generalization of the problem to the case of complex perturbations is also discussed. Several examples are presented clarifying the computational aspects of the approach.\n\n\n\n\nKeywords: Wilkinson's problem, defective matrix, multiple eigenvalues, distance equation\n\n\nMSC 2010: 68W30, 15A18 , 12D10, 58C40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe origin of the problem of finding the distance from a matrix A \u2208\u2102^n\u00d7 n\nto the set \ud835\udd3b of matrices with multiple eigenvalues can be traced back to Wilkinson\u00a0<cit.> who posed it in relation to the sensitivity analysis of matrix eigenvalues. The desired distance  further will be treated  with respect to either the 2-norm or to the Frobenius norm in \u2102^n\u00d7 n and will be \ndenoted d(A, \ud835\udd3b). It is usually referred to as the Wilkinson\ndistance of A <cit.>. Alternatively, \nd(A, \ud835\udd3b) can be defined as the \ninfA-B where B belongs to the subset of defective matrices, i.e. those possessing at least one eigenvalue \nwhose geometric multiplicity  is less than its algebraic multiplicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting from  Wilkinson's works\u00a0<cit.>, \nthe problem of evaluation of d(A, \ud835\udd3b) has been\nstudied intensively in\u00a0<cit.>. The most recent result is presented in the work\u00a0<cit.>. \nWe briefly trace the developed approaches. Most of them are in the framework of singular value analysis of appropriate parameter dependent matrices.\n\nThe following theorem gives the min-max representation of d(A,\ud835\udd3b) obtained by Malyshev\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n Let A\u2208\u2102^n\u00d7 n.\nLet the singular values of the matrix\n\n    [[ A-\u03bb I_n   \u03b3 I_n;  \ud835\udd46_n\u00d7 n A-\u03bb I_n ]]\n\nbe ordered like\n\u03c3_1(\u03bb,\u03b3)\u2265\u03c3_2(\u03bb,\u03b3)\u2265\u2026\u2265\u03c3_2n(\u03bb,\u03b3)\n\u2265 0. Then the  2-norm distance  d(A,\ud835\udd3b) can be evaluated as \n\n    d(A,\ud835\udd3b)=min_\u03bb\u2208\u2102max_\u03b3\u22650\u03c3_2n-1(\u03bb,\u03b3)  .\n\n\n\nThe straight computation of this distance is quite difficult, so to find this distance, in many works the notion of pseudospectra\u00a0<cit.> is used.\n\nDefinition. For both the 2-norm and the Frobenius norm, the \u03b5-pseudospectra of a matrix A\nis\n\n    \u039b_\u03b5(A)={\u03c3_min<\u03b5}\n\nwhere \u03b5>0 and \u03c3_min stands for the smallest\nsingular value of the matrix A-zI.\n\nEquivalently,\n\n    \u039b_\u03b5(A)={ z\u2208\u2102 | (A+E-zI)=0,  E\u2208\u2102^n\u00d7 nE <\u03b5}  .\n\nIf \u039b_\u03b5 has n components, then A+E has n\ndistinct eigenvalues for all perturbations\nE\u2208\u2102^n\u00d7 n and hence A+E is not defective.\n\nIn subsequent papers, the pseudospectra approach is used to find the distance to the nearest defective matrix. \n\nIn\u00a0<cit.>, a geometric solution to the problem of finding d(A,\ud835\udd3b) in Frobenius norm is given. The nearest defective\nmatrix is related to the critical points of \nthe minimal singular value \u03c3_min(x,y) of the matrix A-(x+\ud835\udc22 y)I that could\nbe obtained by examination of pseudospectra of A. For an\napproximation of a multiple eigenvalue of the nearest defective\nmatrix, the averaging heuristic by Puiseux series is proposed. Also\nan iterative method for finding this eigenvalue\ntogether with the minimal perturbation is presented.\n\nIn\u00a0<cit.>, it is proposed to find the smallest\nperturbation E such that the components of the pseudospectra of\nA+E coalesce. The problem is reformulated as follows. One needs to\nfind\nz\u2208\u2102,\u03b5\u2208\u211d,\u03b5>0 and U,V\u2208\u2102^n,such that[Hereinafter ^\u22a4 stands for the transpose while ^\ud835\udda7 stands for the Hermitian transpose.]\n\n    (A-zI)V-\u03b5 U=\ud835\udd46_n\u00d7 1,\u03b5 V-(A-zI)^\ud835\udda7 U=\ud835\udd46_n\u00d7 1,  U^\ud835\udda7 V=0   .\n\nThe algorithm to solve the system of equations presented in this\nwork is rather expensive because it requires the repeated\ncalculation of pseudospectra. Also any condition of coalescence of\ntwo pseudospectral curves is necessary.\n\nIn\u00a0<cit.>, a new computational approach to approximating the nearest defective matrix by a variant of Newton's method is  suggested. \n\nThe Implicit Determinant Method based on standard Newton's method\nis used to solve the system\u00a0(<ref>) in\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nThere are several works considering generalizations of Wilkinson's problem for the cases of prescribed eigenvalues or their  multiplicities \u00a0<cit.>,\n and matrix pencils\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nThe approaches developed in the above cited papers could be characterized as related to the Numerical Linear Algebra. The present paper aims at solving the stated problem for the case of Frobenius norm within the framework of symbolic computation approach. Namely, we reduce the problem to that of the univariate polynomial equation solving. As a matter of fact, the manifold \ud835\udd3b of  matrices with multiple eigenvalues in the \u211d^n^2 space of their entries is an algebraic one, i.e. it is represented by a multivariate polynomial equation. If we slightly modify  Wilkinson's problem to that of finding d^2(A,\ud835\udd3b), then the constrained optimization problem becomes an algebraic one in the sense that both the objective function and the constraint be polynomials.  Application of the Lagrange multipliers method reduces the problem to that of system of algebraic equations solving. The latter can be resolved, at least in theory, via the analytical procedure of elimination of variables consisting in the multivariate resultant computation or the Gr\u00f6bner basis construction. Application of these procedures to the system of equations of the treated problem, complemented with z-d^2(A,\ud835\udd3b)=0, results in a univariate equation \u2131(z)=0 whose zero set contains all the  critical values of the squared distance function. This equation will be further referred to as the distance equation and its computation is the priority of the present paper. \n\nThis approach has been developed in <cit.>.\nUnfortunately, soon after that publication, a significant gap in reasoning was discovered. It was assumed that the value d(A, \ud835\udd3b) could be provided by only the rank 1 perturbation matrix E_\u2217 and that the nearest to A matrix B_\u2217=A+E_\u2217 in \ud835\udd3b might possess only a double real eigenvalue.\nIn Section <ref>, an example of the order 4 matrix A is given where the nearest  in \ud835\udd3b  matrix\n  possesses a pair of double complex-conjugate eigenvalues. \nAs yet we failed to manage this scenario for the general statement of the problem; neither do we able to claim that it is a zero probability event. \n\nWe confine ourselves here to considering the case where the critical values of d^2(A,\ud835\udd3b) are provided only by the rank 1 perturbation matrices. For this case,  \nthe practical implementations of the elimination of variables procedure mentioned above  can be reduced to just only two bivariate equations. \nOne of these equations follows quite naturally from the developed in <cit.> approach. This is \n\n    \u03a6(\u03bb,z)=0   \u03a6(\u03bb,z):=\n    [ (\u03bb I - A)(\u03bb I - A^\u22a4)-z I_n ]\n       .\n\nThe more difficulties causes the deduction of the second equation. It happens to be \n    \u2202\u03a6(\u03bb,z)/ \u2202\u03bb =0   .\n\nTo obtain the distance equation, it is then sufficient to eliminate the variable \u03bb from the obtained system. This can be managed with the aid of discriminant computation, i.e. the function of the coefficients of a polynomial responsible for the existence of a multiple zero for this polynomial.\nWe recall some basic features of this function in Section <ref>.\n\nIn Section <ref>, we prove the main result of the paper, namely that the value d^2(A,\ud835\udd3b) is in the set of non-negative zeros of the distance equation. If A \u2209\ud835\udd3b then generically d^2(A,\ud835\udd3b) equals the least positive zero z_\u2217 of this equation. We also detail here the structure of the matrix B_\u2217 nearest  to A in \ud835\udd3b. It appears that the multiple eigenvalue of  B_\u2217 coincide with the multiple zero of the polynomial \u03a6(\u03bb,z_\u2217).\n\nIn Section <ref>, computational aspects of the proposed approach are discussed via solving the  problem for the two families of matrices treated in  the literature. \n\nIn Section <ref>, we address to the generalization of Wilkinson's problem to the case of complex perturbations. Here the results are presented in a very concise manner with the potential intention of returning to them in future articles.\n\nNotation is kept to correlate with <cit.>. For a matrix A \u2208\u211d^n\u00d7 n,\nf_A(\u03bb) denotes its characteristic polynomial,\n\nd(A, \ud835\udd3b) denotes the distance from A to the set \ud835\udd3b of matrices possessing a multiple eigenvalue.  E_\u2217 and B_\u2217 = A+ E_\u2217 stand for, respectively, the (minimal) perturbation matrix and the nearest to A  matrix in \ud835\udd3b (i.e. d(A,\ud835\udd3b)=A- B_\u2217); we then term by \u03bb_\u2217 the multiple eigenvalue of B_\u2217. I (or I_n) denotes the identity matrix (of the corresponding order). \ud835\udc9f (or \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb) denotes the discriminant of a polynomial (with subscript indicating the variable).\n\nRemark. All the computations were performed in CAS Maple 15.0 with those approximate done within the accuracy 10^-40. In the paper they are presented rounded to 10^-6.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ALGEBRAIC PRELIMINARIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is well-known that in the (N+1)-dimensional space of the polynomial \n\n    F(x)=a_0x^N + a_1x^N-1 +\u2026+a_N \u2208\u2102[x],   a_0 0, N \u2265 2\n\ncoefficients, the manifold of polynomials with multiple zeros \nis given by the equation\n\n    D(a_0,a_1,\u2026,a_N)=0    \n    D:=\ud835\udc9f_x(F(x))\n\ndenotes the discriminant of the polynomial. Discriminant is formally defined as a symmetric function of the zeros {\u03bb_1,\u2026, \u03bb_N } of the polynomial F(x)\n\n    D_x(F(x))= a_0^2N-2\u220f_1\u2264 j < k \u2264 N (\u03bb_k - \u03bb_j)^2   .\n\nThis representation gives rise to further transformation of the discriminant into the homogeneous polynomial D(a_0,a_1,\u2026,a_N) of the order 2N-2 with respect to the coefficients of F(x). Such a transformation  can be implemented through a preliminary representation of discriminant in an appropriate determinantal form. We will follow the approach based on the Hankel matrix formalism <cit.>.\n\n\nFor this aim, find first the Newton sums s_0,s_1,\u2026,s_2N-2 of the polynomial F(x) with the aid of recursive formulas\n\n    s_0=N, s_1=-a_1/a_0,\n\n\n    s_k={[ -(a_1s_k-1+a_2s_k-2+\u2026+a_k-1s_1+a_kk)/a_0,                                    k\u2264 N ,;      -(a_1s_k-1+a_2s_k-2+\u2026+a_Ns_k-N)/a_0,                                   k > N , ].\n\nand compose the Hankel matrix\n\n    S=[s_j+k]_j,k=0^N-1 =\n    [[    s_0    s_1    s_2      \u2026  s_N-2  s_N-1;    s_1    s_2    s_3      \u2026  s_N-1    s_N;    s_2    s_3    s_4      \u2026    s_N  s_N+1;      \u2026                    \u2026;  s_N-1    s_N  s_N+1      \u2026 s_2N-3 s_2N-2 ]]_N\u00d7 N .\n\nDenote by S_1,\u2026, S_N= S its leading principal minors.\n\n   One has\n\n    \ud835\udc9f(F)=a_0^2N-2 S_N   .\n\nThe condition \n\n    S_N=0, \u2026, S_N-k+1=0, S_N-k 0\n\nis the necessary and sufficient for the polynomial F(x) to possess k \ncommon zeros with F^' (x).\nIn particular, if S_N=0, S_N-1 0, then F(x) possesses a unique multiple zero and the multiplicity of this zero equals 2. This zero can be computed via the formula\n\n    \u03bb = \n    s_1-1/S_N-1|\n    [    s_0    s_1      \u2026  s_N-3  s_N-1;    s_1    s_2      \u2026  s_N-2    s_N;      \u22ee                           \u22ee;  s_N-2  s_N-1      \u2026 s_2N-1 s_2N-3 ]|    .\n\nThe determinant in the right-hand side is constructed by deleting the last row and the last but one column in \nS.\n\n\n\nConsequently, the set \ud835\udd3b of matrices with multiple eigenvalues is given by the equation\n\n    \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb( (\u03bb I-B) ) =0   .\n\n\nFor the case of polynomials with real coefficients, the sequence of leading principal minors of the matrix S permits one to establish the exact number of real zeros for F(x) <cit.>.\n\n Let \n\n    S_N=0, \u2026, S_N-k+1=0, S_N-k 0,\u2026,S_1  0\n\nThen the number of distinct pairs of complex-conjugate zeros for F(x) \u2208\u211d[x] equals\n\n    \ud835\udcb1(1,S_1,\u2026, S_N-k)\n\nwhere \ud835\udcb1 denotes the number of variations of sign in the given sequence.\n\n\nIn the space \u211d^N+1 of polynomials (<ref>) with real coefficients, the discriminant manifold (<ref>) separates the domains of vectors providing the coefficients of polynomials with the same number of real zeros. \n\nThe last comment of the present section relates to application of discriminant to one problem from Elimination Theory. Consider a bivariate polynomial F(x,y)\u2208\u211d[x,y],  F \u2265 2. The discriminant furnishes the tool for eliminating the variable x from the system of equations\n\n    F(x,y)=0, \u2202 F(x,y)/ \u2202 x=0   .\n    \n\nNamely, if (x_0,y_0) is a solution to the system (<ref>), then y_0  is necessarily a zero of the algebraic univariate equation\n\n    \ud835\udcb4(y)=0   \ud835\udcb4(y):=\ud835\udc9f_x(F(x,y))   .\n\nThe reverse statement is subject to an extra assumption. If y_1\u2208\u2102 is a zero for \ud835\udcb4(y), then there exists a multiple zero for the polynomial F(x,y_1).  Under the assumption that y_1 is a simple zero for \ud835\udcb4(y),\nx_1 is a  unique multiple zero and its  multiplicity equals 2. Then it can be expressed as a rational function of y_1  using the result of Theorem <ref>. These considerations are valid for all the solutions of the system (<ref>) provided that \ud835\udc9f_y(\ud835\udcb4(y)) 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISTANCE EQUATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of the discriminant manifold referred to in the previous section, the problem of evaluation of d^2 (A,\ud835\udd3b) is equivalent to that of constrained optimization\n\n    minB-A^2    \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb(f_B(\u03bb))=0, B\u2208\u211d^n\u00d7 n  .\n\nHere the constraint is an algebraic equation with respect to the entries of the matrix B.\nTraditional application of the Lagrange multipliers method reduces the problem to that of solving a system of n^2+1 nonlinear algebraic equations. Under the additional assumption the matrix B_\u2217\u2208\u211d^n\u00d7 n providing a solution to this system possesses only one multiple eigenvalue and its multiplicity equals 2, it is possible to  reduce the number of variables in the constrained optimization approach. The following result is presented in <cit.>:\n\n\n\nThe value d^2(A,\ud835\udd3b) belongs to the set of critical values of the objective function\n\n    G(U):=U^\u22a4A A^\u22a4 U - ( U^\u22a4AU )^2\n\nfor the constrained optimization problem under constraints \n\n    U^\u22a4U=1, U \u2208\u211d^n   .\n\nIf U_\u2217 be the point providing d^2(A,\ud835\udd3b), then the perturbation can be computed as\n\n    E_\u2217=U_\u2217 U_\u2217^\u22a4 (\u03ba I-A)    \u03ba:= U_\u2217^\u22a4 A U_\u2217  .\n\n\n\nThe new optimization problem still have significant number of variables. We aim to eliminate all of them but introduce an extra one responsible for the critical values of the objective function. \n\nStationary points of the function\n(<ref>) under the constraints\n(<ref>) can be found via Lagrange  method applied to the function G(U)- \u03bc (U^\u22a4U-1). This results into the system\n\n    AA^\u22a4U-(U^\u22a4 A U)(A+A^\u22a4)U-\u03bc U = \ud835\udd46_n\u00d7 1  .\n\nDenote\n\n    \u03bb:=U^\u22a4 A U   .\n\n Then the equation (<ref>) has a nontrivial solution with respect to  U if and only if\n \n    (AA^\u22a4-\u03bb (A+A^\u22a4)-\u03bc I)=0   .\n\n Under this condition, multiplication of \n  (<ref>) by U^\u22a4 yields\n \n    U^\u22a4AA^\u22a4U=2\u03bb^2+\u03bc  .\n\n Wherefrom it follows that the critical values of the objective function\n  (<ref>) are given by \n \n    z=\u03bb^2+\u03bc  .\n\n Substitution this into (<ref>) results in the equation connecting  z and \u03bb:\n\n    \u03a6(\u03bb,z)=0\n\n where\n\n    \u03a6(\u03bb,z):=\n    [ A A^\u22a4- \u03bb (A+A^\u22a4)+(\u03bb^2-z) I ]\n\n\n    =[ (\u03bb I - A)(\u03bb I - A)^\u22a4-z I ]\n\nZeros z_1,\u2026, z_n of the polynomial \u03a6(\u03bb,z)  with respect to the variable z are evidently real since they are the squares of the singular values for the matrix \u03bb I-A.\n\nOur further task is to deduce an extra equation connecting \n\u03bb and z.\n\n The value d^2(A,\ud835\udd3b) belongs to the set of non-negative zeros of \nthe polynomial\n\n    \u2131(z)\u2261\ud835\udc9f_\u03bb(\u03a6(\u03bb,z))/z^n   .\n\n\n\n\nProof. Under the condition (<ref>), there exists  a nontrivial solution  for (<ref>) with respect to the column  U\n\n    (\u03bb I-A)(\u03bb I-A)^\u22a4U=z  U    .\n\nThis equality means that U is the right \nsingular vector for the matrix \u03bb I - A corresponding to the singular value \u221a(z). The corresponding left singular vector for that matrix can be found from the equality\n\n    \u221a(z)V:=(\u03bb I - A)^\u22a4U   .\n\nDual relationship is valid for U:\n\n    \u221a(z)U=(\u03bb I - A)V   .\n\nFrom the conditions (<ref>) and (<ref>)\n\n\n\n\nit follows that\n\n    U^\u22a4(\u03bb I - A)U=0   .\n\nMultiply (<ref>) from the left by U^\u22a4. From (<ref>), it follows that\n\n    \u221a(z)=U^\u22a4(\u03bb I - A)V   .\n\nMultiply (<ref>) from the left by V^\u22a4 and utilize (<ref>):\n\n    \u221a(z)V^\u22a4V=V^\u22a4(\u03bb I - A)^\u22a4U=\u221a(z)  .\n\nWherefrom the two alternatives follow\n\n    V^\u22a4V=1     \u221a(z)=0   .\n\nSimilarly, multiplication of (<ref>) from the left by U^\u22a4 and further application of (<ref>) yields\n\n    \u221a(z)U^\u22a4V=0   .\n\nThis also leads to two alternatives:\n\n    U^\u22a4V=0     \u221a(z)=0   .\n\nIgnore the case \u221a(z)=0. \n\n    V^\u22a4V=1,  U^\u22a4V=0   .\n\nConsider the equation (<ref>) as a definition of the \u221a(z) as the function of \u03bb. Differentiate this relation with respect to \u03bb:\n\n    d \u221a(z)/d \u03bb=U^\u22a4V+d  U^\u22a4/d \u03bb (\u03bb I - A)V+U^\u22a4 \n    (\u03bb I - A)  d  V/d \u03bb  .\n\nWith the aid of (<ref>) and (<ref>) transform this into\n\n    U^\u22a4V+\u221a(z)[ d  U^\u22a4/d \u03bb U + V^\u22a4d  V/d \u03bb]   .\n\nDue to (<ref>) and (<ref>), we arrive at \n\n    d \u221a(z)/d \u03bb = 0   .\n\n\nEquation (<ref>) defines implicit function z(\u03bb). Differentiation of the identity \u03a6(\u03bb,z(\u03bb))\u2261 0 with respect to \u03bb yields the identity\n\n    \u03a6^'_\u03bb(\u03bb,z)+\u03a6^'_z(\u03bb,z) d  z/d \u03bb\u2261 0   .\n\nUnder the condition (<ref>), the variables \u03bb and z are linked by an extra relationship\n\n    \u03a6^'_\u03bb(\u03bb,z)=0   .\n\nTogether with (<ref>),  the deduced condition composes the system of algebraic equations\n\n    \u03a6 (\u03bb,z)=0, \u03a6^'_\u03bb(\u03bb,z)=0    .\n\nAccording with the results of Section <ref>, elimination of \u03bb from this system can be implemented with the aid of the discriminant computation, i.e. the variable z should  satisfy the equation\n\n    \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb (\u03a6 (\u03bb,z))=0   .\n\nTo prove the validity of (<ref>), it is necessary to additionally confirm that the left-hand side of the last equation is divisible by z^n. This is indeed the case, since the polynomial \u03a6(\u03bb,0) possesses n multiple zeros coinciding with the eigenvalues of the matrix A. \n\nWith \u2131(z) given by (<ref>), the distance equation \u2131(z) =0 is now well-defined and in Section <ref> we discuss some of related features and computational aspects. \n\nTo conclude the present section, we have to detail the properties of the \u03bb-component for the solution of the system (<ref>).\nLet the polynomial \u2131(z) defined by (<ref>) possess a positive real zero z_0 and this zero be simple. Then the polynomial \u03a6 (\u03bb,z_0) has a unique multiple zero and multiplicity of this zero equals 2. We denote by \u03bb_0. It is evidently real and can be expressed as a rational function of z_0 via, for instance, formula (<ref>). \n\nThe less evident conclusion is as follows: this multiple zero coincides with the multiple eigenvalue of the matrix in \ud835\udd3b providing the critical value z_0 for the function d^2(A,\ud835\udd3b). \n\n\n \nFor any real solution (\u03bb_0,z_0) of the system\u00a0(<ref>)  where\nz_0 0, there exists the rank 1 perturbation E_0 such that \nE_0=\u221a(z_0) and the matrix B_0=A+E_0 possesses the multiple eigenvalue \n\u03bb_0.\n\n\nProof. The number \u221a(z_0) is a singular value  for the matrix \u03bb_0 I - A. We intend to prove that the matrix from the theorem statement is defined by the formula\n\n    E_0:=\u221a(z_0)U_0 V_0^\u22a4  ,\n\nwhere U_0 and V_0 are respectively the left and the right singular vectors of the unit norm for the matrix\n \u03bb_0 I-A corresponding to \u221a(z_0).\n\nIndeed, the matrix B_0=A+E_0  has \u03bb_0 as the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector V_0: \n\n    B_0V_0=(A+E_0)V_0 \n    (<ref>)= \n    AV_0+\u221a(z_0)U_0\n    (<ref>)\n    =AV_0+(\u03bb_0I-A)V_0=\u03bb_0V_0   .\n\nIf (B_0-\u03bb_0 I)<n-1 then the theorem is proved. Assume that (B_0-\u03bb_0 I)=n-1. Let us prove the existence of a column W such  that\n\n    (B_0-\u03bb_0 I)W=V_0   .\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for resolving this equation consists in the fulfillment of the equality\n\n    (B_0-\u03bb_0I)(B-\u03bb_0I)^+V_0=V_0\n\nwhere ^+ stands for the Moore-Penrose inverse of the matrix. It can be easily verified that\n\n    (B_0-\u03bb_0I)(B_0-\u03bb_0I)^+=I-U_0U_0^\u22a4\n\n(by assumption, (B_0-\u03bb_0 I)=n-1), and the condition (<ref>) is fulfilled:\n\n    (B_0-\u03bb_0I)(B_0-\u03bb_0I)^+V_0=\n    (I-U_0U_0^\u22a4)V_0\n    (<ref>)=\n    V_0   .\n\n\nThe columns V_0 and W are linearly independent. \nIndeed, if\n\n    \u03b1 V_0+ \u03b2 W=\ud835\udd46_n \u00d7 1   {\u03b1, \u03b2}\u2282\u211d\n\nthen on multiplying this equality from the left by\nB_0-\u03bb_0 I it follows that\n \u03b2 V_0 = \ud835\udd46_n \u00d7 1, and thus \u03b2=0. But then \u03b1=0 since V_0 is a nonzero column. \n \nHence, \n \n    (B_0-\u03bb_0I)^2V_0=  \ud835\udd46,  (B_0-\u03bb_0I)^2W=  \ud835\udd46\n\n for the linear independent V_0 and W. Consequently,\n (B_0-\u03bb_0 I)^2\u2264 n-2 and this gives evidence that \u03bb_0 should be a multiple eigenvalue for B_0. \nIf A \u2209\ud835\udd3b,  then\n\n    d(A,\ud835\udd3b) = \u221a(z_\u2217)  ,\n\nwhere z_\u2217 is the minimal positive zero of the polynomial (<ref>) provided that this zero is not a multiple one. Minimal perturbation is evaluated by the formula\n\n    E_\u2217=U_\u2217U_\u2217^\u22a4 (\u03bb_\u2217I-A)   .\n\nHere \u03bb_\u2217 is the multiple zero for the polynomial \u03a6(\u03bb,z_\u2217) and U_\u2217\u2208\u211d^n, U_\u2217=1 is the left singular vector of the matrix \u03bb_\u2217I-A corresponding to the singular value \u221a(z_\u2217).\n\n\nThe significance of condition for simplicity of the minimal positive zero z_\u2217 can be explained as follows. Since we are looking for only real perturbations, formula (<ref>) yields such a matrix if \u03bb_\u2217 is real. For the matrices of the order n\u2265 4, it might happen that the system (<ref>) possesses a solution (z_\u2217, \u03bb_\u2217) with an imaginary \u03bb_\u2217 (we give an example of such a matrix in Section <ref>). Then the system necessarily possesses the solution (z_\u2217,\u03bb_\u2217). This implies (v. the last comment from Section <ref>) that  z_\u2217 should be a multiple zero for (<ref>). Therefore, the condition for simplicity of z_\u2217is sufficient to prevent such an occasion. Formal verification of this condition can be replaced by a more general one relating the discriminant of \u2131(z): \n\n    \ud835\udc9f_z(\u2131(z)) 0   .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PROPERTIES OF THE DISTANCE EQUATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The distance equation for the matrix A=[a_jk ]_j,k=1^2 is found in the form\n\n    \u2131(z):=16[ (a_11-a_22)^2+(a_12+a_21)^2 ]\u00b7{[4z- \ud835\udc9f (f_A(\u03bb)) ]^2-16(a_12-a_21)^2z }=0  .\n\nPolynomial in braces has only real zeros with respect to z since its discriminant equals\n\n    256(a_12-a_21)^2[(a_11-a_22)^2+ (a_12+a_21)^2 ] \u2265 0   .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome terms in the canonical representation of the polynomial (<ref>) can be explicitly expressed via the entries of the matrix A:\n\n    \u03a6(\u03bb,z)\u2261\u03bb^2n- 2 (A) \u03bb^2n-1 +(-nz+ (AA^\u22a4)+p_2  )  \u03bb^2n-2 +\u2026 +\n    (AA^\u22a4-zI)   .\n\nHere p_2 is the coefficient of \u03bb^n-2 in the characteristic polynomial  f_A + A^\u22a4(\u03bb):= (\u03bb I - A-A^\u22a4). It happens that this polynomial is also responsible for the order of the distance equation.\n\n  One has \n\n    \u2131(z)\u2261 4^n [ \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb (f_A+A^\u22a4(\u03bb)) ]^2 z^n(n-1) +  z   .\n    \n\n\nProof. Let {\u03bc_1,\u2026, \u03bc_n } be the spectrum of the matrix A+A^\u22a4 while P\u2208\u211d^n\u00d7 n be an orthogonal matrix reducing it to the diagonal form: \n\n    P^\u22a4(A+A^\u22a4) P=  (\u03bc_1,\u2026, \u03bc_n)    .\n\nApply the same transformation to the determinant (<ref>):\n\n    \u03a6(\u03bb,z) \u2261[\n    P^\u22a4AA^\u22a4P +  (\u03bb^2-\u03bc_1 \u03bb-z,\u2026,\n    \u03bb^2-\u03bc_n \u03bb-z)   .\n    ]\n\nThe leading term  of the polynomial \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb (\u03a6(\u03bb,z)) with respect to z coincide with that of \n\n    \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb(\u220f_j=1^n (\u03bb^2-\u03bc_j \u03bb-z))   .\n\nThe set of zeros of the polynomial under the discriminant sign is as follows\n\n    {1/2(\u03bc_j \u00b1\u221a(\u03bc_j^2+4z)) }_j=1^n   .\n\nUsing the definition (<ref>) of the discriminant, one gets \n\n    \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb(\u220f_j=1^n (\u03bb^2-\u03bc_j \u03bb-z)) = \n    \u220f_j=1^n (4 z + \u03bc_j^2) \n    \u220f_1\u2264 j < k \u2264 n[ z^2 (\u03bc_k-\u03bc_j)^4]   .\n\nCoefficient of the monomial z^n^2 in the right-hand side can be recognized, via (<ref>),  as the square of the  discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of A+ A^\u22a4. \n\nAs for the determining the structure of the free term of \u2131(z), our successes are restricted to the following \n\nHypothesis. If computed symbolically with respect to  the entries of A, \u2131(0) has a factor [\ud835\udc9f_\u03bb (f_A(\u03bb)) ]^2.\n\nAccording to Theorem <ref>, the polynomial \u2131(z) can be constructed in the form of determinant of a suitable Hankel matrix.\nFor this aim, compute first the Newton sums {s_j(z)}_j=0^4n-2 for  the polynomial \u03a6(\u03bb,z) treated with respect to \u03bb. Direct utilization of the formulas (<ref>) requires the canonical representation (<ref>) for the polynomial \u03a6(\u03bb,z) while initially we have just only its representation in the determinantal form (<ref>). Fortunately, the Newton sums can be computed in an alternative way. \nIndeed, \n\n    \u03a6(\u03bb,z) \u2261 (\u03bb I_2n- W)    \n    W:=[ [      A^\u22a4 \u221a(z) I_n; \u221a(z) I_n        A ]]\n\nand it is known that the Newton sums of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix can be computed as the traces of matrix powers:\n\n    s_j(z) \u2261(W^j)    j \u2208{0,1,\u2026}\n\nThus, one has\n\n    s_2(z)=2 ((A^2)+nz), s_3(z)=2((A^3)+3  z (A)), \u2026\n\nCompose the Hankel matrix\n\n    S(z):=[ s_j+k(z) ]_j,k=0^2n-1\n\nand compute the sequence of its leading principal minors S_1(z),\u2026,S_2n(z). Due to \n(<ref>) and (<ref>),  \n\n    S_2n(z)\u2261\ud835\udc9f_\u03bb(\u03a6(\u03bb,z))\u2261\u2131(z) z^n   .\n\nEvidently, the polynomial \u03a6(\u03bb,0) possesses only n double zeros, and they all are distinct provided that A \u2209\ud835\udd3b. Consequently, due to Theorem <ref>, one  has\nS_n+1(0)=0,\u2026, S_2n(0)=0.\n\n\n Polynomial \u2131(z) does not have negative zeros.\nThe number of its positive zeros lying within the interval\n[0,z_0], z_0>0 is not less than \n\n    | \ud835\udcb1(1,S_1(z_0),\u2026,S_2n(z_0)) - \ud835\udcb1(1,S_1(0),\u2026,S_n(0)) |   .\n \n\n\n\n\nProof. The first claim of the theorem follows from the positive definiteness of the matrix (\u03bb I - A)(\u03bb I - A)^\u22a4-z I for z< 0.\n\nBy Theorem <ref>, the number \ud835\udcb1(1,S_1(z_0),\u2026,S_2n(z_0)) equals the number of complex-conjugate pairs of zeros for the polynomial \u03a6(\u03bb,z_0). When the parameter z varies from 0 to z_0, the discriminant \ud835\udc9f_\u03bb (\u03a6(\u03bb,z)) vanishes at any value of z where a pair of real zeros of \u03a6(\u03bb,z) transforms to a pair complex-conjugate ones or vice versa. The discriminant vanishes at these values. \n\nTheorem <ref> claims that the degree of the distance equation generically equals n(n-1). One can immediately watch that for the skew-symmetric matrix A this estimation is not valid. Moreover, for this type of matrices, polynomial \u2131(z) vanishes identically. Some other types of matrices that permit explicit representation  \nfor the polynomial \u03a6(\u03bb,z), and, as a consequence, for the value d(A, \ud835\udd3b), in terms of the spectrum of A can be found in <cit.>. We summarize those results in the following \n\n  Let all the eigenvalues \u03bb_1,\u2026,\u03bb_n of A be distinct. One has:\n\n    \u03a6(\u03bb,z)\u2261\u220f_j=1^n [(\u03bb-c)^2-(\u03bb_j-c)^2-z]    A= + cI_n  ,\n\nwhere c \u2208\u211d is an arbitrary scalar;\n\n    \u03a6(\u03bb,z)\u2261\u220f_j=1^n (\u03bb^2-z+1-2\u03bb(\u03bb_j))    A   ;\n\n\n    \u03a6(\u03bb,z)\u2261\u220f_j=1^n [(\u03bb-\u03bb_j)^2-z ]     A  .\n\n  \n  \nFor the case (<ref>), \u03a6(\u03bb,z) has a multiple zero if n\u2265 2. For the case (<ref>), \n \u03a6(\u03bb,z) has a multiple zero if n\u2265 3. For the both cases, the distance d(A, \ud835\udd3b) is attained at the continuum of matrices in \ud835\udd3b <cit.>.\n \n Find d(A,\ud835\udd3b) for the skew-symmetric matrix\n\n    A=[ [   0  -4   2  -1;   4   0   7   3;  -2  -7   0  11;   1  -3 -11   0 ]]   .\n\n\n\nSolution.

For this case, an extra difficulty results from approximation of the entries of the matrix K_n as rational numbers. This results in increasing the length of the coefficients of the distance equation.

We need to find just only  the least positive zero of \u2131(z). For this aim, the determinantal representation (<ref>) for this polynomial might be sufficient for the real zero localization. According to Theorem <ref>, the lower estimate for the number of real zeros of \u2131(z) lying within the interval [0,z_0], z_0 >0 is given by the number (<ref>). If this number is not zero then at least one real zero for \u2131(z) lies in [0,z_0], and the next step in its localization might be the treatment of the matrix  S(z_0/2). \n\nExperiments with the Frank's matrix (<ref>) demonstrate \nthe unambiguity of the zero isolation process. For the matrix F_10, one has\n\ud835\udcb1(1,S_1(0),\u2026,S_10(0))=0, i.e. all the eigenvalues of A are real. Then (<ref>) coincides with \n\n    \ud835\udcb1_z_0:= \ud835\udcb1(1,S_1(z_0),\u2026,S_10(z_0),\u2026, S_20(z_0))   .\n\nSome specializations for z_0\n\n\n\nz_0      10^-3       10^-9     2\u00d7 10^-15\n    10^-15 \n\n\ud835\udcb1_z_0     5      3     1     0 \n\n\n\ndemonstrate that the number of real zeros of \u2131(z) lying in any interval [0,z_0] happens to be equal to \ud835\udcb1_z_0.

Zero z_4 is simple, it coincides with the square of a singular value of the matrix A, and the polynomial \u03a6(\u03bb,z_4) has the real double zero \u03bb_4=0.

Also z_2 >z_1, therefore, the two zeros that can compete for the distance value are z_1 and z_4.

The present section should be considered as a draft of a separate publication to be prepared sometime afterwards. We skip here the details of algebraic backgrounds, proofs of theoretical results and do not bother ourselves with mentioning that the validity of some of the declared results is subject to several extra assumptions preventing the appearance of  \ntroubles similar to those dealt with in the previous section.\n\nConsider the polynomial\n\n    \u0398(a,b,z)=[((a+b \ud835\udc22)I-A)((a-b\ud835\udc22)I-A^\u22a4)-zI]\n\nand generate the system of algebraic equations\n\n    \u0398=0, \u2202\u0398 /\u2202\n    a =0,  \u2202\u0398/ \u2202 b=0   .\n\nWe are looking for the real solutions to this system.\nSince \n\n    \u0398(a,0,z)  (<ref>)\u2261\u03a6(a,z)   ,\n \nthis solution set includes that for the system (<ref>).\n\n\n  If the system (<ref>) possesses a solution (a_0,b_0,z_0) with b_0 0 then it has the solution \n(a_0,-b_0,z_0).\n\n\nProof. \nPolynomial \u0398(a,b,z) is even in b:\n\n    \u0398(a,-b,z)=[ ((a+\ud835\udc22 b)I-A^\u22a4)((a-\ud835\udc22 b)I-A) - zI ]\n\n\n    =[ {((a+\ud835\udc22 b)I-A^\u22a4)((a-\ud835\udc22 b)I-A)}^\u22a4 - zI ]\n\n\n    =[((a-\ud835\udc22 b)I-A^\u22a4) ((a+\ud835\udc22 b)I-A)  - zI ]=\u0398(a,b,z)   .\n\nConsequently \u0398^'_a is even in b while \u0398^'_b  is odd b. The latter becomes even on dividing by b. \n\nOur aim is to eliminate the variables a and b from the system (<ref>), i.e. to find the bivariate discriminant \n\ud835\udc9f_a,b(\u0398) for the polynomial \u0398(a,b,z) treated with respect to these variables. \n\nThe discriminant \ud835\udc9f_x,y(F)  of a polynomial F(x,y,z) \u2208\u2102[x,y,z] is formally defined as the result of elimination of variables x and y from the system of equations\n\n    F=0, \u2202 F / \u2202 x=0,  \u2202 F / \u2202 y=0   .\n\nThis is a polynomial in z and its vanishment at z=z_0 \u2208\u2102 is the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of solution (x_0,y_0,z_0) \u2208\u2102^3 to the system (<ref>), or equivalently, for the existence of the multiple zero (x_0,y_0) for the polynomial F(x,y,z_0). Constructive computation of discriminant \ncan be implemented in several ways, and we will exemplify below the procedure based of the B\u00e9zout construction of the resultant <cit.>.\n\n\n The discriminant \ud835\udc9f_a,b(\u0398(a,b,z))  is factorized as follows:\n\n    \ud835\udc9f_a,b(\u0398(a,b,z))\u2261 z^n(n+1)/2\u2131(z) \u2131(z)     .\n\nHere  \u2131(z) is defined by (<ref>), while \n\n    \u2131(z) \u2208\u211d[z],  \u2131(z) =n(n-1)(n-2)/2   ,\n\n(For n=2 polynomial \u2131(z) is just a constant).\n\n\nAccording to Section <ref>, the distance equation \u2131(z)=0 is responsible for the rank 1 real perturbation that provides the distance d(A,\ud835\udd3b).\nIt turns out that the equation\n\n    \u2131(z) = 0\n \n is responsible for the rank 1 imaginary perturbation. Its real zero z_0 corresponds to a pair of multiple zeros \nof the polynomial \u0398(a,b, z_0), and these zeros are either in the form  (a_0, \u00b1\u03b2_0) or in the form\n(a_0, \u00b1\ud835\udc22\u03b2_0) with real \u03b2_0. We are definitely interested only in the real solutions for the \nsystem (<ref>).\n\n\n\n\n\n Let the system (<ref>) possess a real solution (a_0,b_0,z_0) with z_0 >0,b_0 0.\nDenote U_0\u2208\u2102^n,  U_0=1 the left singular vector for the matrix \n(a_0+\ud835\udc22 b_0)I-A corresponding to the singular value \n\u221a(z_0).\nThen  the rank 1 perturbation\n\n    E_0=U_0 U_0^\ud835\udda7 ((a_0+\ud835\udc22 b_0) I-A)\n\nis such that E_0= \u221a(z_0) and the matrix B_0=A+E_0 \u2208\u2102^n\u00d7 n possesses the double eigenvalue a_0+\ud835\udc22 b_0.\n\n\nRemark. Evidently, the matrix E_0 provides for the matrix \nB_0=A+E_0 the double\neigenvalue a_0-\ud835\udc22 b_0.\n\nIn view of Theorem <ref>, the distance d_C(A,\ud835\udd3b) results from the competition between the least positive zero of \u2131(z) and that minimal positive zero of \n\u2131(z) that corresponds to the real solution for the system (<ref>).\n\n\nComputation of the polynomial \u2131(z) can be simplified if we take into account Theorem <ref>. Substitute \n\n    \ud835\udd1f:=b^2\n \nin the polynomials of the system (<ref>) and denote\n\n    \u039e(a,\ud835\udd1f,z):=\u0398(a,b,z),  \u039e_a(a,\ud835\udd1f,z):=\u0398^'_a(a,b,z),  \u039e_\ud835\udd1f(a,\ud835\udd1f,z):=\u0398^'_b(a,b,z)/b    .\n\n\n The result of elimination of variables a and \ud835\udd1f from the system\n\n    \u039e=0, \u039e_a=0, \u039e_\ud835\udd1f=0\n\nis the equation \n\n    z^n(n-1)/2\u2131(z)=0   .\n\n\n\nIf z_0 is a positive zero of \u2131(z), the corresponding real solution to the system (<ref>) might have the \ud835\udd1f-component either positive or negative. We are interested only in the positive variant.\n\n Find d_C(A,\ud835\udd3b) for\n\n    A= [ [   0   1   0;   0   0   1; -91 -55 -13 ]]   .\n\n\n\nSolution. First compute the polynomial  \u2131(z) via (<ref>):\n\n    \u2131(z) := 33076090700402342058246544 z^6-377039198861306289080145178864  z^5\n\n\n    +937864902703881321034450183916 z^4-771868276098720970149792503999 z^3\n\n\n    +211070978787821517684022650624 z^2\n\n\n    -510584100140452518540394496 z+319295875259784560640000   .\n\nIts real zeros  are as follows\n\n    z_1\u2248 0.739336,  0.765571, 0.980468,  11396.658548   .\n\nNext compose the polynomial \u039e(a,\ud835\udd1f,z):\n\n    \u039e(a,\ud835\udd1f,z)=-z^3+(3a^2+3\ud835\udd1f+26a+11477)z^2\n\n\n    -(3 a^4+6 a^2\ud835\udd1f+3 \ud835\udd1f^2+52a^3+52a\ud835\udd1f+11756a^2+11536\ud835\udd1f+11466 a+19757)z\n\n\n    +( a^2+\ud835\udd1f+14 a+49 )  ( (a^2+\ud835\udd1f+6 a+13)^2-\n    16 \ud835\udd1f)   .\n\nNow we trace briefly the procedure  of elimination of a and \ud835\udd1f from the system (<ref>). Consider the monomial sequence\n\n    \ud835\udd44:={\ud835\udd2a_j(a,\ud835\udd1f)}={1,a,\ud835\udd1f, \ud835\udd1f^2}  .\n\nIt is possible to reduce the polynomial \ud835\udd2a_j  \u039e modulo \u039e_a and \u039e_\ud835\udd1f, i.e. to \nfind the polynomials {\u03b2_jk(z) }_j,k=1^4 \u2282\u211d[z] and {p_11(a,\ud835\udd1f,z), p_j2(a,\ud835\udd1f,z)}_j=1^4 \u2282\u211d[a,\ud835\udd1f,z] satisfying the identity\n\n    m_j  \u039e\u2261\u03b2_j1(z)+ \u03b2_j2(z) a + \u03b2_j3(z) \ud835\udd1f + \u03b2_j4(z) \ud835\udd1f^2 +  p_j1\u039e_a  + p_j2\u039e_\ud835\udd1f  j\u2208{1,2,3,4}  .\n\nFor instance, \n\n    \u03b2_11(z)= -17718805921 z^2+610367232 z+22937600,  \u03b2_12(z)= -39353600  z+5324800,\n\n\n    \u03b2_13(z)=146694400 z-512000, \u03b2_14(z)=-307200, \u2026,\n\n\n    \u03b2_44(z)=\n    - 76550493273549926400 z^3+ 162810741053705011200 z^2- 1867736871075840000 z- 50331648000000  .\n\nCompose the B\u00e9zout matrix \n\n    \ud835\udd05(z):= [ \u03b2_jk(z) ]_j,k=1^4   .\n\nThen\n\n    \ud835\udd05(z) \u2261  z^3\u2131(z)\n\nwhere\n\n    \u2131(z) =  412324266119803814719539025 z^3+\n    33923334498676415590177600 z^2\n\n\n    +691077589890510378371072 z-\n    899669298077697638400   .\n\nFor any zero z_0 of this polynomial, the corresponding a  and \ud835\udd1f components of the solution to the system (<ref>) can be obtained in the following way.

The proposed approach consists in the construction of distance equation with the zero set containing the critical values of the squared distance function. This construction is realized in the ideology of symbolic computations, i.e. the procedure consists of a finite number of elementary algebraic operations on the entries of the matrix. \n\nThe representation of the distance equation with the aid of the discriminant function should not be taken as a complete surprise. Indeed, the Wilkinson's  problem is the one of evaluation the distance to the discriminant manifold in the space of matrix entries. Hence, in view of this circumstance, the appearance of the discriminant in a solution to the problem is somehow natural. The more astonishing is the emergence of the discriminant in nearly any problem of distance evaluation from a point to an algebraic manifold in a multidimensional space <cit.>.\n\n\nDirection for further research is clearly related the stuff of Section <ref>, i.e. the problem of existence the rank 2 minimal perturbation providing d(A,\ud835\udd3b). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n99\n\n\nAhmadAlam Ahmad, Sk.S., Alam, R.: On Wilkinson's problem for matrix pencils.
