Benavidez^1,4 \n    March 30, 2023\n==========================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\nWe study reductions and rational solutions of the full Kostant-Toda (f-KT) hierarchy in the Hessenberg form in this paper. \n\nIn the last fifty years, there have been several publications (c.f. <cit.>) which studied the classical tri-diagonal Toda lattice and the full Kostant-Toda lattice on the semisimple Lie algebra \ud835\udd24=\ud835\udd2b_-\u2295\ud835\udd1f_+ in the standard notation (c.f. <cit.>). These sytems can be viewed as Toda flows on the minimal and maximal symplectic leaves inside the dual space \ud835\udd1f_+^*, respectively (c.f. <cit.>). It is natural to investigate the Toda flows on all the other symplectic leaves,  however intermediate Toda lattices which sit between the tri-diagonal Toda lattice and the full Kostant-Toda lattice were rarely mentioned in the literature (c.f. <cit.>). One of the main goals in this paper is to give a clean characterization for the special intermediate Toda lattices possessing the banded structures in the Hessenberg form based on a root space decomposition <cit.>. The geometry of the Hessenberg matrices however naturally leads to a further motivation for the current project which we now explain. \n\nLet \ud835\uddb7 be a linear map \ud835\uddb7: \u2102^M \u2192\u2102^M and h: {1, 2, \u2026, M}\u2192{1, 2, \u2026, M} a non-decreasing function satisfying h(i) \u2265 i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 M. The Hessenberg variety associated to X and h is defined as\n\n    Hess(\ud835\uddb7, h) := {V_\u2219\u2208 Fl(\u2102^M)  | \ud835\uddb7V_i \u2286 V_h(i) for all  1 \u2264 i \u2264 M},\n\nwhere Fl(\u2102^M) is the complete flag variety of \u2102^M consisting of sequences V_\u2219 = (V_1 \u2282 V_2 \u2282\u22ef\u2282 V_M = \u2102^M) of the linear subspaces of \u2102^M with dim V_i = i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 M. The following two examples of Hessenberg varieties are especially relevant here. Consider the linear map on \u2102^M associated with the regular nilpotent matrix\n\n    \ud835\uddad = [ 0 1      ;   0 1    ;     \u22f1 \u22f1  ;       0 1;         0 ].\n\nFor h = (M, M, \u2026, M), Hess(\ud835\uddad, h) is the flag variety Fl(\u2102^M) itself, and for h = (2, 3, 4, \u2026, M, M), Hess(\ud835\uddad, h) is the so-called Peterson variety. These two varieties are associated with the maximal and minimal Hessenberg functions respectively (c.f. <cit.> and the reference therein for more information on the Hessenberg varieties). \n\nPutting the stories of f-KT hierarchy and Hessenberg varieties side by side, it is hard to believe that these beautiful things are not related in a deep and essential way. Indeed, another way to define the Peterson variety is as follows (c.f. <cit.>). Let SL_M(\u2102)^\ud835\uddad be the centralizer of \ud835\uddad in SL_M(\u2102) where \ud835\uddad is the nilpotent matrix defined in (<ref>), then Peterson variety is the following M-1 dimensional subvariety of the flag variety\n\n    SL_M(\u2102)^\ud835\uddad\u00b7\ud835\udd1f_-\u2282 SL_M(\u2102) \u212c^-,\n\nwhere \u212c^- is the Borel subgroup of lower triangular matrices and \ud835\udd1f_-=Lie(\u212c^-).\nIt may be easy to recognize from this definition that Peterson variety consists of exactly those points in the flag variety which parameterize rational solutions of the tri-diagonal Toda hierarchy (c.f. <cit.> and below). This correspondence can actually be used to study geometry of the Peterson variety. As an example we note that in <cit.> (Theorem 2.5) Flaschka and Haine essentially proved in the Toda lattice setting that the Peterson variety intersects with Bruhat cells corresponding to the longest Weyl group elements generated by the reflections with respect to the hyperplanes orthogonal to a subset of simple roots, and this fact was only proved later in the Hessenberg variety setting by Harada and Tymoczko in <cit.> (Proposition 5.8).\n\nAs we also proved in <cit.> that there is a one-to-one correspondence between rational solutions of the f-KT hierarchy and points in the corresponding flag variety,  it is natural to anticipate a more precise correspondence between sub-hierarchies of the f-KT hierarchy and sub-Hessenberg varieties of the flag variety and to use results from one side to gain insights on the other. Such initial attempts had already been made in <cit.>, and our humble goal in this paper is to push the story on the f-KT hierarchy side a little bit by studying solutions of the banded f-KT hierarchy while leaving the investigation of the precise correspondence in a future publication.\n\nThe f-KT hierarchy can be defined on any semisimple Lie algebra (c.f. <cit.>) and an immediate reason for our restriction to the Hessenberg form Lax matrix (which includes Lie algebras of type A, B, C, G etc.)\n\n    L = \u2211_i=1^M-1E_i,i+1+\u2211_1\u2264 j\u2264 i\u2264 Ma_i,j()E_i,j\n\nis that all the matrix elements a_i, j() can be neatly expressed in terms of \u03c4-functions where = (t_1, t_2, \u2026). Let \u0394_N() denote the N-th leading principal minor of the matrix exp(\u0398_L()()),\n\n    \u0394_N():=[exp(\u0398_L()()))]_N    for   N=1,2,\u2026,M,\n\nwhere \u0398_L()() := \u2211_n = 1^\u221e(L())^nt_n. Then we have the following proposition (Proposition <ref>):\n\n\nThe elements a_i,j() for the f-KT hierarchy can be expressed as\n\n    a_i,j()=p_i-j+1(D\u0303)\u0394_j()\u2218\u0394_i-1()/\u0394_j()\u0394_i-1()    for   1\u2264 j\u2264 i\u2264 M,\n\nwhere D\u0303 is defined by\n\n    D\u0303:=(D_1, 1/2D_2, 1/3D_3,\u2026 )    with     \n    D_nf\u2218 g=(\u2202/\u2202 t_n-\u2202/\u2202 t'_n)f()g(')|_='.\n\n\nIn particular, we have\n\n    a_N,N()=\u2202/\u2202 t_1ln\u0394_N()/\u0394_N-1(),      1 \u2264 N \u2264 M.\n\nFor f-KT hierarchy defined on semisimple Lie algebras, the matrix elements can actually all be expressed as polynomials in a_N, N's and their derivatives, and thus in terms of \u03c4-functions (Proposition <ref>), but in general we do not have a clean formula like (<ref>).\nThe formula (<ref>) was derived in <cit.> for the discrete KP hierarchy in terms of the vertex operator formalism and we give an elementary proof in Appendix A for the f-KT hierarchy based on the iso-spectral deformation method <cit.>. \n\nThe \u2113-banded Kostant-Toda (\u2113-KT) hierarchy is the f-KT hierarchy constrained by the condition that the subdiagonals of the Lax matrix L lower than the \u2113-th diagonal are all zero. This condition is consistent with the Toda flows in the sense that if the initial condition L() is \u2113-banded, then it stays \u2113-banded for all  under the Toda flows. Note that for the \u2113-KT hierarchy the elements on the \u2113-th diagonal can be directly integrated (Proposition <ref>):\n\nThe elements a_i,j in the \u2113-th diagonal of the \u2113-KT hierarchy are given by\n\n    a_k+\u2113, k()=a_k+\u2113,k^0\u0394_k+\u2113()\u0394_k-1()/\u0394_k+\u2113-1()\u0394_k()    for   1\u2264 k\u2264 M-\u2113,\n\nwhere a_k+\u2113,k^0 is a constant.\n\nComparing (<ref>) with (<ref>), we obtain the first characterization of the \u2113-KT hierarchy in terms of the bilinear relations,\n\n    p_\u2113+1(D\u0303)\u0394_k\u2218\u0394_k+\u2113-1()=a_k+\u2113,k^0\u0394_k+\u2113()\u0394_k-1()    for   1\u2264 k\u2264 M-\u2113.\n\n\nWhen \u2113=1, we recover the bilinear equation for the original tridiagonal Toda lattice (1-KT lattice),\n\n    p_2(D\u0303)\u0394_k\u2218\u0394_k=1/2D_1^2\u0394_k\u2218\u0394_k=\u0394_k\u2202_1^2\u0394_k-(\u2202_1\u0394_k)^2=a_k+1,k^0\u0394_k+1\u0394_k-1.\n\n\nOur second characterization of the \u2113-KT hierarchy is in terms of the singular structure of their solutions, that is which Bruhat cells the complex solutions might hit. Note that when the Toda flows become singular and hit the boundary of a Schubert cell at time _*, then we have\n\n    exp(\u0398_L(0)(_*))=n_*\u1e87_*b_*    for some   w_*\u2208S_M,\n\nwhere n_*\u2208\ud835\udca9^-, b_*\u2208\u212c^+ and \u1e87_* \u2208 GL_M is a representative of w_* \u2208S_M, the symmetric group of order M. Set \u2192+_*, we have the following expansion of \u03c4-functions near _* (Theorem <ref>):\n\nThe \u03c4-function \u0394_N(; w_*) has the  Schur expansion,\n\n    \u0394_N(; w_*)=S_\u03bb()+\u2211_\u03bc\u2283\u03bbc_\u03bcS_\u03bc(),\n\nwhere S_\u03bb(t) is the Schur polynomial associated with the Young diagram \u03bb, which\nis determined by w_* as follows: Let {i_1,i_2,\u2026,i_N} be defined by\n\n    {i_1,i_2,\u2026,i_N}={w_*(1),w_*(2),\u2026, w_*(N)},\n\nwith i_1<i_2<\u22ef<i_N. Then the Young diagram \u03bb=(\u03bb_1,\u03bb_2,\u2026,\u03bb_N) is given by\n\n    \u03bb_k=i_k-k    for     1\u2264 k\u2264 N.\n\n\n\nOur second characterization constraints which Bruhat cells solutions of the \u2113-KT hierarchy may hit, equivalently Theorem <ref> in the following shows how the corresponding symplectic leaves for the \u2113-KT hierarchy may be compactified in the flag variety (Proposition <ref>):\n\nLet w_* be an element in S_M satisfying the following conditions,\n\n\n  (a)\nw_*(i) w_*(i+k)+1  for any  k > \u2113, and\n\n  (b) for some 1\u2264 i\u2264 M-\u2113, there is a relation,\n\n    w_*(i)=w_*(i+\u2113)+1.\n\n\nThen the corresponding \u03c4-functions give a solution to the \u2113-KT hierarchy, that is,\nfor each m with \u2113+1\u2264 m\u2264 M-1, the elements a_i,j in the Lax matrix L satisfy\n\n    a_m+k,k()=0    for     1\u2264 k\u2264 M-m,\n\nand a_\u2113+k,k() 0 for  some 1\u2264 k\u2264 M-\u2113.\n\nWhen \u2113 = 1, we recover the classical result of <cit.> in type A of the Lie algebra \ud835\udd24, we mentioned before for the tri-diagonal KT lattice.\n\nWe then apply the above machinery to  f-KT hierarchy defined on simple Lie algebras of type A, B, G, and for that we give explicitly the Chevalley basis and root space decompositions so that we can put the corresponding Lax matrices into the Hessenberg form. We also embed their Weyl groups into the symmetric group \ud835\udd16_M so that the second characterization of the \u2113-KT hierarchy can be applied. When L() is nilpotent, the \u03c4-functions become polynomials of . We construct all polynomial solutions for f-KT hierarchy in type A, B and G. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the last \u03c4-function in type B possesses a Pfaffian structure (Theorem <ref>, Proposition <ref>, Proposition <ref>, Proposition <ref>):\n\nThe \u03c4-function associated with w_* denoted by \u03c4^B_n(_B; w_*) is given by\n\n    \u03c4^B_n(_B, w_*)=\u221a(\u0394_n(_B))=\u2211_r\u2208\ud835\udd11_B\u03d5_r(_B)\u03b7_r(\u03be; w_*),\n\nwhere \ud835\udd11_B \u2245\u2124_2^n is the normal subgroup of the Weyl group \ud835\udd1a_B = \ud835\udd16_n \u22c9\u2124_2^n in type B.\nThe coefficients (\u03b7_r(\u03be; w_*))_r \u2208\ud835\udd11_B form a spinor and the \u03d5_r(_B)'s are exponential functions. For rational solutions, the \u03d5_r(_B)'s are given by Q-Schur polynomials. \n\nAs the Lie algebra of G_2-type could be embedded into a Lie algebra of B_3-type, the Pfaffian structure pertains in the \u03c4-functions of G_2. \n\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section <ref> we introduce our main object f-KT hierarchy in the Hessenberg form and their \u03c4-functions. In Section <ref> we give Schur expansion of the \u03c4-function \u0394_N(). In Section <ref>, we give the two characterizations for the \u2113-KT hierarchy in the Hessenberg form. In Section <ref> we define f-KT hierarchy and its \u03c4-functions on simple Lie algebras and present some of their basic properties. In Sections <ref>,  <ref> and  <ref>, we choose proper Chevalley basis to put the f-KT hierarchy in type A, B, G in the Hessenberg form and study their solutions especially the rational solutions and their banded structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE FULL KOSTANT-TODA LATTICE\n\nThe full Kostant-Toda (f-KT) lattice was first introduced in <cit.>, and it takes the following form,\n\n\n\n\n    dL/dt=[(L)_\u2265 0,L],\n\nwhere the Lax matrix L is the M\u00d7 M Hessenberg matrix, \n\n    L   =\u2211_i=1^M-1E_i,i+1+\u2211_1\u2264 j\u2264 i\u2264 Ma_i,jE_i,j\n       =\n    [   a_1,1       1       0       \u22ef       0;   a_2,1   a_2,2       1       \u22ef       0;       \u22ee       \u22ee       \u22f1       \u22f1       \u22ee; a_M-1,1 a_M-1,2       \u22ef       \u22ef       1;   a_M,1   a_M,2       \u22ef       \u22ef   a_M,M ],\n\nand (L)_\u2265 0 denotes the weakly upper triangular part of L. The E_i,j is the standard basis of the set of M\u00d7 M matrices defined by\n\n    E_i,j=(\u03b4_i,k\u03b4_j,l)_1\u2264 k,l\u2264 M.\n\nIn terms of the entries a_i,j=a_i,j(t),  \n\nthe f-KT lattice is defined by the system of equations\n\n    da_\u2113+k,k/dt=a_\u2113+k+1,k-a_\u2113+k,k-1+(a_\u2113+k,\u2113+k-a_k,k)a_\u2113+k,k\n\nfor  k=1,\u2026,M-\u2113 and \u2113=0,1,\u2026,M-1. Here we use the convention\nthat a_i,j=0  if \nj= 0 or i= M+1.  Note  that  the index \u2113 represents the \u2113-th subdiagonal of the matrix L, that is, \u2113=0 corresponds to \nthe diagonal elements\na_k,k and \u2113=1 corresponds to the elements a_k+1,k of the \nfirst subdiagonal, etc.  \n\n\n\nThe f-KT hierarchy consists of the symmetries of the f-KT lattice generated by the Chevalley invariants I_k=1/k+1tr(L^k+1) for k=1,\u2026,M-1 (c.f. <cit.>).\n\n\n\nEach symmetry is given by the equation\n\n    \u2202 L/\u2202 t_k=[(L^k)_\u22650, L],    for   k=1,2,\u2026, M-1.\n\nIn this paper, we formally use a set of infinitely many symmetries, whose flow parameter is denoted by\n\ud835\udc2d:=(t_1,t_2,\u2026). We call the set of all symmetries in the form (<ref>)\nthe f-KT lattice hierarchy, or simply f-KT hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Matrix factorization and the \u03c4-functions of the f-KT lattice\n\nTo find the solution L(t) of the f-KT lattice in terms of the initial matrix L(0),\nit is standard to consider the LU-factorization (Gauss decomposition) of the matrix exp(tL(0)):\n\n    exp(tL(0))=u(t)b(t)    with   u(t)\u2208\ud835\udca9^-,\u00a0 b(t)\u2208\u212c^+.\n\nwhere \ud835\udca9^- is the set of lower triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal, and\n\u212c^+ is the set of invertible upper triangular matrices.\nNote here that u(0)=b(0)=I, the identity matrix.\nIt is known and easy to show that this factorization exists if and only if the principal leading minors are all nonzero.  \nUnder this assumption, we let \u0394_N(t) denote the N-th leading principal minor, the determinant of the N\u00d7 N upper left corner of the matrix exp(tL(0)),\n\n    \u0394_N(t):=[exp(tL(0))]_N    for   N=1,2,\u2026,M.\n\nLet b(t)=h(t)n(t) be the decomposition with h(t) a diagonal matrix and n(t)\u2208\ud835\udca9^+, a unipotent upper triangular matrix. Then writing h(t)=exp(\u2211_i=1^Mc_i(t)E_i,i), we have \n\n    \u0394_N(t)=exp(\u2211_i=1^Nc_i(t)),  which gives   c_N(t)=ln\u0394_N(t)/\u0394_N-1(t).\n\nThis formula gives a key to express the solution of the f-KT lattice as explained below. \n\n\n\nWith the factorization (<ref>), we first have the following result (c.f. <cit.> which deals with the\noriginal Toda lattice).\n\nThe solution L(t) of (<ref>) is given by\n\n    L(t)=u^-1(t)L(0)u(t)=b(t)L(0)b(t)^-1.\n\n\n\nTaking the derivative of (<ref>), we have\n\n    d/dtexp(tL(0))=L(0)ub=ubL(0)=u\u0307b+u\u1e03,\n\nwhere \u1e8b means the derivative of x(t).

We call the f-KT hierarchy\nwith this banded Lax matrix the \u2113-KT hierarchy (see below for the details). Note that the 1-banded KT hierarchy is the\noriginal tridiagonal Kostant-Toda (KT) lattice hierarchy, and the (M-1)-banded KT hierarchy is the f-KT\nhierarchy.\n\nThen we have the following proposition:\n\nThe elements a_i,j in the \u2113-th diagonal of the \u2113-KT hierarchy are given by\n\n    a_k+\u2113, k()=a_k+\u2113,k^0\u0394_k+\u2113()\u0394_k-1()/\u0394_k+\u2113-1()\u0394_k()    for   1\u2264 k\u2264 M-\u2113,\n\nwhere a_k+\u2113,k^0 is a constant.\n\n\nSince a_\u2113+k+1,k=a_\u2113+k,k-1=0 for all 1\u2264 k\u2264 M-\u2113, the equations\n (<ref>) become\n \n    da_k+\u2113,k/dt=(a_k+\u2113,k+\u2113-a_k,k)a_k+\u2113,k.\n\nUsing the expression (<ref>) for a_i,i, we can integrate the equations and obtain the formula\nin the proposition.\n\n\nNote here that the constants a_k+\u2113,k^0 can be normalized as 1, if it is not zero. \nUsing Proposition <ref>, we have the bilinear equation for the \u2113-KT hierarchy,\n\n    p_\u2113+1(D\u0303)\u0394_k\u2218\u0394_k+\u2113-1()=a_k+\u2113,k^0\u0394_k+\u2113()\u0394_k-1()    for   1\u2264 k\u2264 M-\u2113.\n\n\nWhen \u2113=1, we see the bilinear equation of the original tridiagonal Toda lattice,\n\n    p_2(D\u0303)\u0394_k\u2218\u0394_k=1/2D_1^2\u0394_k\u2218\u0394_k=\u0394_k\u2202_1^2\u0394_k-(\u2202_1\u0394_k)^2=a_k+1,k^0\u0394_k+1\u0394_k-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The \u03c4-functions of the \u2113-KT hierarchy\n\nWe start with the following proposition on some properties of the \u2113-th diagonal elements in the Lax matrix.\n\nLet w_* be an element in S_M satisfying the following conditions,\n\n\n  (a)\nw_*(i) w_*(M-j+1)+1  for any   2\u2264 i+j\u2264 M-\u2113, and\n\n  (b) for some 1\u2264 i\u2264 M-\u2113, there is a relation,\n\n    w_*(i)=w_*(i+\u2113)+1.\n\n\nThen the corresponding \u03c4-functions \u0394_N(; w_*), 1 \u2264 N \u2264 M-1 give a solution to the \u2113-KT hierarchy, that is,\nfor each m with \u2113+1\u2264 m\u2264 M-1, the elements a_i,j in the Lax matrix L satisfy\n\n    a_m+k,k()=0    for     1\u2264 k\u2264 M-m,\n\nand a_\u2113+k,k() 0 for  some 1\u2264 k\u2264 M-\u2113.\n\n\n\nWe first note that a_M,1() satisfies \n\n    \u2202 a_M,1/\u2202 t_1=(a_M,M-a_1,1) a_M,1,\n\nwhich gives\n\n    a_M,1()=a_M,1^0\u0394_M\u0394_0/\u0394_M-1()\u0394_1(),\n\nwhere \u0394_0=1 and \u0394_M is a constant.  From (<ref>), we have\n\n    p_M(D\u0303)\u0394_1\u2218\u0394_M-1=a_M,1^0\u0394_M\u0394_0=constant.\n\nThe \u0394_1 and \u0394_M-1 are given by\n\n    \u0394_1()   =\u27e8 e_1,  \ud835\udcab()\u00b7  v_w_*(1)\u27e9=S_\u03bc_1()+h.o.t,\n    \u0394_M-1()   =\u27e8 e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_M-1,  \ud835\udcab()\u00b7 v_ w*(1)\u2227\u22ef\u2227 v_w_*(M-1)\u27e9=S_\u03bc_M-1()+h.o.t.,\n\nwhere the Young diagram \u03bc_1 and \u03bc_M-1 are given by\n\n    S_\u03bc_1()   =p_|\u03bc_1|()    with   |\u03bc_1|=w_*(1)-1,\n    \n    S_\u03bc_M-1()   =(-1)^|\u03bc_M-1|p_|\u03bc_M-1|(-)    with   |\u03bc_M-1|=M-w_*(M),\n\nthat is, \u03bc_1 consists of |\u03bc_1| horizontal boxes, and \u03bc_M-1 consists of |\u03bc_M-1|\nvertical boxes.\n\nThe degree of the left hand side of (<ref>) is given by\n\n    deg(\u0394_1)+deg(\u0394_M-1)-M=(w_*(1)-1)+(M-w_*(M))-M=w_*(1)-w_*(M)-1.\n\nSince the right hand side of (<ref>) has degree zero, if w_*(1) w_*(M)+1, then\na_M,1^0 must be zero. This confirms the case (a) with i=j=1 and \u2113=M-2.\n\nSuppose that a_M-a+k,k=0 for all 1\u2264 a\u2264 m-1 and 1\u2264 k\u2264 a.  Then we have\n\n    p_M-m+1(D\u0303)\u0394_k\u2218\u0394_M-(m-k)-1=a_M-m+k,k^0\u0394_k-1\u0394_M-(m-k).\n\n\n\n\nThe order of the left hand side of (<ref>) is then given by\n\n    (k_1+\u22ef+k_k-k(k+1)/2)+(M(m+1-k)-(l_1+\u22ef+l_m+1-k)-(m-k)(m-k+1)/2)-(M-m+1),\n\nwhere we denote w_*(i)=k_i and w_*(M-j+1)=l_j. The order of the right hand side of (<ref>) is\n\n    (k_1+\u2026+k_k-1-k(k-1)/2)+(M(m-k)-(l_1+\u22ef+l_m-k)-(m-k)(m-k-1)/2).\n\nThe condition that these orders are different is given by\n\n    k_k l_m+1-k+1,    which is     w_*(k) w_*(M-m+k)+1.\n\nSo if this is true, then we have a_M-m+k,k^0=0. That is, a_M-m+k,k()=0.\nContinuing this argument up to m=M-\u2113-1 gives the proof.\n\n\n\nThe two conditions on w_* in Proposition <ref> have the following more symmetric form\n\n\n  (a)\nw_*(i) w_*(i+k)+1  for any  k > \u2113, and\n\n  (b) for some 1\u2264 i\u2264 M-\u2113, there is a relation,\n\n    w_*(i)=w_*(i+\u2113)+1.\n\n\nCondition (a) means that no elements on the k-th off-diagonal is allowed to be nontrivial for k > \u2113 and condition (b) means some elements on the \u2113-th off-diagonal are non-trivial. These two conditions can be used independently. For example if the definition of \u2113-KT hierarchy is inclusive, that is \u2113 - 1-banded KT hierarchy is thought to be a sub of the \u2113-KT hierarchy, then only condition (a) is needed to be satisfied for all such w_*.\n\n\n\nLet w_*=w_0 be the longest element in S_M. Then the corresponding \u03c4-functions give a solution to the classical tridiagonal KT hierarchy.\n\n\nIt is obvious that w_0 satisfies the conditions in Proposition <ref> for \u2113 = 1. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE F-KT HIERARCHY ON SIMPLE LIE ALGEBRAS\n\nThe definition of f-KT lattice (hierarchy) in Section <ref> in the Hessenberg form can be extended to a system defined on some simple Lie algebras.  \nLet  be a connected simply connected complex semisimple Lie group with Lie algebra Lie() = \ud835\udd24.\nLet {H_i, X_i, Y_i} be the Chevalley basis of the Lie algebra g of rank n, which satisfy\n\n    [H_i, H_j]=0,     [H_i, X_j]=C_j,iX_j,     [H_i, Y_j]=-C_j,iY_j,     [X_i,Y_j]=\u03b4_i,jH_i,\n\nwhere C_i,j is the Cartan matrix of g. Let \u03a3^+ denote a set of positive roots, and let \u03a0={\u03b1_1,\u2026,\u03b1_n} be the set of simple roots. Note that  X_i=X_\u03b1_i and Y_i=Y_\u03b1_i=X_-\u03b1_i and C_i,j=\u03b1_i(H_j). \nThe negative root vectors Y_\u03b1 are generated by\n\n    [Y_\u03b1, Y_\u03b2]=N_-\u03b1,-\u03b2Y_\u03b1+\u03b2,    if  \u03b1+\u03b2\u2208\u03a3^+,\n\nwhere N_-\u03b1,-\u03b2 are constants. \n\nThe Lie algebra g admits the decomposition,\n\n    g=n_-\u2295h\u2295n_+=n_-\u2295b_+,\n\nwhere h is a Cartan subalgebra, n_\u00b1 are nilpotent subalgebras defined by n_\u00b1=\u2295_\u03b1\u2208\u03a3^+\u2102X_\u00b1\u03b1, and b_+ = n_+\u2295h is\nthe Borel subalgebra.   We also fix a split Cartan subgroup \u210b with Lie(\u210b) = \ud835\udd25 and a Borel subgroup \u212c with Lie(\u212c) = b_+ with \u212c = \u210b\ud835\udca9 where \ud835\udca9 is a Lie group having the Lie algebra \ud835\udd2b_+. We also denote Lie groups \u212c^- and \ud835\udca9^-  with Lie(\u212c^-) = \ud835\udd1f_- and  Lie(\ud835\udca9^-) = \ud835\udd2b_-.\nThen the full Kostant-Toda (f-KT) hierarchy on the Lie algebra \ud835\udd24 is defined as follows.\nLet L_g be the element defined by\n\n    L_g   =\u2211_i=1^n a_i()H_i+\u2211_i=1^nX_i+\u2211_\u03b1\u2208\u03a3^+b_\u03b1()Y_\u03b1,\n       =\u2211_i=1^n (a_i()H_i+X_i+b_i()Y_i)+\u2211_\u03b1\u2208\u03a3^+\u2216\u03a0b_\u03b1()Y_\u03b1,\n\nwhich is called the Lax matrix.\nHere  a_i() and b_\u03b1() are functions of the multi-time variables =(t_m_k:k=1,2,\u2026,n)\nwhere m_k is defined below. \nFor each time variable, we have the generalized Toda hierarchy defined by\n\n    \u2202 L_g/\u2202 t_m_k=[P_k, L_g],    with   P_k=\u03a0_b_+\u2207 I_k+1,\n\nwhere  \u2207 is the gradient with respect to the Killing form, i.e. for any x\u2208g, dI_k(x)=K(\u2207 I_k,x),\nand \u03a0_\ud835\udd1f_+ represents the \ud835\udd1f_+-projection.\nHere the functions I_k=I_k(L_g) are the Chevalley invariants which, for example in type A are defined by\n\n    I_k+1(L_g)=1/k+1tr(L_g^k+1),  which gives  \u2207 I_k+1=L_g^k.\n\n\nIn the case of the Lie algebra \ud835\udd24 of type D, the recent paper <cit.> shows that one of the Chevalley invariants is given by a Pfaffian of the ring of polynomials [\ud835\udd24].\n\n\n\n\nNote here that I_k is a weighted homogeneous polynomial of (a_i,b_\u03b1) of weight k, where the weights are defined as\n\n    wt(a_i)=1,    wt(b_\u03b1)=ht(\u03b1)+1.\n\nHere ht(\u03b1) represents the height of \u03b1, which is defined by \u2211_i=1^nc_i for \u03b1=\u2211_i=1^nc_i\u03b1_i.\nThe index m_k of the time variable in (<ref>) is then defined by m_k=wt(I_k+1)-1.  \nFor example, in the case of k=1, the f-KT lattice gives the following set of differential equations for the variables {(a_i,b_\u03b1):1\u2264 i\u2264 n, \u03b1\u2208\u03a3^+},\n\n    \u2202 a_i/\u2202 t_1=b_i   (1\u2264 i\u2264 n),    \u2202 b_\u03b1/\u2202 t_1=-\u2211_i=1^n (\u03b1(H_i)a_i) b_\u03b1+\u2211_i=1^nN_\u03b1_i,-\u03b1-\u03b1_ib_\u03b1+\u03b1_i,\n\nwhere  b_i=b_\u03b1_i, [H_i,Y_\u03b1]=-\u03b1(H_i)Y_\u03b1 and [X_\u03b1_i, Y_\u03b1+\u03b1_i]=N_\u03b1_i, -\u03b1-\u03b1_iY_\u03b1 for \u03b1+\u03b1_i\u2208\u03a3^+.   Notice that wt(\u2202/\u2202 t_1)=1, and the f-KT lattice consists of the weighted homogeneous equations. \nThen one can see  that the solutions b_\u03b1() of weight ht(\u03b1)+1 are determined by the functions a_i() of weight 1. The Kostant-Toda lattice hierarchy is then a special case with all b_\u03b1()=0 for \u03b1\u2208\u03a3^+\u2216\u03a0, \nthat is, the Lax matrix L_\ud835\udd24 is a Jacobi element of \ud835\udd24. The hierarchy of this type is also referred to as the tri-diagonal KT hierarchy.\nIn this case, Flaschka and Heine in <cit.> introduced the so-called \u03c4-functions which express the variables a_i() by\n\n    a_i()=\u2202/\u2202 t_1ln\u03c4_i(),     (1\u2264 i\u2264 n),\n\n(see also <cit.>).\nThen b_i() are expressed by\n\n    b_i()=\u2202/\u2202 t_1a_i()=b_i^0\u220f_j=1^n(\u03c4_j())^-C_i,j,\n\nwhere C_i,j is the Cartan matrix and b_i^0  are constants. \n\nIn general, the \u03c4-function is defined as follows (c.f. <cit.>). Let V(\u03bb) be the irreducible highest weight representation of \nthe group \ud835\udca2 with highest weight \u03bb and the highest weight vector v_\u03bb. Then\nthere exists a unique bilinear form \u27e8\u00b7,\u00b7\u27e9: V(\u03bb)\u00d7 V(\u03bb)\u2192 with the normalization\n\u27e8 v_\u03bb,v_\u03bb\u27e9_\u03bb=1, and a matrix coefficient c_\u03bb(g) for the \ud835\udca2-orbit of the highest weight vector g\u00b7 v_\u03bb for g\u2208\ud835\udca2 is given by\n\n    c_\u03bb(g)=\u27e8 v_\u03bb, g\u00b7 v_\u03bb\u27e9_\u03bb.\n\nThen the \u03c4-functions are defined as the matrix coefficient for g()=exp(\u0398_L^0()) with the fundamental weight \n\u03d6_i (c.f. <cit.>),\n\n    \u03c4_i():=c_\u03d6_i()=\u27e8 v_\u03d6_i,g()\u00b7 v_\u03d6_i\u27e9_\u03d6_i.\n\n\nThe  following lemma for the matrix coefficient is useful (the proof can be found in <cit.>).\n\n\n\n\n\n  (1)\nIf { u_1, \u2026, u_r } is an orthonormal basis of V(\u03bb), \nthen we have for v, w \u2208 V(\u03bb),\n\n    \u27e8 v, gh \u00b7 w \u27e9_\u03bb\n     =\n    \u2211_i=1^r\n     \u27e8 v, g \u00b7 u_i \u27e9_\u03bb\u27e8 u_i, h \u00b7 w \u27e9_\u03bb.\n\n\n  (2)\nIf g \u2208 GL_n+1 is written as g = n^- h n^+ \nwith n^- \u2208\ud835\udca9^-, h \u2208 and n^+ \u2208\ud835\udca9^+, \nthen we have\n\n    c_\u03bb(n^- h n^+) = \u03c7^\u03bb(h),\n\nwhere \u03c7^\u03bb: \u2192^\u00d7 is the character \ncorresponding to \u03bb.\n\n  (3)\nFor dominant weights \u03bb and \u03bc, we have\n\n    c_\u03bb(g) \u00b7 c_\u03bc(g) = c_\u03bb+\u03bc(g)\n        (g \u2208 GL).\n\n\n\n\nWe now show that the solutions of the f-KT hierarchy (<ref>) are described \nin terms of the \u03c4-functions given by (<ref>). We also give a remark on the banded f-KT hierarchy.\nFirst we note that the coefficients b_\u03b1 of a solution \nto (<ref>) are uniquely determined by a_1, \u2026, a_n.\n\n\n\nIf L = L() is a solution of the form (<ref>) \nto the full Kostant\u2013Toda hierarchy (<ref>), \nthen b_\u03b1's (\u03b1\u2208\u03a3^+) \nare expressed as polynomials in a_i's and their derivatives.\nIn particular, we have\n\n    b_\u03b1_i = \u2202 a_i/\u2202 t_1    (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n).\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the height ht(\u03b1) of a root \n\u03b1 = \u2211_i=1^n c_i \u03b1_i \u2208\u03a3 is defined by \nht(\u03b1) = \u2211_i=1^n c_i.\nFor a nonzero integer k, let _k be the span of root vectors \nX_\u03b1 with (\u03b1) = k.\nAnd we put _0 =.\nThen we have\n\n    = \u2295_k \u2208_k,\n      \n    [_k, _l] \u2282_k+l.\n    \n        If we put\n    \n    L_1 = \u2211_i=1^n X_\u03b1_i,\n      \n    L_0 = \u2211_i=1^n a_i(t) H_i,\n      \n    L_-k = \u2211_(\u03b1) = k b_\u03b1(t) X_-\u03b1    (k > 0),\n\nthen we have\n\n    L = L_1 + L_0 + L_-1 + L_-2 + \u22ef,\n      \n    L^\u2265 0 = L_1 + L_0,\n      \n    L_k \u2208_k.\n\nBy comparing the graded components of (<ref>) with m_k=1, we obtain\n\n    \u2202 L_0 /\u2202 t_1  = [L_1, L_-1],\n    \n    \u2202 L_-k/\u2202 t_1  = [L_1,L_-k+1] + [L_0, L_-k]\n      (k>0).\n\n\nSince [L_1, L_-1] = \u2211_i=1^n b_\u03b1_i H_i, we obtain (<ref>) \nfrom (<ref>) by comparing the coefficients of H_i.\n\nWe prove by induction on (\u03b2) that \nb_\u03b2 can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination \nof a_i b_\u03b1 and \u2202 b_\u03b1/\u2202 t_1 with \n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and (\u03b1) = (\u03b2)-1.\nSuppose k>0.\nEquating the coefficients of X_-\u03b1 with (\u03b1) = k \nin (<ref>), we obtain\n\n    \u2202 b_\u03b1/\u2202 t_1\n     =\n    - (\u2211_i=1^n\u03b1(H_i) a_i) b_\u03b1 \n    + \u2211_(\u03b2)=k+1 N_\u03b2-\u03b1,-\u03b2 b_\u03b2    ((\u03b1) = k),\n\nwhere N_\u03b2-\u03b1,-\u03b2 = 0 unless \u03b2-\u03b1 is a simple root.\nWe regard (<ref>) as a system of linear equations in the unknown variables \nb_\u03b2 ((\u03b2)=k+1) and consider the coefficient matrix\n\n    M\n     = \n    ( N_\u03b2-\u03b1,-\u03b2)_(\u03b1) = k,  (\u03b2)=k+1.\n\nOn the other hand, it can be shown that M is the representation matrix \nof the linear map L_1 : _-(k+1)\u2192_-k.\nSince L_1 = \u2211_i=1^n X_\u03b1_i, \nwe can find a principal _2-triple { h, e, f } \nwith e = L_1 such that [h,e] = 2e, [h,f] = -2f and [e,f] = h, \nand we have _k = { X \u2208 : [h,X] = 2k X } (see <cit.>).\nBy appealing to the representation theory of _2, \nwe see that L_1 : _-(k+1)\u2192_-k is injective.\nHence the matrix M has a full rank \nand the system (<ref>) of linear equations has a unique solution \nin (b_\u03b2)_(\u03b2) = k+1.\n\n\nWe then define the l-KT hierarchy on \ud835\udd24 by imposing the following constraints (or reduction, see <cit.>),\n\n    b_\u03b1 = 0\n      with    (\u03b1) \u2265\u2113+1.\n\nThus, the \u2113-KT hierarchy is a reduction of the f-KT hiersrchy based on the root space decomposition with particular height, which we refer to as a root space reduction.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Coordinates for the flag varieties\n\nThe \u03c4-functions near the Painlev\u00e9 divisors can be expressed as follows. Assume that the matrix g() at a Painlev\u00e9\ndivisor =_* has the Bruhat decomposition,\n\n    g(_*) = n_*\u1e87_*b_*     for some     w_* \u2208\ud835\udd1a,\n\nwhere \ud835\udd1a is the Weyl group of \ud835\udca2. Let {u_1, \u2026, u_r} be an orthonormal basis of V(\u03d6_i), and set \u2192 + _*, then by (<ref>) we have\n\n    \u03c4_i()     = \u27e8 v_\u03d6_i,g() n_*\u1e87_*b_*\u00b7 v_\u03d6_i\u27e9_\u03d6_i\n        = \u2211_i = 1^r \u27e8 v_\u03d6_i, g() \u00b7 u_i\u27e9_\u03d6_i\u27e8 u_i, n_*\u1e87_*b_* \u00b7 v_\u03d6_i\u27e9_\u03d6_i\n        = d_i \u2211_i = 1^r \u27e8 v_\u03d6_i, g() \u00b7 u_i\u27e9_\u03d6_i\u27e8 u_i, n_*\u1e87_* \u00b7 v_\u03d6_i\u27e9_\u03d6_i,\n\nwhere d_i defined by b_* \u00b7 v_\u03d6_i = d_iv_\u03d6 is an overall non-essential constant which we set it to be 1 in the following. Note that \u27e8 u_i, n_*\u1e87_* \u00b7 v_\u03d6_i\u27e9_\u03d6_i is certain matrix coefficient of a point in the flag variety \ud835\udca2\u212c, and we recall some useful construction of coordinates on the flag varieties in the following.\n\nThe datum {\u210b, \u212c, \u212c^-, X_i, Y_i (1\u2264 i\u2264 n)} is called a pinning in <cit.>. It is known that pinning is unique up to conjugation under \ud835\udca2. For \u03b1_i \u2208\u03a0, let x_i: \u2102\u2192\ud835\udca2 and y_i: \u2102\u2192\ud835\udca2 be the one-parameter subgroups given by\n\n    x_i(\u03be) = exp (\u03be X_i),      y_i(\u03be) = exp(\u03be Y_i),   \u03be\u2208\u2102.\n\nFor \u03b1_i \u2208\u03a0, a choice of representative of s_i \u2208\ud835\udcb2 in \ud835\udca2 can be taken as\n\n    \u1e61_i = x_i(-1)y_i(1)x_i(-1).\n\n\nFor w \u2208\ud835\udcb2, the \u212c-orbit \ud835\udcaa^+_w = \u212cw\u212c\u212c and \u212c^--orbit \ud835\udcaa^-_w = \u212c^-w\u212c\u212c in \ud835\udca2\u212c are called the Bruhat cell and opposite Bruhat cell corresponding to w, respectively. Let\n\n    \ud835\udca9_w = \ud835\udca9\u2229\u1e87\ud835\udca9^-\u1e87^-1    and    \ud835\udca9^-_w = \ud835\udca9^- \u2229\u1e87\ud835\udca9^-\u1e87^-1,\n\nthen we have the following isomorphisms\n\n    \ud835\udca9_w \u2192\u212cw\u212c\u212c,      a \u21a6 a\u1e87\u212c,    a \u2208\ud835\udca9_w,\n       \ud835\udca9^-_w \u2192\u212c^-w\u212c\u212c,      b \u21a6 b\u1e87\u212c,    b \u2208\ud835\udca9_w.\n\nLet \u2113(w) denote the length of w \u2208\ud835\udcb2.

For w \u2208\ud835\udcb2, let \u0175 be defined by\n\n    \u0175\u00b7 w = w_0     or    \u0175 = w_0 \u00b7 w^-1.\n\nThe identity\n\n    \ud835\udca9^-_w = \u0175\u0307^-1\ud835\udca9_\u0175\u0175\u0307\n\ngives rise to the isomorphism\n\n    [      \u03c8_w:  \u212c^- w \u212c\u212c         \u27f6     \ud835\udcaa^+_\u0175;                a \u1e87\u212c         \u21a6 \u0175\u0307 a^-1\u212c, ]\n\nwhere a \u2208\ud835\udca9^-_w. A parameterization for \ud835\udcaa^-_w can thus be obtained as \u03d5_\u0175\u2218\u03c8^-1_w: \u2102^k \u2192\ud835\udcaa^-_w, where k = \u2113(\u0175) = \u2113(w_0) - \u2113(w), and following <cit.> we call it the Bott-Samelson coordinate for \ud835\udcaa^-_w associated with the reduced word \u0175 = s_i_1s_i_2\u22ef s_i_k.\n\nAnother coordinate which is defined only on an open subset of \ud835\udcaa^-_w can be described as follows. Recall that the Richardson variety \u211b_v, w is defined as\n\n    \u211b_v, w := \ud835\udcaa^+_w \u2229\ud835\udcaa^-_v,\n\nwhich is nonempty precisely when v \u2264 w in the Bruhat order. Let \u0175 be defined as above, and \u0175 = s_i_1s_i_2\u22ef s_i_k be a reduced expression for \u0175. Then the map\n\n    [                                 \u03c6_\u0175:                                  \u2102^k                                    \u27f6                             \u211b_w, w_0;                                                             (\u03be_1, \u2026, \u03be_k)                                    \u21a6 y_i_1(\u03be_1) y_i_2(\u03be_2) \u22ef y_i_k(\u03be_k)\u1e87\u212c ]\n\ndefines an isomorphism (c.f. <cit.>). We call the coordinate system on \u211b_w, w_0\u2282\ud835\udcaa^-_w  Lusztig coordinate for \u211b_w, w_0 associated with the reduced word \u0175 = s_i_1s_i_2\u22ef s_i_k. Note that the image of \u03c6_\u0175 does not depend on the reduced word we choose for \u0175. Note also that \u211b_w, w_0 = w_0\u212c^-\u212c\u2229\ud835\udcaa^-_w is the intersection of \ud835\udcaa^-_w with the shifted big cell w_0\u212c^-\u212c, so that \u03c6 only defines a coordinate on an open dense subspace of \ud835\udcaa^-_w.\n\nFor simplicity we mainly use the Lusztig coordinate for a generic element in the corresponding Bruhat cell in the rest of the paper. We will give a concrete example to illustrate the difference between the two coordinate systems (see (<ref>) and (<ref>) below for the parameterizations of a generic element in the flag variety of B_2). \n\n\nWe will discuss the f-KT hierarchies on the Lie algebras of A-, B- and G-types in this paper by embedding those\nequations into the f-KT lattice in the Hessenberg form (<ref>). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE F-KT HIERARCHY OF TYPE A\n\nNow let us consider the f-KT hierarchy discussed in the previous sections in the frame of the Lie algebra of type A,\n\n    \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd29_n+1():={X\u2208End(^n+1): tr(X)=0}.\n\nRecall that \ud835\udd24=\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd29_n+1() has a triangular decomposition, \ud835\udd24=\ud835\udd2b_+\u2295\ud835\udd25\u2295\ud835\udd2b_-, where \ud835\udd25 (resp. \ud835\udd2b_+, \ud835\udd2b_-) is a subgroup of \ud835\udd24 consisting of diagonal matrices (resp. strictly upper triangular matrices, strictly lower triangular matrices). Then the Cartan subalgebra \ud835\udd25 is given by\n\n    \ud835\udd25={diag(h_1,\u2026,h_n+1): \u00a0\u2211_i=1^n+1h_i=0,\u00a0h_i\u2208}.\n\nLet \u03b5_i be the linear map _i:\ud835\udd25\u2192 given by \u03b5_i(diag(h_1,\u2026,h_n+1))=h_i. Then \n\nthe root system of \ud835\udd24 with respect to \ud835\udd25 is given by\n\n    \u03a3_A_n={\u00b1(_i-_j): 1\u2264 i<j\u2264 n + 1}.\n\n\nIn particular, the positive root system is given by\n\n    \u03a3^+_A_n={\u03b5_i-\u03b5_j= \u03b1_i+\u03b1_i+1+\u22ef+\u03b1_j-1: 1\u2264 i< j\u2264 n+1}.\n\nNote that the simple roots are given by \u03b1_i=\u03b5_i-\u03b5_i+1 and  |\u03a3^+_A_n|=n(n+1)/2.\n\nWe take the Chevalley basis in the form,\n\n    H_i=E_i,i-E_i+1,i+1,      X_i=E_i,i+1,     Y_i=E_i+1,i,     (1\u2264 i\u2264 n).\n\nThe root vectors Y__i-_j, (i<j) are defined by\n\n    Y__i-_j=E_j,i=(-1)^j-i[[\u22ef[[Y_i,Y_i+1],Y_i+2]\u22ef ],Y_j-1].\n\nThen the Lax matrix L_A\u2208\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd29_n+1() for \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd29_n+1() is given by\n\n    L_A   =\u2211_i=1^n(a_iH_i+X_i+b_iY_i)+\u2211_j=3^n+1\u2211_i=1^j-1b__i-_jY__i-_j\n       =[       a_1         1         0         \u22ef         0         0;       b_1   a_2-a_1         1         \u22ef         0         0;   b__1-_3       b_2   a_3-a_2         \u22f1         \u22ee         \u22ee;         \u22ee         \u22ee         \u22f1         \u22f1         1         \u22ee;   b__1-_n   b__2-_n         \u22ef         \u22ef a_n-a_n-1         1; b__1-_n+1 b__2-_n+1         \u22ef         \u22ef       b_n      -a_n ],\n\nwith b_i=b__i-_i+1, and the f-KT equation of A-type,\n\n    \u2202 L_A/\u2202 t_1=[P_A, L_A]    with     P_A=\u2211_i=1^n(a_iH_i+X_i),\n\nwhich gives\n\n    {[                                                          \u2202 a_i/\u2202 t_1=b_i     (1\u2264 i\u2264 n),; \u2202 b__i-_j/\u2202 t_1=-(\u2211_k=1^n(_i-_j)(H_k)a_k) b__i-_j+b__i-_j+1-b__i-1-_j     (1\u2264 i< j\u2264 n), ].\n\nwhere _i(H_k)=\u03b4_i,k-\u03b4_i,k+1.\nComparing the Lax matrix L_A with L in (<ref>), we have\n\n    a_i,i   =a_i-a_i-1     (1\u2264 i\u2264 n+1),\n    \n    a_\u2113+k,k   =b__k-_\u2113+k     (1\u2264 k\u2264 n-\u2113+1,  1\u2264\u2113\u2264 n).\n\nThese entries of L_A can be written by\n\n    a_i   =\u2202/\u2202 t_1ln\u03c4^A_i(),     (1\u2264 i\u2264 n),\n    \n    b__k-_\u2113+k   =p_\u2113+1(D\u0303)\u03c4^A_k()\u2218\u03c4^A_\u2113+k-1()/\u03c4^A_k()\u03c4^A_\u2113+k-1()     (1\u2264 k\u2264 n-\u2113+1),\n\nwhere the \u03c4^A-functions are defined in (<ref>). \nRecall first that the exterior product space \u2227^i^n+1 gives the irreducible highest weight representation of SL_n+1() with the\nhighest weight \u03d6_i=_1+\u22ef+_i and the highest weight vector v_\u03d6_i=e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_i.\nNote here that \u03d6_i(H_j)=\u03b4_i,j. \nThen the \u03c4-functions are expressed as the determinants of the leading principal minors of g()=exp(\u0398_L^0()), i.e.\n\n    \u03c4^A_i()=\u27e8 v_\u03d6_i, g()\u00b7 v_\u03d6_i\u27e9_\u03d6_i=\u27e8 e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_i,   e^\u0398_L^0() e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_i\u27e9=\u0394_i()     (1\u2264 i\u2264 n),\n\nwhere \u27e8\u00b7,\u00b7\u27e9 is nothing but the usual inner product (determinant) on \u2227^i^n+1, and\n\u0394_i() is the i-th principle minor of the matrix g().\nThey are the well-known \u03c4-functions for the f-KT hierarchy of type A (c.f. <cit.>). One should note that these formulas have been given in <cit.> for\nthe case of tridiagonal Toda lattice. Here we claim that the formula is still valid for the f-KT hierarchy.\n\nWe here also give an expansion form of the \u03c4-function about a Painlev\u00e9 divisor _* with\ne^\u0398_L^0(_*)=n_*w_*b_*, \n\n    \u03c4_i^A()   =\u0394_i()=\u27e8 e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_i, e^\u0398_L^0() n_*w_*b_*\u00b7 e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_i\u27e9\n       =\u2211_1\u2264 j_1<\u22ef<j_i\u2264 n+1\u27e8 e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_i, e^\u0398_L^0() e_j_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_j_i\u27e9 \u27e8 e_j_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_j_i, n_*w_*b_*\u00b7 e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_i\u27e9.\n\nThis formula is due to (<ref>) in Lemma <ref>. Here note that the set {e_j_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_j_i:1\u2264 j_1<\u22ef<j_i\u2264 n+1} forms the orthonormal basis of \u2227^i^n+1.\nIf the initial matrix L^0 is nilpotent, the \u03c4-functions become polynomials of . We study the polynomial solutions in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Polynomial \u03c4-functions\n\nIn (<ref>), if we set all the eigenvalues zero, i.e. \u03ba_i=0 for all i, then we have\n\n    \u03c4_i^A(; w_*)=\u27e8 e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_i,\ud835\udcab_n^A()n_*\u00b7 e_w_*(1)\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_w_*(i)\u27e9,      (1\u2264 i\u2264 n),\n\nwhere \ud835\udcab_n^A() is the (n+1)\u00d7 (n+1) matrix given in (<ref>), \n\n    \ud835\udcab_n^A()=\ud835\udcab_n+1()=[         1     p_1()     p_2()     p_3()         \u22ef     p_n();         0         1     p_1()     p_2()        \u22ef\u22ef   p_n-1();         \u22ee         \u22f1         \u22f1         \u22f1         \u22ef         \u22ee;         0         \u22ef         0         1         \u22ef p_n-i+1();         \u22ee         \u22ee         \u22ee         \u22f1         \u22f1         \u22ee;         0         \u22ef         \u22ef         \u22ef         0         1 ].\n\n\nWe note that the classification of the polynomial solutions for type A can be obtained by listing all permutations w_*\u2208\ud835\udd16_n+1.  We also need an element n_* in (<ref>) for each w_*, which is constructed as follows (see also <cit.>).  The matrix y^A_i(\u03be)\u2208 SL_n+1 defined in (<ref>) is given by\n\n    y_i^A(\u03be):=exp(\u03be Y_i)=\n    [ 1          ;   \u22f1        ;     1      ;     \u03be 1    ;           \u22f1;             1 ]     (1\u2264 i\u2264 n),\n\nwhere \u03be is a parameter.  For each w_*\u2208\ud835\udd16_n+1, \nlet \u0175 be defined by\n \n    \u0175\u00b7 w_* = w_0    or    \u0175=w_0\u00b7 w_*^-1,\n\n where w_0 is the longest element in \ud835\udd16_n+1.\nWe write \u0175 in a reduced expression, \n \n    \u0175=s_i_1s_i_2\u22ef s_i_m  with   m=\u2113(\u0175)=\u2113(w_0)-\u2113(w_*),\n\n  where \u2113(w) denotes the length of w.\n Then the n_* associated with w_* in the Lusztig coordinate (<ref>) is given by \n\n    n_*=y^A_i_1(\u03be_1) y^A_i_2(\u03be_2) \u22ef  y^A_i_m(\u03be_m),\n\nwhere {\u03be_1,\u2026,\u03be_m} gives the set of free parameters.  That is, the element n_*\u1e87_* mod(\u212c^+) gives a generic element in the corresponding Bruhat cell of the flag SL_n+1/\u212c^+, and the dimension of the cell is m=\u2113(\u0175).\n\nAs an example, consider\n w_*=s_1s_2s_3s_4s_1s_3s_2 for the f-KT hierarchy of A_4-type.

Then Lemma <ref>, i.e. h_k=e_k proves the proposition.\n\u25a1\n\nNow we consider  the Schur polynomial associated with w\u2208\ud835\udd1a_B,\n\n    S_\u03bb(w)(_B)=\u27e8 e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_n,\u00a0\ud835\udcab_n^B(_B)\u1e87\u00b7 e_1\u2227\u22ef\u2227 e_n\u27e9,\n\nwhere \u03bb(w)=(i_n-n,\u2026,i_2-2,i_1-1) with {w(1),\u2026,w(n)}={i_1<i_2<\u22ef<i_n}.\nTo find \u03bb(w), we first note the following lemma.\n\nFor an element r_k\u2208\ud835\udd11_B, the corresponding Young diagram \u03bb(r_k) is expressed in the following Frobenius notation,\n\n    \u03bb(r_k)=(n-k+1|n-k),\n\nwhich is the hook diagram (n-k+2, 1^n-k).\n\n\nSince we have\n\n    r_k\u00b7(1,2,\u2026,n)=(1,\u2026, k-1,k\u0305, k+1,\u2026,n)    with    k\u0305=2n+2-k.\n\nThe corresponding Young diagram is \u03bb=(n+2-k, 1^n-k), which is (n-k+1|n-k) in the Frobenius notation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we have the following proposition on \u03bb(w).\n\nIn the Frobeneus notation, the Young diagram \u03bb(w) can be expressed in the form,\n\n    \u03bb(w)=(\u03b1_1,\u03b1_2,\u2026,\u03b1_m | \u03b1_1-1,\u03b1_2-1,\u2026,\u03b1_m-1),\n\nwhere \u03b1_m\u2265 1 with some constant m.\n\n\n Let us take the following example with n=7. We consider\n \n    w\u00b7(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)=\u1e59_2\u1e59_4 \u1e59_7(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)=(1,2\u0305,3,4\u0305,5,6,7\u0305)=(1, 14, 3, 12, 5, 6, 9).\n\n Then from Lemma <ref>, we have\n \n    \u03bb(r_2)=(6|5),    \u03bb(r_4)=(4|3),    \u03bb(r_7)=(1|0).\n\n That is, this proposition states that \n \n    \u03bb(w)=\u03bb(r_2r_4r_7)=(6,4,1|5,3,0).\n\n This may be understood as follows.\nFirst express w in the following diagram (Sato's Maya-diagram),\n\n    [15][12][0.4cm*8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,]\n\n\nwhich can also be written as \n\n    w\u00b7 (1,2,\u2026,15)=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15),\n\nwhere k\u0305 for an index k is marked with a white stone at the k-th box in the Maya diagram, and other indices without \u201cbar\u201d are marked with the black stones. In particular, the 8-th ((n+1)-th) box from left is always marked with a white stone.  Note that k=16-k, in general, k=2n+2-k, and n+1=n+1.  Then the corresponding Young diagram is given by \u03bb_n-j+1=i_j-j, i.e. in this example, we have\n\n    \u03bb(w)=(7,6,4,2,2,1,0),\n\nwhich is\n\n\n\n    [7,6,4,2,2,1][8].\n\n\nIt is known that the Maya diagram has a direct connection with the Young diagram.\nStarting from the bottom left corner, we can take the lattice path along the boundary of the Young diagram in counterclockwise direction and assign each edge with the number from 1 to 2n+1, so that each horizontal edge is labeled by an index with \u201cbar\u201d and each vertical edge is labeled by the index without \u201cbar\u201d.\nThe horizontal and vertical edges in each hook diagram are labeled by k and k=2n+2-k for some number k. Then it is easy to see that the number of vertical boxes in the hook diagram is given by n-k+1, and that the number of the horizontal boxes is k-(n+1)+1=n+2-k. That is, in the Frobenius \nnotation, this hook diagram is expressed by (n-k+1,n-k), which proves the lemma.  Note that the number m in the formula is given by the total number of indices with \u201cbar\u201d in w(1,\u2026,n), i.e. the length of r in w.\nIn the example, we have m=3 with (2, 4,7) (r=r_2r_4r_7), and then we have\n\n    \u03bb(w)=(6,4,1|5,3,0).\n\n\n\nNow we have the Jozefiak-Pragacz type identity  of  the Schur polynomial S_\u03bb(w)(_B) for each w\u2208\ud835\udd1a_B<cit.>.\n\nLet \u03bb( w) be given in the following Frobenius formula,\n\n    \u03bb(w)=(\u03b1_1-1,\u03b1_2-1,\u2026,\u03b1_s-1 | \u03b1_1,\u03b1_2,\u2026,\u03b1_s).\n\nThen the Schur polynomial can be expressed by\n\n    S_\u03bb(w)(_B)=1/2^sQ_\u03b1(_B)^2,\n\nwhere Q_\u03b1(_B) is the Q-Schur polynomial with the Young diagram \u03b1=(\u03b1_1,\u03b1_2,\u2026,\u03b1_s).\nNote here that if s is odd, then we add 0 at the end so that \u03b1=(\u03b1_1,\u2026,\u03b1_s,0).\n\n\n With the Frobenius notation,  the Giambelli formula gives\n\n    S_\u03bb(w)=|\n    S_(\u03b1_1-1|\u03b1_1)    S_(\u03b1_1-1|\u03b1_2)   \u22ef   S_(\u03b1_1-1|\u03b1_s)\n    \n    S_(\u03b1_2-1|\u03b1_1)   S_(\u03b1_2-1|\u03b1_2)   \u22ef   S_(\u03b1_2-1|\u03b1_s)\n    \u22ee   \u22ee   \u22f1   \u22ee\n    \n    S_(\u03b1_s-1|\u03b1_1)    S_(\u03b1_s-1|\u03b1_2)   \u22ef   S_(\u03b1_s-1|\u03b1_s)|,\n\nwhere (\u03b1|\u03b2) is the Young diagram of hook, (\u03b1+1,1^\u03b2).
