These areas include spectral theory, scattering theory, tiling problems, integrable systems, and stochastic processes. For further details and insights on these subjects, refer to <cit.>, <cit.>, <cit.>, <cit.>, <cit.>, <cit.>, and the references therein.\n\t\n\tSignificant progress has been made in the past two decades towards understanding how the differential and algebraic properties of classical scalar orthogonal polynomials can be extended to the matrix valued setting. A fundamental role has been played by the connection between harmonic analysis of matrix valued functions on compact symmetric pairs and matrix valued orthogonal polynomials. In <cit.>, A. Dur\u00e1n poses the problem of determining families of MVOPs which are eigenfunctions of a suitable second order differential operator. In the scalar case, the answer to this problem is a classical result due to Bochner <cit.>. The only families with this property are those of Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi. The matrix valued setting turns out to be much more involved. The first explicit examples appeared in connection with spherical functions of the compact symmetric pair (SU(3),U(2)). Following <cit.>, a direct approach was taken in <cit.>, <cit.> for the case of (SU(2) \u00d7SU(2), diag), leading to a general set-up in the context of multiplicity free pairs <cit.>. In this context, certain properties of the orthogonal polynomials, such as orthogonality, recurrence relations, and differential equations, are understood in terms of the representation theory of the corresponding symmetric spaces. Recently, Casper and Yakimov developed a framework in <cit.> to solve the matrix Bochner problem. This involves the classification of all N \u00d7 N weight matrix W(x) whose associated MVOPs are eigenfunctions of a second-order differential operator.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tGiven N \u2208\u2115 we consider a matrix valued function W: [a,b] \u2192 M_N(\u2102) such that W(x) is positive definite for all x\u2208 [a,b] and W has finite moments of all order. In such a case, we say that W is a weight function,  which induces matrix valued inner product\n\t\n    \u27e8 P,Q \u27e9=\u222b_a^b P(x)W(x)Q(x)^*dx \u2208 M_N(),\n\n\tsuch that for all P,Q,R\u2208 M_N()[x], T\u2208 M_N(C) and a,b\u2208\u2102 \n\tthe following properties are satisfied\n\t\n    \u27e8 aP+bQ,R\u27e9=a\u27e8 P,R\u27e9+b\u27e8 Q,R\u27e9,     \u27e8 TP,Q\u27e9=T\u27e8 P,Q\u27e9, \u27e8 P,Q\u27e9^*=\u27e8 Q,P\u27e9.\n\n\tMoreover \u27e8 P,P \u27e9 = 0 if and only if P=0. Using standard arguments, it can be shown that there exists a unique sequence (P(x,n))_n monic MVOPs with respect to W in the following sense:\n\t\n    \u27e8 P(x,n), P(x,m)\u27e9 = \u210b(n) \u03b4_n,m.\n\n\twhere the squared norm \u210b(n) is a positive definite matrix.\n\t\n\t\n\tBy orthogonality, the polynomials P(x,n)'s satisfy the following three-term recurrence\n\trelation:\n\t\n    xP(x,n) = P(x,n+1) + B(n) P(x,n) + C(n) P(x,n-1)\n\n\twhere B(n), C(n) \u2208 M_N(\u2102) and n \u2265 1.\n\tNotice that B(n) and C(n) satisfy \n\t\n    B(n)=X(n)-X(n+1),    C(n)= \u210b(n) \u210b(n-1)^-1,\n\n\twhere  X(n) is the one-but-leading coefficient of P(x,n) and \u210b(n) as in (<ref>).\n\tMoreover, for n \u2265 2, let Y(n) denotes the second-but-leading coefficient of P(x,n). Then\n\t\n    Y(n)=Y(n+1)+B(n)X(n)+C(n).\n\n\t\n\tIn <cit.>, the authors studied difference\u2013differential relations for a specific class of MVOPs associated with the weight W(x)=e^-v(x)e^xAe^xA^\u2217, where x \u2208\u211d, v(x) is a scalar polynomial of even degree, and A is a constant matrix. There is a way of obtaining information about the matrix orthogonal polynomials by investigating two mutually adjoint operators \ud835\udc9f and \ud835\udc9f^\u2020. If v(x) is a polynomial of degree two, in addition to \ud835\udc9f and \ud835\udc9f^\u2020, there exists a second order differential operator D having the MVOPs as eigenfunctions. It turns out that \ud835\udc9f, \ud835\udc9f^\u2020 and D generate a finite dimensional Lie algebra which is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the oscillator group. The Casimir operator for this algebra is given explicitly and used to obtain information of the MVOPs.\n\tIn this work, we solve the analogous problem for Laguerre-type weights. This case is more involved than the previous one due to the structure of the associated Lie algebra and the non-diagonality of certain formulas that involve W.\n\t\n\tIn the scalar case, this problem is closely related to <cit.>. Here Ismail proposed to study the finite dimensionality of certain Lie algebra generated by a pair of differential operators which are mutually adjoint respect to a Laguerre-type weight. More precisely, given the scalar weight w_1(x)=x^\u03b1e^-\u03d5(x) with x>0,  \u03b1>1 and differential operators\n\t\n    \ud835\udc9f_1,n=x\u2202_x +x B_n(x),     \ud835\udc9f_2,n=-x\u2202_x + x B_n(x)+x\u03d5'(x),\n\n\twhere {B_n} is a sequence of scalar polynomials, the problem asks to prove that \u201cThe Lie algebra generated by \ud835\udc9f_1,n and \ud835\udc9f_2,n is finite dimensional if and \tonly if \u03d5 is a polynomial\u201d.\n\t\n\tIn this paper we provide a partial answer to this problem in the context of matrix valued orthogonal polynomials. We give an explicit matrix valued weight W^(\u03bd)_\u03d5(x) =x^\u03bd e^-\u03d5(x) W^(\u03bd)_pol(x), where W^(\u03bd)_pol(x) is a matrix polynomial depending on \u03bd, and differential operators \n\t\n    \ud835\udc9f = \u2202_x x + x(A-1),   \ud835\udc9f^\u2020 = -\u2202_x x - (1+\u03bd+J)+x\u03d5'(x)-x.\n \n\tIn this case, we prove that the Lie algebra generated by is finite dimensional if and only if \u03d5 is a polynomial.\tAs a consequence, this solves <cit.> when B_n(x)=-1 for all n\u2208\u2115.\n\t\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Outline and main results\n\n\t\n\tIn Section 2 we recall some preliminaries. In particular, we introduce the left and right Fourier algebras related to the sequence of monic MVOPs.\n\t\n\tIn Section 3 for a given analytic function \u03d5 on a neighborhood of the interval [0,\u221e), we introduce a Laguerre type weight W^(\u03bd)_\u03d5 and the operators \ud835\udc9f , \ud835\udc9f^\u2020 and prove that they are mutually adjoint with respect to W^(\u03bd)_\u03d5(x). For the MVOPs {P_n} respect to W^(\u03bd)_\u03d5,\n\twe find discrete operators M,  M^\u2020 associated to \ud835\udc9f, \ud835\udc9f^\u2020 respectively, given by the relations M \u00b7 P_n = P_n \u00b7\ud835\udc9f and M^\u2020\u00b7 P_n = P_n \u00b7\ud835\udc9f^\u2020.\n\t\n\tIn Section 4 we study the Lie algebra \ud835\udd24_\u03d5 generated by the differential operators \ud835\udc9f, \ud835\udc9f^\u2020. We prove that \ud835\udd24_\u03d5 is finite dimensional if and only if \u03d5 is a polynomial. Also, for this family of Lie algebras {\ud835\udd24_\u03d5} we obtain that \ud835\udd24_\u03d5=\u2102^2\u2295\ud835\udd25 and \ud835\udd25 is a solvable Lie algebra with nilradical of codimension one. Moreover, we obtain a classification of this family of Lie algebra up to isomorphisms.\n\t\n\tIn Section 5 we give an explicitly expression for \ud835\udc9f, \ud835\udc9f^\u2020, M and M^\u2020 in the case \u03d5(x)=x.\tIn this case, we also find a symmetric second-order differential operator D which have {P_n} as eigenfunctions. We describe the Lie algebra \ud835\udc9c generated by \ud835\udc9f, \ud835\udc9f^\u2020 and D, \ud835\udc9c=\ud835\udcb5_\ud835\udc9c\u2295 [\ud835\udc9c,\ud835\udc9c] where \ud835\udcb5_\ud835\udc9c=2 and [\ud835\udc9c,\ud835\udc9c] is isomorphic to SL(2,\u2102). Also, we obtain some relations between \u210b_n, B_n and C_n. \n\t\n\tIn Section 6, we consider the polynomials R(x,n)=K_n P(x,n)e^xA \n\twhere P(x,n) are the MVOPs associated with the weight W^(\u03bd) and\n\tK_n certain lower triangular matrices. Using the operator D,\n\twe show that the matrix entries of R_n can be put in terms of \n\tgeneralized Laguerre polynomials  and a family of constants \u03be(n,i,j)'s. \n\tFinally, we give two-terms recursions for the constants \u03be(n,i,j)'s \n\tand for the squared norm \u210b_n.\n\t\n\tFinally, in Section 7, in the case A=- \u2211_k=1^N-1 E_k+1,k, and \u03b4^k>0 \n\tsatisfying two non-linear conditions (related to Pearson's equations),  we show that the constants \u03be(n,i,j)'s are written in terms of dual Hanh polynomials.\n\t\n\t\n\n\u00a7 PRELIMINARIES\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tThis section presents the left and right Fourier algebras associated with the sequence of monic MVOPs, as developed by Casper and Yakimov in <cit.>. The results discussed in this section have been previously covered in a more comprehensive context in <cit.>.\n\t\n\tLet Q(x,n) be a function Q:\u2102\u00d7\u2115_0 \u2192 M_N(\u2102) such that Q(x,n) is a rational function of x for fixed n. A differential operator of the form\n\t\n    =\u2211_j=0^n \u2202_x^j F_j(x),     \u2202_x^j := d^jdx^j,\n\n\twhere F_j:\u2102\u2192 M_N(\u2102) is a rational function of x, acts on Q from the right by\n\t\n    (Q\u00b7)(x,n)  = \u2211_j=0^n (\u2202_x^jQ)(x,n)   F_j(x).\n\n\t\n\tThe algebra of all differential operators of the form (<ref>) will be denoted by \u2133_N.  In addition to the right action by differential operators, we also consider a left action on Q by difference operators on the variable n. For j\u2208\u2124, let \u03b4^j be the discrete operator which acts on a sequence A:\u2115_0 \u2192 M_N(\u2102) by\n\t\n    (\u03b4^j \u00b7 A)(n)=A(n+j).\n\n\tHere we assume that the value of a sequence at a negative integer is equal to zero. For given sequences A_-\u2113,\u2026,A_k, a discrete operator of the form\n\t\n    M=\u2211_j=-\u2113^k A_j(n) \u03b4^j,\n\n\tacts on Q from the left by\n\t\n    (M \u00b7 Q)(x,n)    = \u2211_j=-\u2113^k A_j(n)   (\u03b4^j\u00b7 Q)(x,n) = \u2211_j=-\u2113^k A_j(n)   Q(x,n+j).\n\n\t\n\tWe shall denote the algebra of difference operators (<ref>) by \ud835\udca9_N. As in <cit.> we define:\n\t\n\t\tThe left and right Fourier algebras are given by:\n\t\t\n    \u2131_L(P)   ={ M\u2208\ud835\udca9_N \u2203 \u2208\u2133_N,  M\u00b7 P = P\u00b7}\u2282\ud835\udca9_N,\n    \u2131_R(P)   ={\u2208\u2133_N \u2203  M\u2208\ud835\udca9_N,  M\u00b7 P = P\u00b7}\u2282\u2133_N.\n\n\t\n\t\n\tThe definition of the Fourier algebras directly implies a connection between the elements of \u2131_L(P) and \u2131_R(P). Moreover, the map\n\t\n    \u03c6\u2131_L(P) \u2192\u2131_R(P),     defined by    M\u00b7 P = P \u00b7\u03c6(M),\n\n\tis an algebra isomorphism. In <cit.> this map is called the generalized Fourier map. More precisely, M_1M_2\u00b7 P = P \u00b7\u03c6(M_1)\u03c6(M_2) for all M_1,M_2\u2208\u2131_L(P). On the other hand, by the definition of \u03c6, we have that M_1M_2\u00b7 P = P\u00b7\u03c6(M_1M_2).\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tIn this context, the three term recurrence relation (<ref>) can be written as\n\t\t\n    xP = P\u00b7 x = L\u00b7 P,     where    L=\u03b4 + B(n) + C(n)\u03b4^-1.\n\n\t\tTherefore x\u2208\u2131_R, L\u2208\u2131_L and \u03c6(L)=x. For every polynomial v \u2208\u2102[x], we have\n\t\t\n    P\u00b7 v(x) =P\u00b7 v(\u03c6(L))= v(L)\u00b7 P.\n\n\t\n\t\n\tOn of the crucial results from <cit.> is the existence of an adjoint operation \u2020 in the Fourier algebras \u2131_L(P) and \u2131_R(P) as described in <cit.>. To define the adjoint operation in \u2131_L(P), we initially observe that the algebra of difference operators \ud835\udca9_N has a \u2217-operation defined as follows:\n\t\n    ( \u2211_j=-\u2113^k A_j(n)  \u03b4^j )^\u2217 = \u2211_j=-\u2113^k A_j(n-j)^\u2217 \u03b4^-j,\n\n\twhere A_j(n-j)^\u2217 is the conjugate transpose of A_j(n-j).
