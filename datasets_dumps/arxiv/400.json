The set of all n-by-1 column vectors is identified with the set of all ordered n-tuples with entries in \u2102 and thus denoted by \u2102^n. If x \u2208\u2102^n, then x_i denotes the ith entry of x. The n-by-n identity matrix is denoted by I = I_n and e_k denotes the kth column of I.\n\nGiven A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n, we let \n\n    \n  * \u03c3(A) denote the spectrum (i.e., multiset of eigenvalues) of A;\n    \n  * A_(k) denote the (n-1)-by-(n-1) principal submatrix obtained by deleting the kth row and kth column of A); and\n    \n  * A^\u2217 denotes the conjugate transpose of A.\n\n\nIf A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n and B \u2208\ud835\uddac_m, then the direct sum of A and B, denoted by A \u2295 B, is defined by \n\n    A \u2295 B =[ A 0; 0 B ].\n\n\nIf U \u2208\ud835\uddac_n, then U is called unitary if U^* U = I. If A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n, then A is called normal if A^* A = A A^*. A matrix A is normal if and only if there is a unitary matrix U and a diagonal matrix D such that A = U D U^* <cit.>.\n\nThe field (of values) or numerical range of A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n), denoted by F(A), is defined by F(A) = { x^*A x | x^*x = 1 }\u2286\u2102. A general reference for the field is <cit.>.\n\nIf S = {\u03bb_1,\u2026,\u03bb_n }\u2282\u2102 (repetitions allowed), then the convex hull of S is denoted by S = (S).\n\nThe following well-known properties will be useful in the sequel: \n\n\n \n    fvprops\n        If A = [a_ij] \u2208\ud835\uddac_n and B \u2208\ud835\uddac_m, then:\n     \n            \n            \n  *  \u03c3(A) \u2286 F(A) <cit.>; \n            \n  *  F(A) = (\u03c3(A)), whenever A is normal <cit.>; \n            \n  * ds F ( A\u2295 B ) = (F(A) \u222a F(B)) <cit.>;  \n            \n  *  F(A_(k)) \u2286 F(A), \u2200  k \u2208{1,\u2026, n } <cit.>; and\n            \n  * F(A) is convex <cit.>.\n    \n\n\n\nFor completeness, we give a proof of Property 1.2.11 <cit.>, which generalizes part <ref>, given that it is ubiquitous in the literature; the proof-strategy suggested by Horn and Johnson is tedious; and ideas presented in the demonstration will be used in the sequel. \n\nTo this end, let \u03b1 = {\u03b1_1, \u2026, \u03b1_m } be a nonempty subset of {1, \u2026, n} (if \u03b1 = \u2205, then F(A[\u03b1]) = \u2205\u2286 F(A)) and denote by A[\u03b1] the m-by-m matrix whose (i,j) entry is a_\u03b1_i, \u03b1_j, 1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 m. If P:= [ e_\u03b1_1     \u22ef e_\u03b1_m ], then\n\n    a_\u03b1_i, \u03b1_j\n        = e_\u03b1_i^\u22a4 A e_\u03b1_j\n        = [ P^\u22a4 A P]_ij,\n\ni.e., A[\u03b1] = P^\u22a4 A P. \n\n\nIf z \u2208 F(A[\u03b1]), then z = x^*F(A[\u03b1])x, where x^* x = 1. If y:=Px, then y^*y=x^*P^\u22a4 Px = x^*I_m x= x^*x=1. Furthermore,\n\n    z = x^* A[\u03b1] x = x^* P^\u22a4 A P x=(Px)^*APx = y^*Ay \u2208 F(A),\n \ni.e, F(A[\u03b1]) \u2286 F(A).\n\n\nIf A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n(\u2102), then A is called convexoid if F(A) = (\u03c3(A)). Johnson <cit.> gave the following characterization of convexoid matrices.\n\n\n\n    convexoid\n        If A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n(\u2102), then A is convexoid if and only if A is normal or there is a unitary matrix U such that \n        \n    U^\u2217 A U = [ A_1   0;   0 A_2 ],\n\n        where A_1 is normal and F(A_2) \u2286 F(A_1).\n\n\nBy fvprops(<ref>), if A is normal and \u03bb_1,\u2026,\u03bb_n are its eigenvalues (repetitions included), then F(A) = (\u03bb_1,\u2026,\u03bb_n). Without loss of generality, we may label the vertices as \u03bb_1,\u2026, \u03bb_d, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 n. Notice that \n\n    \u2202 F(A) = \u22c3_k=1^d (\u03bb_k,\u03bb_k+1),\n \nwhere, for convenience, d + 1 := 1. We say that F(A_(k)) is inscribed in F(A) if F(A_(k)) \u2229(\u03bb_k,\u03bb_k+1)\u2205, \u2200 k \u2208{1,\u2026,d}. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MAIN RESULT\n\n\n\n\n    rotevec\n        Let Av= \u03bb v,  where v \u2260 0 and v_k \u2260 0. If v_k = rexp(i \u03b8), where \u03b8\u2208 (-\u03c0,\u03c0], then w:= exp(-i\u03b8)v is an eigenvector such that v _2 =  w _2 and w_k > 0.\n\n\n\n    The conclusion that w is an eigenvector with the same length as v follows from the fact that |exp(-i\u03b8)| = 1. Lastly, notice that w_k = exp(-i\u03b8) (rexp(i \u03b8)) = r > 0.\n\n\n\n\n    projection\n        Let \u03b1 = {\u03b1_1, \u2026, \u03b1_m } be a nonempty subset of {1, \u2026, n}, let P:= [ e_\u03b1_1     \u22ef e_\u03b1_m ], and let y \u2208\u2102^n be any vector such that y_k  = 0 whenever k \u2209\u03b1. If x:= P^\u22a4 y \u2208\u2102^m, then y = Px and y^\u2217 y = x^\u2217 x.\n\n\n\n    Since PP^\u22a4 = \u2211_k=1^m e_\u03b1_ke_\u03b1_k^\u22a4, it follows that \n    \n    Px = P(P^\u22a4 y) = (P P^\u22a4) y = ( \u2211_k=1^m e_\u03b1_ke_\u03b1_k^\u22a4) y = \u2211_k=1^m e_\u03b1_k y_\u03b1_k.\n\n    If z := \u2211_k=1^m e_\u03b1_k, then z_k = 0 whenever k \u2209\u03b1. Thus, y = Px and \n    \n    y^\u2217 y = (Px)^\u2217 (Px) = x^\u2217 P^\u22a4 P x = x^\u2217 I_m x = x^\u2217 x,\n\n    as desired.\n\n\n\n\n    main\n        If A is convexoid, then F(A_(k)) is inscribed in the polygon \u2202 F(A), \u2200 k \u2208{1,\u2026,n}.\n\n\n\nIn view of fvprops<ref> and convexoid, it suffices to consider the case when A is normal.\n\nTo this end, if A is normal, then there is a diagonal matrix D = (\u03bb_1,\u2026,\u03bb_n) and a unitary matrix U such that A = UDU^*. \n\nLet \u03bb_i and \u03bb_j be adjacent vertices of the polygon \u2202(\u03bb_1,\u2026,\u03bb_n), let v := U e_i, and let w := Ue_j. Note that v^\u2217 v = w^\u2217 w = 1 and v^\u2217 w = w^\u2217 v = 0. We distinguish the following cases:\n\n\n  * v_k = 0 or w_k =0. If \n\n    \u03b3 := {1,\u2026,n }\\{k} = {\u03b3_1,\u2026, \u03b3_n-1},\n\n\n    P := [   e_\u03b3_1       \u22ef e_\u03b3_n-1 ],\n \nand x := P^\u22a4 v, then v = Px and x^\u2217 x = 1 by projection. Thus, \n\n    \u03bb_i = v^\u2217 Av = (Px)^\u2217 A (Px) = x^\u2217 P^\u22a4 A P x = x^\u2217 A_(k) x \u2208 F(A_(k)),\n\ni.e., F(A_(k)) \u2229(\u03bb_i-1,\u03bb_i)\u2205 and F(A_(k)) \u2229(\u03bb_i,\u03bb_i+1)\u2205 (if i=1, then i-1 := d). \n\nSimilarly, if w_k = 0, then \u03bb_j \u2208 F(A_(k)). If v_k = w_k = 0, then the line-segment (\u03bb_i,\u03bb_j)\u2286 F(A_(k)) by fvprops<ref>. \n    \n\n  * v_k  0 and w_k  0. By rotevec, it may be assumed, without loss of generality, that v_k > 0 and w_k > 0. If \n\n    \u03b1 := \u2213 w_k/\u221a(v_k^2 + w_k^2) and \u03b2 := \u00b1 v_k/\u221a(v_k^2 + w_k^2),\n\nthen \u03b1 and \u03b2 are nonzero reals such that \u03b1^2 + \u03b2^2 = 1. If u := \u03b1 v + \u03b2 w, then \n\n    u_k = \u03b1 v_k + \u03b2 w_k = \u2213 v_k w_k/\u221a(v_k^2 + w_k^2) + \u00b1 v_k w_k/\u221a(v_k^2 + w_k^2) = 0\n\nand, since v^\u2217 v = w^\u2217 w = 1 and v^\u2217 w = w^\u2217 v = 0, it follows that\n\n    u^\u2217 u = (\u03b1 v^\u2217 + \u03b2 w^\u2217)(\u03b1 v + \u03b2 w) = \u03b1^2v^\u2217 v + \u03b1\u03b2 v^\u2217 w + \u03b2\u03b1 w^\u2217 v + \u03b2^2 w^\u2217 w = \u03b1^2 + \u03b2^2 = 1\n\nand \n\n    u^\u2217 A u \n           = (\u03b1 v^\u2217 + \u03b2 w^\u2217) (\u03b1 A v + \u03b2 Aw)                                                   \n       = (\u03b1 v^* + \u03b2 w^*)(\u03b1\u03bb_i v + \u03b2\u03bb_j w)                                         \n       = \u03b1^2 \u03bb_i v^\u2217 v + \u03b1\u03b2 v^\u2217 w + \u03b2\u03b1 w^\u2217 v + \u03b2^2 \u03bb_jw^\u2217 w  \n       = \u03b1^2 \u03bb_i + \u03b2^2 \u03bb_j.\n\nBecause \u03b1^2 + \u03b2^2 = 1, \u03b1^2 > 0, and \u03b2^2 > 0, it follows that u^\u2217 A u lies in the interior of the line-segment (\u03bb_i,\u03bb_j). Finally, if x := P^\u22a4 u \u2208\u2102^n-1, where \u03b3 and P are defined as in (<ref>) and (<ref>), respectively, then u = Px and x^\u2217 x = 1 (by projection) and \n\n    \u03b1^2 \u03bb_i + \u03b2^2 \u03bb_j = u^\u2217 A u = x^\u2217 P^\u22a4 A P x = x^\u2217 A_(k) x \u2208 F(A_(k)).\n\nThus, F(A_(k)) \u2229(\u03bb_i,\u03bb_j)\u2205.\n\nIn all cases, F(A_(k)) \u2229(\u03bb_k,\u03bb_k+1)\u2205, \u2200 k \u2208{1,\u2026,d}.  \n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are two possible choices for \u03b1 and \u03b2, the convex combination \u03b1^2 + \u03b2^2 = 1 is unique. Therefore, in the case that v_k  0 and w_k  0, F(A_(k)) intersects the interior of the line segment (\u03bb_i,\u03bb_j) at a single point.\n\n\n\n\nIf \n\n    U =\n    [     1/2  \u221a(3)/2       0       0;     1/2 -\u221a(3)/6       0  \u221a(6)/3;     1/2 -\u221a(3)/6  \u221a(2)/2 -\u221a(6)/6;     1/2 -\u221a(3)/6 -\u221a(2)/2 -\u221a(6)/6;         ],\n\nthen U^\u22a4 U = I_4.
