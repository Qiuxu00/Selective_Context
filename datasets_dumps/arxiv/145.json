However, it is still a challenging problem to efficiently construct additive codes that outperform linear codes, especially those with greater distance than linear codes of the same length and dimension.\n\t\tTo advance this problem, this paper focuses on constructing additive codes that outperform linear codes using quasi-cyclic codes and combinatorial methods.\n\t\tFirstly, we propose a lower bound on the minimum symplectic distance of 1-generator quasi-cyclic codes of index even.  \n\t\tFurther, we get many binary quasi-cyclic codes with large symplectic distances utilizing computer-supported combination and search methods, all corresponding to good quaternary additive codes. Notably, 15 additive codes have greater distances than best-known quaternary linear codes in Grassl's code table (bounds on the minimum distance of quaternary linear codes http://www.codetables.de) for the same lengths and dimensions. Moreover, employing a combinatorial approach, we partially determine the parameters of optimal quaternary additive 3.5-dimensional codes with lengths from 28 to 254.\n\t\tFinally, as an extension, we also construct some good additive complementary dual codes with larger distances than best-known quaternary linear complementary dual codes in the literature.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tquasi-cyclic codes, symplectic bound, additive codes, optimal, additive complementary dual codes.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\tOne of the most significant problems in coding theory is constructing good error-correcting codes. \n\tAfter decades of efforts, scholars have constructed a large number of linear codes with suitable parameters, Grassl et al. summarized those results and established an online code table <cit.> of best-known linear codes over small finite fields \ud835\udd3d_q, q\u2264 9.\n\tUnlike linear codes, additive codes are closed under vector addition but not necessarily closed under scalar multiplication. All linear codes can be considered as also additive codes, but additive codes are not necessarily linear. Therefore, theoretically, additive codes may have better parameters than additive codes. In addition, additive codes also have critical applications in quantum information <cit.>, computer memory systems <cit.>, deep space communication <cit.>, and secret sharing <cit.>. Thus, it is crucial to construct good additive codes, especially ones with better performance than best linear codes.\n\t\n\t\n\tQuaternary additive codes were the first to receive scholarly attention, given the links to communications, electronic devices, computers, etc.\n\tIn <cit.>, Blokhuis and Brouwer determined the parameters of optimal quaternary additive codes of lengths not more than 12, some of which have higher information rates than optimal linear cases.\n\tAfterward, much work has been done on quaternary additive codes with small lengths <cit.> or low dimensions <cit.>, resulting in a general determination of the parameters of quaternary additive codes of lengths up to 15 and a complete determination of the parameters of 2.5-dimensional optimal quaternary additive codes. Meanwhile, additive complementary dual codes[In this paper, all additive complementary dual codes are respected to trace Hermitian inner product, which can be simplified to Hermitian inner products, in linear case <cit.>. All linear complementary dual codes (LCD codes) are respected to Hermitian inner product.] (ACD codes) have also attracted a great deal of scholars' attention owing to their utility in constructing maximal-entanglement entanglement-assisted quantum codes <cit.>, and their application in resisting side-channel attacks <cit.>.\n\t\n\tQuasi-cyclic codes are an interesting class of linear codes that exhibit good performance in constructing new or recorded linear codes in <cit.>. \n\tWith appropriate mappings established, quasi-cyclic code can be used to construct good additive codes <cit.>.\n\tHowever, there is still a lack of practical approaches to constructing additive codes using quasi-cyclic codes, which makes it challenging to construct good additive codes with quasi-cyclic codes.\n\tThis paper proposes a lower bound on the minimum symplectic distance of 1-generator quasi-cyclic codes of index even and several methods for the combinatorial construction of additive codes. Further, we construct many good quaternary additive codes and ACD codes, which perform better than linear counterparts in Grassl's code table <cit.> or best-known LCD codes in <cit.>.\n\t\n\t\n\tThis paper is structured as follows.\n\tIn the next section, we give some of the foundations used in this paper. In Sec. <ref>, we propose a lower bound on the minimum symplectic distance of 1-generator quasi-cyclic codes of index even. In Sec. <ref>, \n\twe give some combinations, enhancements and derivations of additive codes, and construct a large number of good additive codes.\n\tIn Sec. <ref>, we discuss the construction of ACD codes, and obtain 20 ACD codes that are better than the quaternary LCD codes in the literature.\n\tFinally, in Sec. <ref>, we discuss our main results and future research directions.\n\tThe parameters of linear or additive codes in this paper are computed by algebra software Magma <cit.>.\n\t\n\n\u00a7 PRELIMINARIES\n\n\tThis section presents the fundamentals of additive codes and quasi-cyclic codes to advance the development of this paper. \n\tFor more details, we refer the reader to standard textbooks <cit.>.\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Additive codes\n\n\t\n\tLet p be a prime, and \ud835\udd3d_q is the finite field of order q, where q = p^r for some positive integer\n\tr.\n\tFor u\u20d7=(u_0,\u2026, u_n-1)\u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^n, the Hamming weight of u\u20d7 is \n\tw_H(u\u20d7)=#{i | u_i\u22600, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n-1}.

We define two maps, \u03d5 and \u03a6, as follows. For x,y\u2208\ud835\udd3d_q, then\n\t\u03d5(x,y)=x+wy, where w is primitive of \ud835\udd3d_q^2.\n\tFor v\u20d7=(v_0,\u2026, v_2n-1) \u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^2n,  \u03a6(v\u20d7)=(\u03d5(v_0,v_n),\u03d5(v_1,v_n+1),\u22ef,\u03d5(v_n-1,v_2n-1)).\n\tClearly, mapping \u03a6 is a one-to-one mapping, and there is w_H(\u03a6(v\u20d7))=w_s(v\u20d7).\n\t\n\tLet G_s denote generator matrix of \ud835\udc9e_s, then \u03a6(G_s) can generate additive code \ud835\udc9e_a have parameters (n,k/2,d_s)_q^2. Similarly, \u03a6^-1(\ud835\udc9e_a)=\ud835\udc9e_s.  Therefore, a symplectic code \ud835\udc9e_s with parameters [2n,k,d_s]^s_q is equivalent to an additive code (n,k/2 ,d_s)_q^2. \n\tNotably, Calderbank et al. <cit.> also proved that the symplectic inner product and trace Hermitian inner product are equivalent.\n\tTherefore, a symplectic LCD [2n,k,d_s]_q^s code is also an ACD\n\tcode with parameters (n,k/2 ,d_s)_q^2. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tIn general, for an additive (n,k/2 ,d_s)_q^2 code, k is even, if \n\tthe best linear code is [n,  k/2 ,< d_s]_q^2, then we regard (n,k/2 ,d_s)_q^2 as better than linear counterpart in a strong sense. When k is odd, for specific n and d_s, if best linear code is [n, \u230ak/2\u230b ,d_s]_q^2, we can also regard (n,k/2 ,d_s)_q^2 have better than linear, with higher information rate.  \n\tHowever, there is also a particular case in which the corresponding best linear codes are [n, \u230ak/2\u230b,d_1]_q^2 and [n, \u2308k/2\u2309,d_2]_q^2, and d_2 < d_s < d_1. In this case, we can consider that (n,k/2,d_s)_q^2 fills the distance gap of best linear codes.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Cyclic codes and quasi-cyclic codes\n\n\t\n\tLet \ud835\udc9e be an [n,k]_q code over \ud835\udd3d_q, \ud835\udc9e  is cyclic provided that for all  \ud835\udc1c=(c_0, c_1, \u22ef, c_n-1) \u2208\ud835\udc9e, the cyclic shift  \ud835\udc1c^'=(c_n-1, c_0, \u22ef, c_n-2) \u2208\ud835\udc9e.\n\tConsidering each codeword \ud835\udc1c as a coefficients vector of polynomial  \n\t\ud835\udc1c(x)= \u2211_i=0^n-1 c_i x^i-1 in \ud835\udd3d_q[x], \n\tthen \ud835\udc9e corresponds to a principal ideal in the quotient ring  \n\t\u211d_q,n=\ud835\udd3d_q[x] /\u27e8 x^n-1\u27e9, \n\twhich is generated by a unique monic non-zero polynomial g(x) of degree n-k. \n\tWe call g(x) the generator polynomial of cyclic code \ud835\udc9e, and \ud835\udc9e also can be denoted as \u27e8 g(x) \u27e9. \n\tThe parity check polynomial of \ud835\udc9e is h(x)=(x^n-1) / g(x). \n\tThe Euclidean dual code \ud835\udc9e^\u22a5_e of \ud835\udc9e is also a cyclic code with  generator polynomial\n\tg^\u22a5_e(x)=h\u0303(x)=x^(h(x)) h(x^-1).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tA linear code \ud835\udc9e of length n\u2113 over \ud835\udd3d_q is called a quasi-cyclic code of index \u2113 if  \ud835\udc1c=(c_0, c_1, \u2026, c_n\u2113-1)  is a codeword of \ud835\udc9e,  then \ud835\udc1c^'=(c_n-1,c_0, \u2026, c_n-2, c_2n-1, c_n, \u2026, c_2n-2, \u2026, c_n\u2113-1, c_(n-1)\u2113,  \u2026,  c_n\u2113-2) is also a codeword. \n\tCirculant matrices are basic components in the generator matrix for quasi-cyclic codes.

For additive codes of dimension greater than 3.5, a computational search would be an efficient way to construct additive codes with suitable parameters.\n\t\tAn efficient search approach is to choose the generator polynomial of best cyclic code as g(x). It is more probable to find codes with considerable distance even if the lower bound of the distance derived from Theorem <ref> and <ref> is not large.

Moreover, employing a combinatorial approach, we partially determine the parameters of optimal quaternary additive 3.5-dimensional codes with lengths from 28 to 254.\n\t\n\tConsider the finite field of order 2 by \ud835\udd3d_2 and the finite field of order 4 by \ud835\udd3d_4 = {0, 1, w, w^2}, where w^2 +w + 1 = 0. In addition, 1_\ud835\udc27, \ud835\udc30_\ud835\udc27, \ud835\udc30^2_\ud835\udc27 denote all 1, w and w^2 vectors of length n, respectively. \n\t\n\tBefore starting construction, we introduce additive codes' basic derivation and augmentation.\n\t\n\t\tIf \ud835\udc9e_a is an additive code of parameters (n,k,d)_q^2, then the following additive codes also exist:(1) For i\u2265 1, (n+i,k,\u2265 d)_q^2 (Additive Extend); (2) For i\u2264 d, (n-i,k,\u2265 d-i)_q^2 (Additive Puncture); (3) For i \u2264 k, (n-i,k-i,\u2265 d)_q^2 (Additive Shorten); \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe difference between generator matrix of additive and linear codes is that the number of rows of additive codes is 2k. For the reason that puncture and extension can be considered extensions and deletions of the codewords. Therefore, the extent and puncture of additive and linear codes have similar properties, so (1) and (2) hold.\n\t\tSince the proof of Theorem 1.5.7 (i) in <cit.> is also valid for additive codes, the puncture of \ud835\udc9e_a is equivalent to the shorten of \ud835\udc9e_a^\u22a5.\n\t\tBy puncturing \ud835\udc9e_a^\u22a5, one can get an additive code (n-1,k)_q^2, which satisfies that at least any d-1 columns are linearly independent.
