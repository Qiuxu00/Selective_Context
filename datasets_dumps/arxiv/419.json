A more general and powerful version of the resonance method was introduced by Soundararajan in <cit.> which was successful in finding extreme values of zeta and L functions. There have been many further developments and applications of the method, we refer readers to <cit.> and references therein. \n\nIn this paper, we study the extreme values of Dirichlet polynomials with multiplicative coefficients. \nLet  be the set of completely multiplicative functions f with |f(n)|=1 for all n \u2208. Let \n\n    D_N(t) : =  D_f,  N(t)= 1/\u221a(N)\u2211_n\u2a7d N f(n) n^it.\n\n\n\nLet D_f, N(t) be defined as above. Let \u03b4, \u03b3\u2208 (0, 1) be fixed. Let T=N^C(N) where C(N) satisfies 2/\u03b4\u2a7d C(N)\u2a7d (log N)^\u03b3 . Then for sufficiently large N, we have\n\n    sup_|t|\u2a7d T |D_f, N(t)| \u2a7eexp( \u221a((1-\u03b4)log T/loglog T)) ,\n\nuniformly for all f \u2208. \n\n\nA Steinhaus random multiplicative function (n) is a completely multiplicative function and (p) are independent random variables taking value on the complex unit circle for all primes p. \nAnother way to state Theorem\u00a0<ref> is that  is the family of all possible Steinhaus random multiplicative functions. \nIn particular, for all , and all large N,\n\n    sup_|t|\u2a7d N^C(N)|1/\u221a(N)\u2211_n\u2a7d N(n) n^it| \u2a7eexp( \u221a((1-\u03b4)log T/loglog T)) \u2a7eexp( \u221a(( 1-\u03b4/1+\u03b3)C(N) log N/loglog N)).\n\nThis improves the lower bound obtained in a recent interesting paper <cit.> where they have (loglog N)^4 instead of our loglog N in the denominator. Our result is stronger also in the sense that the bound holds uniformly for all f, rather than just almost all f as in <cit.>. We remark that the multiplicativity of (n) is crucial here. Without it, the extreme values are significantly smaller (see <cit.> for more discussions). We refer readers to recent results in extreme values of sums of random multiplicative functions to <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PROOF OF THEOREM\u00a0<REF>\n\nOur method was initialed by Soundararajan in <cit.>. \nWe first set up the framework by using the resonance method. \n Let \n    R(t):= \u2211_n\u2a7d Xr_f(n)n^it  where   X= T^1-2\u03b4/3,\n\n where r_f(n) is a function defined on integers. \nAs in <cit.>,  we define \u03a6: \u211d\u2192\u211d to be a smooth function, compactly supported in [1/2, 1], \nwith 0 \u2a7d\u03a6(y) \u2a7d  1 for all y, and \u03a6(y)=1 for 5/8\u2a7d y\u2a7d 7/8.\nLet \n\n    M_1(R, T): = \u222b_-\u221e^+\u221e |R(t)|^2\u03a6(t/T) dt,\n\nand \n\n    M_2 (R, T): =   \u222b_-\u221e^+\u221e |R(t)|^2\u03a6(t/T) |D_N(t)|^2 dt .\n\n Then\n\n    sup_|t|\u2a7d T |D_N(t)| \u2a7e\u221a(M_2(R, T)/M_1(R, T)).\n\n\nThe quantity M_1(R, T) has a nice expression.  \n\nWe have \n\n    M_1(R, T) = T\u03a6\u0302(0)  (1 + O(T^-1) ) \u2211_n\u2a7d X |r_f(n)|^2.\n\n\n\nThe result is in <cit.>. The key point is that partial integration gives that for any positive integer \u03bd,\n\n    \u03a6\u0302(y) \u226a_\u03bd |y|^-\u03bd\n\n which leads to the expression (<ref>). \n\nNow we focus on estimating M_2(R, T). \n\n    M_2(R, T) = T/N\u2211_m, n\u2a7d N\u2211_a, b \u2a7d X f (n)  f (m) r_f(a)  r_f(b)\u03a6\u0302 (T    log (ma/nb)).\n\nWe split M_2(R, T) into two parts by considering two cases ma =nb or ma\u2260 nb.\n\n    M_2(R, T) = T/N\u03a6\u0302(0)\u2211_m, n\u2a7d N\n    a, b \u2a7d X\n     ma = nb  f (n)  f (m) r_f(a)  r_f(b)  +  T/N\u2211_m, n\u2a7d N\n    a, b \u2a7d X\n     ma \u2260 nbf (n)  f (m) r_f(a)  r_f(b)\u03a6\u0302 (T    log (ma/nb))\n\nWe first consider the off-diagonal terms, i.e., ma\u2260 nb. By our assumption, T = N^C(N)\u2a7e N^2/\u03b4. So in this case, we have\n\n    T| logma/nb| \u2a7e T1/NX = T^2\u03b4/3/N\u2a7e T^\u03b4/6.\n\nApply (<ref>) to get that \n    |\u03a6\u0302 (T    log (ma/nb))| \u226a_\u03b4 T^-10 .\n\nThis leads to\n\n    |   T/N\u2211_m, n\u2a7d N\n    a, b \u2a7d X\n     ma \u2260 nbf (n)  f (m) r_f(a)  r_f(b)\u03a6\u0302 (T    log (ma/nb))| \n    \u226a_\u03b4    T/N\u2211_m, n\u2a7d N1 ( \u2211_a \u2a7d X |r_f(a)|)^2 T^-10\n    \u226a_\u03b4     T^-9N  X \u2211_n \u2a7d X |r_f(n)|^2\n    \u226a_\u03b4     T^-7\u2211_n\u2a7d X |r_f(n)|^2 ,\n\nwhere in the second step we use Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality.\nThis shows that the off-diagonal terms are negligible.\n\nSo in the next steps, we just need to consider the diagonal terms in (<ref>), i.e\nthe sum involving terms ma = nb. We use the following trick to get rid of dependence on f. Set  \n    r_f(n) =  f(n) r (n),\n where r is a non-negative multiplicative function to be chosen later, independent of f.\nBy noticing that |f(n)|=1, the sum involving diagonal terms is the same as \n\n    T/N\u03a6\u0302(0)\u2211_m, n\u2a7d N\n    a, b \u2a7d X\n     ma = nb   r(a)  r(b).\n\nBy the estimates on off-diagonal terms and  (<ref>), we have \n\n    M_2(R, T)/M_1(R, T)=  1/N\u2211_m, n\u2a7d N\n    a, b \u2a7d X\n     ma = nb   r(a) r(b)   /\u2211_n\u2a7d X r(n)^2 + O_\u03b4(1/T) .\n\nNow our theorem would immediately follow from Hough's work <cit.> on large character sums.\nIn particular, his work would imply\n\n    1/N\u2211_m, n\u2a7d N\n    a, b \u2a7d X\n     ma = nb   r(a)  r(b)   /\u2211_n\u2a7d X r(n)^2 \u2a7eexp( (2+o(1)) \u221a(log X/loglog X)).\n\nFor completeness, we present Hough's work. \nLet g = (a, b), h = (m ,n), a = a'g, b = b'g then (a', b' ) = 1 and m=hb', n=ha'. With this parametrization, we have\n\n    \u2211_m, n\u2a7d N\n    a, b \u2a7d X\n     ma = nb   r(a)r(b)    \u2a7e\u2211_a', b' \u2a7d X \n     (a', b') = 1r(a')r(b')\u2211_g \u2a7dX/max(a', b')\n     (g, a'b')=1 r^2(g) \u2211_h \u2a7dN/max(a', b')  1\n       \u2a7e(1+o(1)) N \u2211_a', b'\u2a7dmin{X, N}\n    (a',b')=1r(a')r(b') a'b'/max(a',b')^3\u2211_g \u2a7dX/max(a', b')\n     (g, a'b')=1 r^2(g).\n\nWe replace the sum over g by multiplicativity and Rankin's trick, for any \u03b1>0,\n\n    \u2211_g \u2a7dX/max(a', b')\n     (g, a'b')=1 r^2(g) =    \u2211_(g, a'b')=1 r^2(g) -  \u2211_g > X/max(a', b')\n     (g, a'b')=1 r^2(g)\n     =    \u220f_p \u2224 a'b'(1+r(p)^2) + O((X/max(a', b'))^-\u03b1\u220f_p\u2224 a'b'(1+r(p)^2p^\u03b1) ).\n\nWe also have, by multiplicativity of r(n), \n\n    \u2211_n\u2a7d Xr(n)^2\u2a7d\u220f_p(1+r(p)^2).\n\nCombining the above two estimates and (<ref>), we have that the main term in (<ref>) is at least\n\n    M: =\n    \u2211_a', b'\u2a7dmin(X, N)\n    (a', b')=1r(a')r(b')a'b'/max(a', b')^3/ \u220f_p|a'b'(1+r(p)^2),\n\nand the error term is (let z:= min(X, N)) at most\n\n    E: =  \u220f_p(1+r(p)^2)^-1 X^-\u03b1\u2211_a', b'\u2a7d z\n     (a',b')=1r(a')r(b')(a'b')^1+\u03b1/(a'b')^3/2\u2211_(g, a'b')=1r(g)^2 g^\u03b1.\n\nNext, we make a choice of the resonator r(n). Set \u03bb= \u221a(log X loglog X ). \nWe choose r(n) supported square-free integers and let \n\n    r(p)= \n    \u03bb/\u221a(p)log p ,   \u03bb^2\u2a7d p \u2a7dexp((log\u03bb)^2)    \n    \n    0 ,    otherwise.\n\nWe define a multiplicative function t(n) supported on squarefree integers by setting t(p)= r(p)/1+r(p)^2. We have the following estimates borrowed from <cit.>. \n Uniformly in z\u2a7e 1, \n\n    \u2211_m_1, m_2 \u2a7d z \n     (m_1, m_2) =1 t(m_1) t(m_2) m_1 m_2/max(m_1 , m_2)^3\u2a7e1/log z(\u2211_m\u2a7d zt(m)/\u221a(m))^2.\n\n  Assume that z>exp(3\u03bbloglog\u03bb) with \u03bb = \u221a(log Xloglog X). As X \u2192 +\u221e, we have\n\n    \u2211_m_1, m_2 \u2a7d z \n     (m_1, m_2) =1 t(m_1) t(m_2) m_1 m_2/max(m_1 , m_2)^3\u2a7eexp((1+o(1)) \u03bb/log\u03bb).\n\n\n\n\nAssume that z>exp(3\u03bbloglog\u03bb) with \u03bb = \u221a(log Xloglog X) and \u03b1 = (log\u03bb )^-3. Then \n\n    X^-\u03b1\u2211_m_1, m_2\u2a7d z\n     (m_1, m_2)=1r(m_1)r(m_2)/(m_1m_2)^1/2 - \u03b1\u2211_(d, m_1m_2)=1 r(d)^2d^\u03b1/ (\u2211_m\u2a7d Xt(m)/\u221a(m))^2\u2211_d r(d)^2\u2a7dexp(-(1+o(1)) 32 log X/(loglog X)^4).\n\n\n\n\nBy our assumption that C(N)\u2a7d (log N)^\u03b3 and X= T^1-2\u03b4/3= N^C(N)(1-2\u03b4/3), we have log N > 3 \u03bbloglog\u03bb. And clearly, log X > 3\u03bbloglog\u03bb for all large X. Apply Lemma\u00a0<ref> to get that \n\n    \u2211_a', b'\u2a7dmin(X, N)\n    (a', b')=1r(a')r(b')a'b'/max(a', b')^3/ \u220f_p|a'b'(1+r(p)^2) \u2a7eexp( (2+o(1)) \u221a(log X/loglog X)).\n\nBy Lemma\u00a0<ref>, we find that  the ratio E/M tends to zero as X\u2192 +\u221e, where the quantities M,  E are defined in (<ref>) and (<ref>).\nThus we complete the proof of (<ref>).\n\n\nCombining (<ref>), (<ref>), (<ref>) and recalling that X= T^1-2\u03b4/3, we are done.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Acknowledgement\n The authors would like to thank Kannan Soundararajan for  interesting discussions.
