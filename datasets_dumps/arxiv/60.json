It is based on the necessity to include higher-form symmetries and the corresponding extended objects in the description of quantum field theories <cit.>.\nRestricting to four-dimensional QFTs, the simplest way to proceed consists in classifying the one-form symmetries in supersymmetric and conformal theories (SCFTs). A seminal paper that allowed for such a classification has been <cit.> where a general prescription was given in terms of the spectrum of mutually local Wilson and 't\u00a0Hooft lines <cit.>.\nSuch a prescription was initially based on the existence of a Lagrangian description for the SCFT under investigation. In absence of a Lagrangian description it is nevertheless possible to use other tools, coming from supersymmetry, holography and/or branes.\nThese constructions have allowed to figure out the one-form symmetry structure of many 4d non-Lagrangian SCFTs constructed in various ways\n<cit.>.\n\n\nA class of theories that has not been deeply investigated so far are SCFTs with 24 supercharges, i.e. \ud835\udca9=3 conformal theories. Such models have been predicted\nin <cit.>, and then found in  <cit.>.\nMany generalizations have been then studied by using various approaches\n <cit.>.\n A key role in the analysis of <cit.> is based on the existence, in the string theory setup, of non-perturbative extended objects that generalizes the notion \nof orientifolds, the S-folds (see <cit.> for their original definition). From the field theory side, the projection implied by such S-folds on \ud835\udca9=4 SYM has been associated to the combined action of an R-symmetry and an S-duality twist on the model at a fixed value of the holomorphic gauge coupling, where the global symmetry is enhanced by opportune discrete factors. Four possible \u2124_k have been identified, corresponding to k=2, 3, 4 and 6. While the \u2124_2 case corresponds to the original case of the orientifolds <cit.>, where actually the holomorphic gauge coupling does not require to be fixed, the other values of k correspond to new projections that can break supersymmetry down to \ud835\udca9=3.\nThe analysis has been further refined in <cit.>, where the discrete torsion, in analogy with the case of orientifolds, has been added to this description.\nIn this way, it has been possible to achieve a classification of such \ud835\udca9=3 S-folds SCFT in terms of the Shephard\u2013Todd complex reflection groups.\n\n\nThe goal of this paper consists in classifying one-form symmetries for such theories, constructing the lattices of lines \nand identifying which models possess non-invertible symmetries.\nThe main motivation behind this expectation is that for the rank-2 S-folds, in absence of discrete torsion, the SCFTs enhance to \n\ud835\udca9=4 SYM <cit.> where these properties are present.\n\nOur strategy adapts the one presented in <cit.> to S-fold setups. There, the spectrum of lines is built from the knowledge of the electromagnetic charges of massive states in a generic point of the Coulomb branch. These charges are read from the BPS quiver, under the assumption that the BPS spectrum is a good representative of the whole spectrum of electromagnetic charges. In the case of S-folds however such a BPS quiver description has not been worked out and \nwe extract the electromagnetic charges of dynamical particles from the knowledge of \nthe (p,q)-strings  configurations in the Type IIB setup <cit.>. The main assumption behind the analysis is that such charges are a good representative of the electromagnetic spectrum. \n\nWe proceed as follows.\nFirst we choose an \ud835\udca9=3 theory constructed via an S-fold projection of Type IIB. This consists in having N D3-branes, together with their images, on the background of an S-fold. At a generic point of the Coulomb branch, the corresponding low energy gauge dynamics corresponds to a U(1)^N gauge theory where each U(1) is associated to a D3.\nThen we list all (p,q)-strings that can be stretched between D3-branes and their images. They have electric and magnetic charges with respect to U(1)^N.\nEventually we run the procedure of <cit.>. This consist in finding all the lines that are genuine, i.e. have integer Dirac pairing with the local particles, modulo screening by the dynamical particles. This gives the lattice of possible charges, then the different global structures correspond to maximal sub\u2013lattices of mutually local lines.\n\n\n\nOur results are summarized in <Ref>. In the first column, one finds the type of S-fold projection that has been considered. \nSuch projections are identified by the two integers k and \u2113 in S_k,\u2113.\nThe integer k corresponds to the \u2124_k projection while the second integer \u2113 is associated to the discrete torsion.\nThen, when considering an S_k,\u2113 S-fold on a stack of N D3-branes the complex reflection group associated to such a \nprojection is G(k,k/\u2113,N). \nIn the second column, we provide the one-form symmetry that we found in our analysis, and in the third, the number of inequivalent line lattices that we have obtained. The last column specifies whether there exist cases that admit non-invertible symmetries.\nIndeed, here we find that in some of the cases there exists a zero-form symmetry mapping some of the different line lattices, that are therefore equivalent.\nFurthermore in such cases we expect the existence of non-invertible symmetries obtained by combining the zero-form symmetry with a suitable gauging of the one-form symmetry.\n\nA remarkable observation strengthening our results regards the fact that our analysis reproduces the limiting  G(k,k,2)\ncases, where supersymmetry enhances to \ud835\udca9=4  with  \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3), \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(5) and \ud835\udd24_2 gauge groups for k=3, 4 and 6 respectively.\nAnother check of our result is that it matches with the cases G(3,1,1) and G(3,3,3), where an \ud835\udca9=1 Lagrangian picture has been worked out in <cit.>.\n\n\n\nNote added: When concluding this paper, the reference <cit.> appeared on arXiv. There, they study  the classification of zero, one and two-form symmetries \nin \ud835\udca9=3 S-fold SCFTs. Their analysis is holographic, along the lines of the construction of <cit.> for \ud835\udca9=4 SYM. We have checked that our results are in agreement with their predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 GENERALITIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Global structures from the IR\n\n\n\n\nThe strategy adopted here, as already discussed in the introduction, is inspired by the one of <cit.>.\nThe main difference is that instead of using BPS quivers, not yet available for our S-folds,\nwe take advantage of the type IIB geometric setups and probe the charge spectrum with (p,q)-strings \u2013 the bound state of p fundamental  strings F1 and q Dirichlet strings D1.[In order to provide the IR spectrum of line operators of the SCFTs from this UV perspective, we assume the absence of wall-crossing.\nWhile such an assumption is a priori motivated by the high degree of supersymmetry,  a posteriori it is justified by \nthe consistency of our results with the literature.] \n\nDespite this difference, the rest of the procedure is the one of <cit.> which we now summarize.\nDenote as \n\n    \u03b3^i = (e^(i)_1, m^(i)_1; \u2026; e^(i)_r, m^(i)_r)\n\na basis vector of the electromagnetic lattice of dynamical state charges under the U(1)_e^r \u00d7 U(1)_m^r gauge symmetry on the Coulomb branch.\nThe spectrum of lines can be determined by considering a general line \u2112 with charge\n\n    \u2113=(e^(l)_1, m^(l)_1; \u2026; e^(l)_r, m^(l)_r)   .\n\nThis is a genuine line operator if the Dirac pairings with all dynamical states \u03a8 are integer:\n\n    \u27e8\u03a8, \u2112\u27e9\u2208\u2124    \u2200 \u03a8  .\n\nThis can be rephrased as the condition\n\n    \u2211_j=1^r e^(i)_j m^(l)_j - m^(i)_j e^(l)_j \u2208\u2124    \u2200  i   .\n\n\nFurthermore, inserting a local operator with charge \u03b3_i on the worldline of a line with charge \u2113 shifts its charge by \u03b3_i.\nTherefore if a line with charge \u2113 appears in the spectrum then a line with charges \u2113 +  \u2211 k_i \u03b3_i with k_i \u2208\u2124\nmust also appear. \nWhen classifying the spectrum of charges of the line operators of a QFT it is then useful to consider  the charges \u2113 modulo these insertions of local states.\nThis gives rise to equivalence classes of charges with respect to the relation:\n\n    \u2113\u223c\u2113 + \u03b3_i\n    \t    \u2200  i  .\n\nBorrowing the nomenclature of <cit.>,\u00a0we will refer to such identification as screening and we will\nwork with each equivalence class by picking one representative. \nThe genuine lines after screening form a lattice. In general two such lines are not mutually local and a choice of global structure corresponds to a choice of a maximal sublattice of mutually local lines.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Charged states in S_k,l-folds\n\n\n\n\nWe aim to determine the electromagnetic charges of the local states generated by (p,q)-strings stretched between (images of) D3-branes in presence of an S-fold. \nThe S-fold background of Type IIB string theory consist of a spacetime \u211d^4 \u00d7 (\u211d^6/\u2124_k) where the _k quotient involves an S-duality twist by an element \u03c1_k \u2208 SL(2,) of order k, where k=2,3,4,6. For k>2 the value of the axio-dilaton vev is fixed by the requirement that it must be invariant under the modular transformation associated to \u03c1_k. The matrices \u03c1_k and the corresponding values[In our convention, an SL(2,\u2124) transformation of the axio-dilaton \u03c4\u2192 (a\u03c4 + b) / (c\u03c4 +d) relates to a matrix \u03c1_k = [ d c; b a ]. We also have S = [  0 -1;  1  0 ] and T = [ 1 0; 1 1 ].] of \u03c4 are given in Table <ref>.\n\n\nA stack of N D3-branes probing the singular point of the S-fold background engineer an \ud835\udca9=3 field theory on the worldvolume of the stack of D3-branes. It is useful to consider the k-fold cover of spacetime, and visualize the N D3-branes together with their (k-1)N images under the S_k-fold projection. We are going to label the m-th image of the i-th D3-brane with the index i_m, where i=1,\u2026,N and m=1,\u2026,k.\n\nUnder the S-fold projection, the two-form gauge fields of the closed string sector B_2 and C_2 transform in the fundamental representation:\n\n    ([ B_2; C_2 ])\n    \t\u2192\u03c1_k  ([ B_2; C_2 ])   .\n\nConsistently, the (p,q) strings charged under these potentials are mapped to (p',q') where:\n\n    (p'\u00a0q') =   (p\u00a0q)\u00b7\u03c1_k^-1 .\n\nWe denote a state associated to a (p,q) connecting the i_m-th D3-brane and the j_n D3-brane as:\n\n    |p,q\u27e9 _i_m, j_n= |-p,-q\u27e9 _j_n , i_m  ,\n\nwhere we identity states with both opposite charges and orientation.\n\nFirst, strings linking branes in the same copy of \u211d^6/ \u2124_2 transform as follows:\n\n    |p,q\u27e9 _i_m, j_m\u2192\u03b6_k^-1 |p',q'\u27e9_i_m+1,j_m+1  ,\n\nwhere (p',q') are related to (p,q) by (<ref>) and \u03b6_k is the primitive k-th root of unity. These states always collectively give rise to a single state in the quotient theory, with charges:\n\n    D3_iD3_j   :   (0,0 ; \u2026 ;p,q^i-th; \u2026; -p,-q^j-th; \u2026 ; 0,0)   .\n\n\nAn important ingredient we need to add to our picture is the discrete torsion for B_2 and C_2 <cit.>. In presence of such a discrete torsion, a string going from the i_m-th brane to the j_m+1-th brane should pick up an extra phase which depends only on its (p,q)-charge and the couple (\u03b8_NS,\u03b8_RR). More precisely, one expects that the S-fold action can be written as follows <cit.>:[We thank Shani Meynet for pointing out <cit.> to us.]\n\n    |p,q\u27e9_i_mj_m+1\u2192\u03b6_k^-1 e^2\u03c0 i (p\u03b8_NS+q\u03b8_RR)|p',q'\u27e9_i_m+1j_m+2\u00a0,\n\nwhere again (p',q') are related to (p,q) by (<ref>). For i\u2260 j, this always leads to the following state in the projected theory <cit.>:[The action on (p,q) involves \u03c1_k^-1, see (<ref>). In writing (<ref>) however, we measure the charge with respect to the brane in the chosen fundamental domain, hence the appearance of \u03c1_k instead of its inverse.]\n\n    D3_iD3_j^\u03c1  :  \t(0,0 ; \u2026 ;p,q^i-th; \u2026; -(p\u00a0q)\u00b7\u03c1_k^j-th; \u2026 ; 0,0)   .\n\n\nNote that this is the only case that might not lead to any state in the quotient theory when i=j, i.e. when a string links a brane and its image. When the quotient state exists, it has charges\n\n    D3_iD3_i^\u03c1  :  \t(0,0 ; \u2026 ;(p\u00a0q)-(p\u00a0q)\u00b7\u03c1_k^i-th;  \u2026 ; 0,0)   .\n\n\nAnalogously, strings twisting around the S-fold locus n-times pick up n-times the phase in (<ref>). \n\nA last remark is that discrete torsion allows some strings to attach to the S-fold if the latter has the appropriate NS and/or RR charge. If this is the case, the state is mapped as in (<ref>):\n\n    |p,q\u27e9_S_k  i_m\u2192|p^',q^'\u27e9_S_k  i_m+1  ,\n\nand provides the following charge in the projected theory:\n\n    S_k D3_i   :   (0,0 ; \u2026 ;p,q^i-th;  \u2026 ; 0,0)   .\n\n\nThese rules are illustrated and details on discrete torsion are provided in the remaining of this section for orientifolds and S-folds separately.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The case with k=2: orientifolds\n\n\n\nIn this subsection we apply the formalism described above for orientifolds and reproduce the spectrum of strings known in the literature.\n\nThe matrix \u03c1_2 is diagonal, therefore the two p and q factors can be considered independently. In this case the field theory obtained after the projection is Lagrangian and can be studied in perturbative string theory with unoriented strings. Discrete torsion takes value in (\u03b8_NS,\u03b8_RR)\u2208_2 \u2295_2, giving four different choices of O3-planes related by SL(2,\u2124) actions <cit.>, see <Ref>.\n\n\nThe orientifold action is then recovered from (<ref>) and (<ref>) with \u03b6_2 = -1. First, we have\n\n    |p,q\u27e9_i_1 j_1\u2192 - |-p,-q\u27e9_ i_2 j_2  = -|p,q\u27e9_ j_2 i_2  .\n\nFor the strings that stretch from one fundamental domain of \u211d^6/\u2124_2 to the next, there are four cases depending on the values of \u03b8_NS and \u03b8_RR:\n\n    [                                        O3^-                                           :           |p,q\u27e9_i_1 j_2\u2192 -|p,q\u27e9_ j_1 i_2  ,;                                        O3^+                                           :     |p,q\u27e9_i_1 j_2\u2192 -e^p\u03c0 i |p,q\u27e9_j_1 i_2  ,;                                        O3^-                                           :     |p,q\u27e9_i_1 j_2\u2192 -e^q\u03c0 i |p,q\u27e9_j_1 i_2  ,;                                        O3^+                                           : |p,q\u27e9_i_1 j_2\u2192 -e^(p+q)\u03c0 i |p,q\u27e9_j_1 i_2  . ]\n\nIt is interesting to consider strings connecting one brane to its image, i=j. In the case of trivial discrete torsion, corresponding to the O3^--plane, all such strings are projected out. On the contrary, in the O3^+ case, an F1-string linking mirror branes survives the projection, while a D1-string similarly positioned is projected out. We also find strings that can attach to the different orientifolds following <cit.>:\n\n    O3^-   :  none  ,    \tO3^+   :  |0,1\u27e9_O3^+ i_m  ,    O3^-   :  |1,0\u27e9_O3^- i_m  ,   O3^+   :  |1,1\u27e9_O3^+ i_m  ,\n\nas well as bound states of these.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The cases with k>2: S-folds\n\n\nThe construction discussed above can be applied to S_k>2 in order to obtain the string states in the quotient theory. For k>2, the discrete torsion groups have been computed in <cit.>, the result being \u03b8_NS=\u03b8_RR\u2208_3 for the S_3-case and \u03b8_NS=\u03b8_RR\u2208_2 for the S_4-case. The S_6-fold does not admit non-trivial discrete torsion. It was also pointed out that, for the S_3-case, the choices \u03b8_NS=\u03b8_RR=1/3 and \u03b8_NS=\u03b8_RR=2/3 are related by charge conjugation; therefore everything boils down to whether the discrete torsion is trivial or not. Following the notation of <cit.>, we denote as S_k,1 the S-folds with trivial discrete torsion and as S_k,k the S-folds with non-trivial discrete torsion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before, the only states that might not lead to any state in the quotient theory are the strings linking different covers of \u211d^6/\u2124_k. These transform as follows:\n\n    [                                                        S_3,1                                                            :               |p,q\u27e9_i_1 j_m+1\u2192 e^-i2\u03c0/3|q-p,-p\u27e9_i_2 j_m+2  ,;                                                        S_3,3                                                            : |p,q\u27e9_i_1 j_m+1\u2192 e^-i2\u03c0/3e^im(p+q)2\u03c0/3 |q-p,-p\u27e9_i_2 j_m+2  ,;                                                        S_4,1                                                            :                 |p,q\u27e9_i_1 j_m+1\u2192 e^-i\u03c0/2 |-q,p\u27e9_i_2 j_m+2  ,;                                                        S_4,4                                                            :       |p,q\u27e9_i_1 j_m+1\u2192 e^-i\u03c0/2e^im(p+q)\u03c0 |-q,p\u27e9_i_2 j_m+2  ,;                                                        S_6,1                                                            :              |p,q\u27e9_i_1 j_m+1\u2192 e^-i\u03c0/3 |p-q  ,p\u27e9_i_2 j_m+2  .;                                                              ]\n\nThis shows that no state is projected out for S_3,1 and  S_3,3. Analogously to the orientifold cases, we project out some strings linking mirror branes: |p,q\u27e9_i_n i_n+2 in S_4,1 and S_4,4, and |p,q\u27e9_i_n i_n+3 in S_6,1 respectively.\n\nFinally, we get extra strings linking the S-fold to D-branes for the cases with discrete torsion. Following the discussion in <cit.>, we know that these S-folds admit all kinds of p and q numbers:\n\n    S_3,3  :   |p,q \u27e9_S_3,3 i_n  ,    S_4,4  :  |p,q\u27e9_S_4,4 i_n  .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Dirac pairing from (p,q)-strings\n\n\n\n\nHaving determined the states associated to (p,q)-strings that survive the S-fold projection we now analyze the electromagnetic charges of these states. It is useful to consider the system of a stack of D3-branes and an S_k,\u2113-fold on a generic point of the Coulomb branch. This corresponds to moving away the D3-branes from the S-plane. On a generic point of the Coulomb branch, the low energy theory on the D3-branes is a U(1)_i^N gauge symmetry, where each U(1)_i factor  is associated to the i-th D3-brane. The theory includes massive charged states generated by the (p,q)-strings studied in the previous section. A (p,q)-string stretched between the i-th and j-th D3-brane has electric charge p and magnetic charge q under U(1)_i as well as electric charge -p and magnetic charge -q under U(1)_j, and is neutral with respect to other branes.\nWe organize the charges under the various U(1)s in a vector:\n\n    (e_1, m_1; e_2,m_2; \u2026; e_N,m_N)\n\nwhere e_i and m_i are the electric and magnetic charge under U(1)_i, respectively. In this notation the charge of a string stretched between the i-th and j-th D3-brane in the same cover of \u211d^6/\u2124_2 has charge:\n\n    D3_iD3_j: (0,0;\u2026; p,q^i-th;0,0; \u2026;  -p,-q^j-th;\u2026 )   ,\n\nwhere the dots stand for null entries. We will keep using this notation in the rest of the paper.\nA (p,q)-string stretched between the i-th D3-brane and the l-th image of the j-th D3-brane imparts electromagnetic charges (p,q) under U(1)_i and charges - (p,q)\u03c1_k^l under U(1)_j. In formulas:\n\n    D3_iD3_j^\u03c1^l: (0,0;\u2026; p,q^i-th;0,0; \u2026;  -(p\u00a0q)\u00b7\u03c1_k^l^j-th;\u2026 )   .\n\n\nThe last ingredient for our analysis is given by the Dirac pairing between two states. Consider a state \u03a8 with charges e_i,m_i under U(1)_i and a state \u03a8' with charges e'_i,m'_i under U(1)_i. The pairing between F1 and D1-strings in Type IIB dictates that the Dirac pairing between these states is given by:\n\n    \u27e8\u03a8, \u03a8' \u27e9 = \u2211_i=1^N (e_i m'_i - m_i e'_i)   .\n\n\nBy using this construction we can reproduce the usual Dirac pairing of \ud835\udca9=4 SYM with ABCD gauge algebras. As an example we now reproduce the Dirac pairing of D_N, engineered as a stack of N D3-branes probing an O3^--plane. \nIn this case the allowed (p,q)-strings have the following charges:\n\n    D3_iD3_j: (0,0;\u2026; p,q^i-th;0,0; \u2026;  -p,-q^j-th;\u2026 )\n    \n       D3_iD3_j^\u03c1: (0,0;\u2026; p,q^i-th;0,0; \u2026;  p,q^j-th;\u2026 )\n\nThe states associated to (1,0)-strings correspond to the \ud835\udcb2 bosons while the states associated to (0,1)-strings correspond to magnetic monopoles \u2133. For each root \ud835\udcb2_i of D_N let \u2133_i be the corresponding coroot. More precisely if \ud835\udcb2_i is associated to a (1,0)-string connecting two D3-branes, then the coroot \u2133_i corresponds to the string (0,1) stretched between the same pair of D3-branes.\nThe only non-vanishing Dirac pairing is the one between a \ud835\udcb2_i boson and an \u2133_j monopole. This pairing between the simple (co)roots \ud835\udcb2_i and \u2133_j is given by the intersection between \ud835\udcb2_i and \ud835\udcb2_j, explicitly:\n\n    \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_i,\u2133_j \u27e9 = (A_D_N )_i,j  ,\n\nwhere A_D_N is the Cartan matrix of the D_N algebra, corresponding to an \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(2N) gauge theory. \nIndeed the intersection between F1 strings in the background of an O3^- reproduces the intersection of the roots of D_N. \nThe Dirac pairing (<ref>) reproduces the Dirac pairing of \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(2N) \ud835\udca9=4 SYM.\nSimilar constructions for O3^+, O3^-, and O3^+ lead to the B and C cases (while branes in absence of orientifold would give A). The corresponding gauge algebras are summarized in <Ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Lines in O3-planes\n\n\n\n\nBefore moving to new results, we illustrate our method with well understood O3-planes. Specifically, we consider placing N=2 D3-branes in the background of an O3^+-plane.\n\n\n\n\nIn this specific example, the F1-strings corresponding to elementary dynamical states in the quotient theory can be chosen to be |1,0 \u27e9_1_2 1_1 and |1,0 \u27e9_1_1 2_1. The first links the i=1 brane to its mirror (D3_1^\u03c1 D3_1) and the second links the i=1 to the i=2 brane (D3_1 D3_2). A pictorial representation of this setup is shown in Figure <ref>. In the notation of the previous section, they lead to \ud835\udcb2_i-bosons in the gauge theory with the following charge basis:\n\n    D3_1^\u03c1 D3_1   :  \tw_1 =  (2,0;0,0)   ,     D3_1 D3_2  :   w_2 =  (-1,0;1,0)   .\n\nThese generate the algebra \ud835\udd32\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2d(4) of electric charges. The elementary magnetic monopoles \u2133_i come from the D1-strings |0,1 \u27e9_O3^+ 1_1 and |0,1 \u27e9_1_1 2_1, and provide the following charges:\n\n    O3^+ D3_1  :   m_1  =  (0,1;0,0)   ,     D3_1D3_2  :    m_2 =  (0,-1;0,1)   .\n\nThis generates the algebra \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(5) of magnetic charges. Finally, the elementary (1,1)-strings leading to states in the quotient theory can be chosen to be |1,1 \u27e9_1_2 1_1 and |1,1 \u27e9_1_1 2_1, i.e. D3_1^\u03c1 D3_1 and D3_1D3_2 respectively. They provide dyons \ud835\udc9f_i:\n\n    D3_1^\u03c1 D3_1   :   d_1 =  (2,2;0,0)   ,    D3_1D3_2  :   d_2 =  (-1,-1;1,1)   ,\n\nwhich reproduces an \ud835\udd32\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2d(4) algebra. We will limit ourselves to considering the \ud835\udcb2-bosons and magnetic monopoles \u2133. Indeed, they generate the full lattice of electromagnetic charges admissible in the orientifold theory. See that\n\n    d_1 = w_1 + 2 m_1     d_2 = w_2 + m_2   .\n\nClearly, all other allowed (p,q)-charges can be reconstructed in this way. The Dirac pairing between these elementary electromagnetic charges reads\n\n    \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_1, \ud835\udcb2_2 \u27e9 = \u27e8\u2133_1, \u2133_2 \u27e9 = 0  ,\n    \t\t\n       \u27e8\u2133_1, \ud835\udcb2_2 \u27e9 = 1  ,\n    \t\t\n       \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_1,\u2133_1 \u27e9 =\u27e8\u2133_2,\ud835\udcb2_1 \u27e9 =\u27e8\ud835\udcb2_2,\u2133_2 \u27e9 = 2  .\n\n\nNow, introduce a line operator \u2112 with charge vector \u2113. It is convenient to express it in the basis of dynamical charges: \n\n    \u2113 = \u03b1_1 w_1 + \u03b1_2 w_2 + \u03b2_1 m_1 + \u03b2_2 m_2   ,\n\nwhere \u03b1_i and \u03b2_i to be determined. Screening with respect to \ud835\udcb2_1 and \ud835\udcb2_2 imposes\n\n    \u03b1_1 \u223c\u03b1_1  + 1   ,   \u03b1_2 \u223c\u03b1_2  + 1   ,\n\nrespectively, while screening with respect to \u2133_1 and \u2133_2 imposes\n\n    \u03b2_1 \u223c\u03b2_1  + 1   ,   \u03b2_2 \u223c\u03b2_2  + 1   .\n\nMutual locality with respect to the dynamical charges requires the quantities\n\n    [    \u27e8\u2112,  \ud835\udcb2_1 \u27e9 = - 2\u03b2_1 +2 \u03b2_2  ,                                    \u27e8\u2112,  \ud835\udcb2_2 \u27e9 =  \u03b2_1 - 2\u03b2_2     ,;     \u27e8\u2112,  \u2133_1 \u27e9 = 2\u03b1_1 - \u03b1_2    ,                                  \u27e8\u2112,  \u2133_2 \u27e9 =  -2 \u03b1_1 + 2\u03b1_2    , ]\n\nto be integers. All these constraints set\n\n    \u03b1_1 = e/2   \u03b1_2 = 0   ,   \u03b2_1 = 0    ,    \u03b2_2 = m/2   1   ,\n\nwith e,m=0,1. Linearity of the Dirac pairing then guarantees mutual locality with respect to the full dynamical spectrum. Thus, the charge of the most general line (modulo screening) must read:\n\n    \u2113_e,m = 1/2(2e, -m ; 0 , m)   .\n\n\nA choice of global structure consists in finding a set of mutually local lines. The mutual locality condition between two lines \u2112 and \u2112' with charges \u2113_e,m and \u2113_e',m' is given by:\n\n    \u27e8\u2112 , \u2112^'\u27e9 = 1/2 (-em^' +  e^' m) \u2208\u2124  .\n\nEquivalently:\n\n    em'-me' = 0  2  .\nWe find three such sets, each composed of a single line with non-trivial charge: \u2113_1,0, \u2113_0,1, or \u2113_1,1. In agreement with <cit.>, we find that the line with charge \u2113_1,0 transforms as a vector of \ud835\udd32\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2d(4) and the theory is USp(4). The line with charge \u2113_0,1 transforms as a spinor of \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(5) and corresponds to the global structure (USp(4)/\u2124_2)_0. The line with charge \u2113_1,1 transforms both as a vector and a spinor, and the gauge group is (USp(4)/\u2124_2)_1.\nMotivated by the match between our results (obtained through the procedure described above) and the global structures of Lagrangian theories <cit.>, in the next sections we use our method to analyze the line spectra of S-fold theories. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 LINES IN S-FOLDS WITH \ud835\udca9=4 ENHANCEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now derive the spectrum of mutually local lines for the gauge theories obtained with N=2 D3-branes in the background of an S_k,1 plane, in each case k=3, 4 and 6. More precisely, exploiting the strategy spelled out in Section <ref>, we first compute the electromagnetic charge lattice of local states generated by (p,q)-strings. From this we extract the possible spectra of lines and compare them with the ones obtained in an \ud835\udca9=4 Lagrangian formalism <cit.>, since these theories have been claimed to enhance to \ud835\udca9=4 SYM  <cit.>.\nMatching the spectra provides an explicit dictionary between the various lattices and corroborates the validity of our procedure. In section <ref> we will then generalize the analysis to the pure \ud835\udca9=3 S_k,\u2113 projections for any rank, thus providing the full classification for the one-form symmetries in all such cases.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Lines in \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3) from S_3,1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Dynamical states and their charges\n\n\nTwo D3-branes probing the singular point of the S_3,1-fold are claimed to engineer \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3) \ud835\udca9=4 SYM. The charges of states generated by (p,q)-strings stretching between D3_1 and D3_2 or its first copy (see Figure <ref>) are\n\n    D3_1 D3_2  :  (p,q;-p,-q)   ,    D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1 :   (p,q;q, q-p)   ,    D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1^2  :  (p,q;p-q, p)   .\n\n\n\n\n\nOne may also consider copies of the strings listed in Equation <ref> such as:\n\n    D3_1^\u03c1 D3_2^\u03c1  :  (-q,p-q;q,q-p)   ,\n\nas well as the strings going from one D3-brane to its own copies, for instance[In the absence of discrete torsion, these states have not been considered previously in the literature <cit.>, and we do here for the sake of consistency with the analysis of section <ref>. Note however that since their charge (which is the only feature that matters in order to derive line spectra) can be expressed as linear combinations of the charges of more conventional states, our results are independent of whether we consider them or not. ]\n\n    D3_1 D3_1^\u03c1  :  (2p-q,p+q;0,0)   .\n\n\n\n\nThe charges of a generic string D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1^2 in (<ref>) can be expressed in terms of D3_1 D3_2 and D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1 charges: \n\n    [     D3_1D3_2^\u03c1^2  :    (p,q;p-q,p)                                  =     q (1,0;-1,0) + (q-p)(0,1;0,-1);                                                                       +(p-q) (1,0;0,-1) +p (0,1;1,1)   , ]\n\nwhere the first two vectors on the RHS come from D3_1 D3_2 with p=1, q=0 and p=0, q=1 respectively, and the last two come from D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1 with p=1, q=0 and p=0, q=1 respectively. Acting with \u03c1_3, one can express all D3_1^\u03c1 D3_2^\u03c1 and D3_1^\u03c1^2 D3_2^\u03c1^2 charges in terms of D3_1 D3_2 charges. The charges D3_i D3_i^\u03c1 can also be expressed as linear combinations of D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1 and D3_2^\u03c1 D3_1^\u03c1 charges. All in all, we find that the charges of the strings D3_1 D3_2 and D3_1D3_2^\u03c1 form a basis of the lattice of dynamical charges.\n\nThe states corresponding to the \ud835\udcb2-bosons generate the \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3) algebra. One can take the strings D3_1D3_2 with p=1 and q=0 and D3_1D3_2^\u03c1 with p=0 and q=1 as representing a choice of positive simple roots. Their electromagnetic charge w reads:\n\n    w_1 = (1,0;-1,0)   ,      w_2 =(0,1;1,1)  .\n\nFurthermore, one can choose the strings D3_1D3_2 with p=0 and q=1 and D3_1D3_2^\u03c1 with p=-1 and q=-1 as generating the charge lattice of magnetic monopoles \u2133 of \ud835\udca9=4 SYM with gauge algebra \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3):\n\n    m_1 = (0,1;0,-1)   ,      m_2 =(-1,-1;-1,0)  .\n\nThe qualification of electric charges \ud835\udcb2 and magnetic monopoles \u2133 of the \ud835\udca9=4 theory makes sense since the Dirac pairing reads:\n\n    [ \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_1, \ud835\udcb2_2 \u27e9           = \u27e8\u2133_1, \u2133_2 \u27e9           =       0   ,; \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_1, \u2133_1 \u27e9           = \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_2, \u2133_2 \u27e9           =       2   ,;  \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_1,\u2133_2 \u27e9           =  \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_2,\u2133_1 \u27e9           =      -1   . ]\n\nIn <cit.>, it has been shown that these states correspond indeed to BPS states, and this is a strong check of the claim of the supersymmetry enhancement in this case. \n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Line lattices\n\n\nHaving identified the electromagnetic lattice of charges of (p,q)-strings we can now construct the spectrum of line operators and the corresponding one-form symmetries.\nIt is useful to consider the charge \u2113 = (e_1, m_1 ; e_2, m_2) of a general line \u2112 to be parameterized as follows:\n\n    [                                                           \u2113                                                           =                       \u03b1_1 w_1 + \u03b1_2 w_2 + \u03b2_1 m_1 + \u03b2_2 m_2;                                                                                                                       = (\u03b1_1-\u03b2_2,   \u03b1_2 + \u03b2_1-\u03b2_2 ;\n    \t  -\u03b1_1 +\u03b1_2-\u03b2_2,\u03b1_2 -\u03b2_1 )   . ]\n\nScreening with respect to w_i and m_i translates as the identifications:\n\n    \u03b1_i \u223c\u03b1_i+1   ,\n    \t  \u03b2_i \u223c\u03b2_i+1   .\n\nThe Dirac pairing between the generic line \u2112 with charge \u2113 given in  (<ref>)  and the states \ud835\udcb2 and \u2133 must be an integer, i.e.:\n\n    [      \u27e8\u2112,  \ud835\udcb2_1 \u27e9               =  2\u03b2_1 - \u03b2_2   ,                      \u27e8\u2112,  \ud835\udcb2_2 \u27e9               = -\u03b2_1 + 2\u03b2_2   ,;      \u27e8\u2112,  \u2133_1 \u27e9               = -2\u03b1_1 + \u03b1_2   ,                      \u27e8\u2112,  \u2133_2 \u27e9               =      \u03b1_1 - 2\u03b1_2 ]  \u2208  .\n\nMutual locality with respect to the other states then follows by linearity as soon as (<ref>) holds.\nCombining (<ref>) and (<ref>) we have\n\n    \u03b1_1 = - \u03b1_2 = e/3 ,  and  \u03b2_1 = -\u03b2_2 = m/3  ,\n\nfor e,m=0, 1, 2. Then, the charge of the most general line compatible with the spectrum of local operators modulo screening reads\n\n    \u2113_e,m =1/3  (\n    \t\t2e-m,  \n    \t\te+m;   \n    \t\t-e-m,  \n    \t\te-2m\n    \t)   .\n\nThese charges form a finite 3 \u00d7 3 square lattice. The Dirac pairing between two lines \u2112 and \u2112'  with charges \n\u2113_e,m and \u2113_e',m' is\n\n    \u27e8\u2112 ,  \u2112' \u27e9 =\n    \t2/3 (e m' - e' m)   .\n\nTwo lines \u2112 and \u2112' are mutually local if their Dirac pairing is properly quantized. \nIn our conventions this corresponds to the requirement that \u27e8\u2112 ,  \u2112' \u27e9 is an integer:\n\n    e' m - e m' = 0  3   .\n\n\nThe lattice of lines together with the mutual locality condition obtained in (<ref>)\nfully specifies the global structure of the S_3,1 SCFT of rank-2.\n\nOur result is equivalent to the one obtained in <cit.> from the Lagrangian description of \n\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3) \ud835\udca9=4 SYM theory. Let us first write the charges in (<ref>) as:\n\n    \u2113_e,m =  e  w_1- w_2/3 + m  m_1 - m_2/3  .\n\nNote that (w_1-w_2)/3 (respectively, (m_1 - m_2)/3) is a weight of the electric (respectively, magnetic) algebra \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3) with charge 1 under the center \u2124_3   of the simply-connected group SU(3). Therefore, the line \u2113_e,m corresponds to a Wilson-'t Hooft line of charge (e,m) under \u2124_3\u00d7\u2124_3.\n \nAs shown in <cit.>, there are four possible lattices of mutually local Wilson-'t Hooft lines specified by two integers i=0,1,2 and p=1,3.\nThe corresponding gauge theories are denoted (SU(3)/\u2124_p)_i and relate to the line spectra we have obtained as follows:\n\n    [                    SU(3)                        \u2194 {\u2113_0,0, \u2113_1,0, \u2113_2,0}  ,;            (SU(3)/\u2124_3)_0                        \u2194 {\u2113_0,0, \u2113_0,1, \u2113_0,2}  ,;            (SU(3)/\u2124_3)_1                        \u2194 {\u2113_0,0, \u2113_1,1, \u2113_2,2}  ,;            (SU(3)/\u2124_3)_2                        \u2194 {\u2113_0,0, \u2113_2,1, \u2113_1,2}  . ]\n\nIt follows from linearity and screening that each lattice in the S-fold picture is determined by a single non-trivial representative, that can itself be identified by two integers (e,m). For example, a possible choice is\n\n    (e,m)= (1,0),   (0,1),    (1,1),   (2,1)   .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Lines in  \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(5) from S_4,1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Dynamical states and their charges\n\n\nTwo D3-branes probing the singular point of the S_4,1-fold are claimed to engineer \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(5) \ud835\udca9=4 SYM. Following a reasoning similar to one of the S_3,1-fold case, we can write all string charges as linear combinations of two kinds of strings, say\n\n    D3_1 D3_2  :   (p,q;-p,-q)  ,    D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1 :  (p,q;-q,p)   .\n\nStates corresponding to the \ud835\udcb2-bosons of \ud835\udca9=4 SYM are generated by D3_1D3_2 with p=1 and q=0, and D3_1D3_2^\u03c1 with p=-1 and q=-1. Their charges are\n\n    w_1 = (1,0;-1,0)   ,      w_2 = (-1,-1;1,-1)   .\n\nThese states generate the algebra \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(5) with short and long positive simple roots w_1 and w_2, respectively. A possible choice of states corresponding to elementary magnetic monopoles \u2133 is D3_1D3_2 with p=-1 and q=1, and D3_1D3_2^\u03c1 with p=1 and q=0. The charges of these strings are:\n\n    m_1= (-1,1;1,-1)   ,    m_2 = (1,0;0,1)   ,\n\nwith m_1 the long and m_2 the short positive simple roots of the Langland dual algebra \ud835\udd32\ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2d(4). The Dirac pairings between \ud835\udcb2 and \u2133 are as expected:\n\n    [         \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_1, \ud835\udcb2_2 \u27e9                   =         \u27e8\u2133_1, \u2133_2 \u27e9                   =               0   ,;         \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_1, \u2133_1 \u27e9                   =         \u27e8\ud835\udcb2_2, \u2133_2 \u27e9                   = \u27e8\u2133_1, \ud835\udcb2_2 \u27e9 = 2   ,;        \u27e8\u2133_2 , \ud835\udcb2_1 \u27e9                   =                1  .                                         ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Line lattices\n\nWe begin by parametrizing the charge \u2113 of a general line \u2112 as:\n\n    \u2113   = \u03b1_1 w_1 + \u03b1_2 w_2+\u03b2_1 m_1 + \u03b2_2 m_2 \n    \t\n       = (\u03b1_1-\u03b1_2-\u03b2_1+\u03b2_2,  \u03b2_1-\u03b1_2 ; \n    \t\t-\u03b1_1+\u03b1_2+\u03b2_1,   -\u03b1_2-\u03b2_1+\u03b2_2)   .\n\nScreening with respect to the local states \ud835\udcb2 and \u2133 translates as:\n\n    \u03b1_i \u223c\u03b1_i + 1   ,   \u03b2_i \u223c\u03b2_i +1   .\n\nMutual locality with respect to the dynamical states generated by (p,q)-strings reads:\n\n    [     \u27e8\u2112,\ud835\udcb2_1 \u27e9            =     2\u03b2_1-\u03b2_2;     \u27e8\u2112,\ud835\udcb2_2 \u27e9            = -2 \u03b2_1 +2\u03b2_2;      \u27e8\u2112,\u2133_1\u27e9            =  -2\u03b1_1 +2\u03b1_2;     \u27e8\u2112,\u2133_2 \u27e9            =   \u03b1_1 - 2\u03b1_2;              ]  \u2208  .\n\nThis imposes \u03b1_1 = \u03b2_2 = 0 and \u03b1_2, \u03b2_1 \u22081/2, and therefore the charge of the most general line compatible with the spectrum of local states can be written as:\n\n    \u2113_e,m = e/2 w_2 + m/2 m_1 = 1/2 (-e-m ,-e+m; e+m, -e-m)   .\n\nThe Dirac pairing between two lines \u2112 and \u2112' with charges \u2113_e,m and \u2113_e',m' is:\n\n    \u27e8\u2112, \u2112' \u27e9 =  1/2 (e'm - em')    .\n\nTwo such lines are mutually local if their Dirac pairing if \u27e8\u2112, \u2112' \u27e9 is an integer, i.e.:\n\n    (e'm - em') = 0  2   .\n\nTherefore, the allowed lines form a finite 2\u00d7 2 square lattice parametrized by e,m=0,1, where the mutual locality condition is given by (<ref>). This reproduces the expected global structures of \ud835\udca9=4 \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(5) SYM. There are three possible choices of maximal lattices of mutually local lines which correspond to the three possible global structures of \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(5). The explicit mapping can be obtained by comparing the electromagnetic charges of the lines with the charges of the \ud835\udcb2 bosons and monopoles \u2133, along the lines of the analysis of above in the \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3) case. We obtain the following global structures:\n\n    [           Spin(5)                 \u2194 {\u2113_0,0, \u2113_1,0}  ,;           SO(5)_0                 \u2194 {\u2113_0,0, \u2113_0,1}  ,;           SO(5)_1                 \u2194 {\u2113_0,0, \u2113_1,1}  . ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Trivial line in \ud835\udd24_2 from S_6,1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Dynamical states and their charges\n\n\nTwo D3-branes probing the singular point of the S_6,1-fold are claimed to engineer \ud835\udd24_2 \ud835\udca9=4 SYM. The charges of states generated by (p,q)-strings are:\n\n    [         D3_1 D3_2                 :   (p,q;-p,-q)   ,       D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1                 :  (p,q;-q,p-q)   ,;     D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1^2                 :   (p,q;p-q,p)   ,     D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1^3                 :     (p,q;p,q)   ,;     D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1^4                 :   (p,q;q,-p+q)  ,     D3_1 D3_2^\u03c1^5                 : (p,q;-p+q,-p)   ,;              etc.                                                                                           ]\n\n\n\nAs shown in <cit.> and as before, one can choose a set of strings representing dynamical particles and generating the algebra \ud835\udd24_2. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Line lattice\n\nThe analysis of the charge spectrum in the case of the S_6,1-fold can be carried out along the lines of the previous sections. One can show that the only line that is mutually local with respect to the local states generated by (p,q)-strings modulo screening is the trivial line with charges \u2113 = (0,0;0,0). This is consistent with the enhancement to \ud835\udca9=4 with gauge algebra \ud835\udd24_2 because the center of the simply-connected G_2 is trivial, which implies the absence of non-trivial lines <cit.>. There is only one possible global structure, and the one-form symmetry is trivial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 LINES IN \ud835\udca9=3 S-FOLDS\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we generalize the procedure spelled out in the previous sections to S-folds theories of arbitrary rank, and later to the cases with non-trivial discrete torsion for the B_2 and C_2 fields. This allows us to classify the line spectrum for every \ud835\udca9=3 S-fold theory, and identify the one-form symmetry group as well as the allowed global structures for a given theory.\n\nThe basic ingredients needed in the analysis are the lattice of electromagnetic charges of local states and the Dirac pairing, both of which can be inferred from the Type IIB setup along the lines of the rank-2 cases studied in Section <ref>.\nAs already emphasized, we work under the assumption that the states generated by (p,q)-string form a good set of representatives of the electromagnetic charge lattice of the full spectrum. \n\nNote that it does not strictly make sense to talk about (p,q)-strings on the \u211d^4\u00d7\u211d^6/\u2124_k S-fold background because the S-fold projection involves an SL(2,\u2124) action which mixes F1 and D1 strings. This is analogous to the fact that in the orientifold cases it only makes sense to consider unoriented strings, since the orientifold action reverses the worldsheet parity (equivalently, it involves the element -\ud835\udd40_2 \u2208 SL(2,)). Nevertheless it makes sense to consider oriented strings (together with their images) on the double cover of the spacetime; this allows the computation of the electromagnetic charge lattice of local states and the Dirac pairing, as reviewed in Section <ref>. Similarly when dealing with S_k-folds we consider (p,q)-strings on the k-cover of the spacetime, and extract from this the charges of local states and the Dirac pairing. The spectrum of lines can then be obtained using the procedure of <cit.> reviewed in Section <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Lines in S_3,1-fold\n\n\n\nLet us first determine the lattice of electromagnetic charges of dynamical states. The charges generated by (p,q)-strings on the background of an S_3,1 fold are given by\n\n    D3_iD3_j^\u03c1^l  :   \n    \t(0,0; \u2026 ; p,q^i-th; \u2026;  \n    \t- (p     q)\u00b7\u03c1^l_3^j-th; \u2026 ; 0,0)   .\n\n\nThis expression is obtained from a (p,q)-string stretched between the i-th D3-brane and the l-th image of the j-th D3-brane. Recall that \u03c1_3 generates a _3 subgroup of SL(2,). A possible basis for the lattice of charges generated by (p,q)-strings is given by:\n\n    [                               w_1                                 =                  (1,0;-1,0;\u2026)   ,;                               w_2                                 =                   (0,1;1,1;\u2026)   ,;                               m_1                                 =                  (0,1;0,-1;\u2026)   ,;                               m_2                                 =                (-1,-1;-1,0;\u2026)   ,;                               P_i                                 = (1,0;0,0; \u2026 ;-1,0^i-th;0,0;\u2026)   ,;                               Q_i                                 = (0,1;0,0; \u2026 ;0,-1^i-th;0,0;\u2026)   , ]\n\nwhere w_i and m_i are the charges of the corresponding states in the rank-2 case, with all other entries set to 0. \nLet \ud835\udcab_i and \ud835\udcac_i be the states with charges P_i and Q_i respectively, for i=3,\u2026,N.\nNote that when the rank is N>2, it does not make sense to talk about \ud835\udcb2-bosons and magnetic monopoles \u2133 since the pure \ud835\udca9=3 theories are inherently strongly coupled and do not admit a Lagrangian description.\nNevertheless, we will denote \ud835\udcb2_i and \u2133_i the states with charges w_i and m_i respectively, by analogy with the above.\n\n\n\nThe charge \u2113 of a general line \u2112 can be written as the linear combination:\n\n    \u2113 = \u03b1_1 w_1 + \u03b1_2 w_2 + \u03b2_1 m_1 + \u03b2_2 m_2 + \u2211_i=3^N ( \u03b4_i P_i + \u03b3_i Q_i)   .\n\nBesides, screening translates into the identifications:\n\n    \u03b1_i \u223c\u03b1_i + 1   ,   \u03b2_i \u223c\u03b2_i +1 ,  \u03b4_i \u223c\u03b4_i+1   ,   \u03b3_i \u223c\u03b3_i+1   .\n\n\n\n\nLet us now analyze the constraints imposed on this line given by mutual locality with respect to the dynamical states generated by (p,q)-strings.

One finds that the integer lattice of charges associated to (p,q)-strings is fully occupied. \nTo see this notice that there are two states with the following charges:\n\n    [                                                          (1,0;0,0;0,0;\u2026)                                                                        = (p,q;p-q,p;0,0;\u2026)_|[  p=0; q=-1 ]\n    \t\t\t\t- (p,q;-q,p,0,0;\u2026)_|[ p=1; q=0 ]\u00a0,;                                                          (0,1;0,0;0,0;\u2026)                                                                        =                       (1,0;0,0;0,0;\u2026) \n    \t- (p,q;-p-q;0,0;\u2026)_|[ p=0; q=1 ];                                                                                                              - (p,q;-q,p;0,0;\u2026)_|[  p=0; q=-1 ]\u00a0. ]\n\nBy combining these states with \ud835\udcab_i and \ud835\udcac_i we can obtain states with electric or magnetic charge 1 with respect to the i-th brane, and all other charges set to zero. Let us now consider a general line \u2112 with charge \u2113 = (e_1,m_1; e_2,m_2,\u2026). Mutual locality with respect to the local states we have just discussed implies:\n\n    e_i, m_i \u2208  \u2200 i\u00a0,\n\nand the insertion of the same local states along the lines translates to the identification:\n\n    e_i \u223c e_i +1,      m_i \u223c m_i+1\u00a0.\n\nTherefore, the only allowed line modulo screening is the trivial line, with charge \u2113 = (0,0;0,0;\u2026). This implies that the one form symmetry group is trivial, and accordingly there is only one possible choice of global form.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Trivial line in the discrete torsion cases\n\n\n\nWe generalize the analysis discussed in the previous sections to the cases with non-trivial discrete torsion in the S_3,3-fold and S_4,4-fold. \n\nAs we argued in Section <ref> all the strings states that are present when the discrete torsion is trivial are also allowed when the discrete torsion is non-zero. Furthermore, there are strings ending on the S-fold itself, as discussed in Section <ref>. Thus, the lattice of charges of local states in the case of the S_3,3-fold and S_4,4-fold are generated by strings stretched between (images of) D3-branes \u2013 as in the cases with trivial discrete torsion \u2013 together with those additional strings. One can show that the integer lattice of electromagnetic charges of dynamical states is then fully occupied. Therefore, by a similar argument to the one used in the case of the S_6,1-fold in Section <ref>, the only line that is allowed is the trivial one, and the one-form symmetry group is 1 for the S_3,3-fold and S_4,4-fold with non-zero discrete torsion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 NON-INVERTIBLE SYMMETRIES\n\n\n\n\nWe now discuss the possible presence of non-invertible symmetries in S-fold theories. In the case of \ud835\udca9=4 theories, the presence of S-duality orbits can imply the existence of non-invertible duality defects which are built by combining the action of some element of SL(2,\u2124) and the gauging of a discrete one-form symmetry <cit.>.\n\n\nSimilar structures can be inferred from the S-fold construction. Consider moving one of the D3-brane along the non-contractible one-cycle of S^5/\u2124_k until it reaches its original position. The brane configurations before and after this are identical, and therefore the S-fold theories are invariant under this action. Going around the non-contractible one-cycle of S^5/\u2124_k in the case an S_k,l-fold involves an SL(2,)-transformation on the electric and magnetic charges e_i, m_i associated to the D3-brane that has been moved. Let \u03a3_k^i denote the process of moving the i-th D3-brane along the non-contractible cycle of an S_k,l-fold. The action of \u03a3_k^i on the charges is:\n\n    \u03a3_k^i: ( [ e_j; m_j ])\u2192{   \u03c1_k \u00b7( [ e_j; m_j ])    j=i\n    \t\t\n       ( [ e_j; m_j ])      j\u2260 i\n    \t\u00a0.\n    \t.\n\nThe charge lattice of dynamical states is invariant under \u03a3_k^i, while the set of line lattices can be shuffled. Consider for example the S_3,1-case with rank N=2. One can compute explicitly the following orbits:\n\n    (1,0) [<->]r   \n    \t\t(0,1) [<->]r    \n    \t\t(1,1)\n    \t    \n    \t\t(1,2) [loop above,looseness=8]   \u00a0,\n\nwhere the pairs (e,m) parametrize the maximal sub-lattice of mutually local lines as discussed in section (<ref>). Two line lattices connected by an arrow in (<ref>) are mapped to each other under proper combinations of \u03a3_3^i.\n\n\nThis theory enhances to \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3)  \ud835\udca9=4  SYM.  \nUsing the mapping  (<ref>) between the line lattices parametrized by (e,m) and the global structures of \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3), the formula (<ref>) reproduces the \ud835\udca9=4 orbits under the element ST\u2208 SL(2,\u2124). As shown in the literature <cit.>, this transformation can be combined with a proper gauging of the one-form symmetry to construct the non-invertible self-duality defects of \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd32(3) at \u03c4=e^2\u03c0 i/3. Therefore in our notation we expect the existence of non-invertible symmetries involving \u03a3_k^i for the lattices labeled by (e,m)=(1,0),(0,1),(1,1), and none in the (e,m)=(1,2) case.\n\nSimilarly, one can consider the orbits in the case of S_4,1 with N=2, where the SCFT enhances to \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(5) \ud835\udca9=4 SYM. By using the transformations \u03a3_4^i as above we find the following orbits\n\n    (0,1) \u27f7\n    \t\t(1,0)    \n    \t\t\t(1,1) [loop above,looseness=8]\n    \t\t\u00a0,\n\nwhere the pairs (e,m) parametrize the maximal sub-lattices of mutually local lines as discussed in section (<ref>).\n\nThese reproduce the \ud835\udca9=4 orbits under the element S\u2208 SL(2,). Again this transformation can be combined with a proper gauging of the one-form symmetry to construct the non-invertible self-duality defects of \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c(5) at \u03c4=i.\n\nMotivated by this match, one can expect that in the case of general rank, non-invertible symmetries will be present when multiple choices of maximal sub-lattices of mutually local lines are related by the transformations \u03a3_k^i, as above. \nThe orbits are:\n\n    S_3,1:\n    \t(1,0)\u27f7(0,1)\u27f7 (1,1)  \n    \t\t(1,2) [loop right,looseness=5]\n    \t\u00a0,\n    \t\n       S_4,1:\n    \t\t(0,1) \u27f7\n    \t\t(1,0)  \n    \t\t\t(1,1) [loop right,looseness=5]\n    \t\t   N=0 2\n    \n    \t\t(1,0)\u27f7 (1,1)  \n    \t\t\t(0,1) [loop right,looseness=5]\n    \t\t   N=1 2\n    \t\u00a0,\n\nwhere the pairs (r,s) parametrize the maximal sub-lattices of mutually local lines as in section <ref>.\n\n\nIn the S_6,1, S_3,3 and S_4,4-cases, there is only one possible global structure that is mapped to itself by the \u03a3_k^i transformations. \n\nBy analogy with the cases where there is \ud835\udca9=4 enhancement, we expect the existence of non-invertible symmetries when the transformations \u03a3_k^i map different line lattices, built by combining this \u03a3_k^i-action with a suitable gauging of the one-form symmetry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we have exploited  the recipe of <cit.> for arranging the charge lattice of\ngenuine lines modulo screening by dynamical particles.\nWe have adapted such strategy, originally designed for BPS quivers, to the case of (p,q)-strings, in order to access to the\nelectromagnetic charges of non-Lagrangian \ud835\udca9=3 S-fold SCFTs.\nThis procedure has allowed us to provide a full classification of the one-form symmetries of every S-fold SCFT. \nWe singled out two cases  with a non-trivial one-form symmetry, corresponding to  the \u2124_3 and the \u2124_4 S-folds in absence of discrete torsion, denoted here as S_3,1 and S_4,1 respectively.\nOur results are consistent with the supersymmetry enhancement that takes place when two D3-branes are considered.\nLastly, we discuss the possibility of non-invertible duality defects, by recovering the expected results for the cases with \nsupersymmetry enhancement and proposing a generalization at any rank.\n\n\nWe left many open questions that deserve further investigations.\nIt would for example be interesting to study in more details the projection of the states generated by the (p,q)-configurations in an S-fold \nbackground. In the present article, the only relevant information was the electromagnetic charges carried by these states, but a deeper analysis of the dynamics of these S-fold theories requires more work. This would in turn improve our understanding of their mass spectrum. For instance, a comparison of the BPS spectrum could be made exploiting the Lagrangian descriptions of <cit.>.\nThis could also help finding the origin of the mapping between the multiple lattices found in the S_3,1 and S_4,1-cases. \nFurther investigations in this direction would deepen our geometric understanding of the non-invertible symmetries expected in this class of theories, along the lines of the brane analysis of <cit.>.\n\nIt would also be of interest to generalize the analysis to other \ud835\udca9=3 SCFTs that are not constructed from S-fold projections, such as the exceptional \ud835\udca9 = 3 theories <cit.>. These theories can be obtained from M-theory backgrounds and one may study the charge lattice with probe M2-branes. One could therefore apply an analysis similar to the one spelled in <cit.>.\n\nRegarding the S-fold constructions, the cases of S-folds with \ud835\udca9=2 supersymmetry <cit.> also deserve further investigations (see <cit.> for similar analysis in class S theories). In the absence of BPS quivers, one needs to adapt the UV analysis of <cit.>. In general, one would like to find a stringy description that avoids wall crossing and allows reading the charge lattices and the one-form symmetries for such theories.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n\nWe are grateful to I\u00f1aki Garc\u00eda Etxebarria for valuable insights on the manuscript, and to Shani Meynet and Robert Moscrop for useful discussions.\nThe work of A.A., D.M., A.P. and S.R. has been supported in part by the Italian Ministero dell\u2019Istruzione, Universit\u00e0 e Ricerca (MIUR), in part by Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) through the \u201cGauge Theories, Strings, Supergravity\u201d (GSS) research project and in part by MIUR-PRIN contract 2017CC72MK-003. \nV.T. acknowledges funding by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany\u2019s Excellence Strategy EXC 2181/1 - 390900948 (the Heidelberg STRUCTURES Excellence Cluster).\n\n\n\nJHEP\n\n\n"}
