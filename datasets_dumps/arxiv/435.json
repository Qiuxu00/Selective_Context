In the last few decades, the achievement in designing quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators\u00a0<cit.>, quantum diodes\u00a0<cit.>, quantum thermal transistors\u00a0<cit.>, quantum batteries\u00a0<cit.> has built the backbone of quantum technologies, which aims to enhance the efficiencies of quantum devices over their classical counterparts\u00a0<cit.>. The confluence of quantum thermodynamics with many-body physics\u00a0<cit.>, quantum information theory\u00a0<cit.>, statistical and solid-state physics\u00a0<cit.> have triggered the implementations of quantum devices in experiments using superconducting qubits\u00a0<cit.>, mesoscopic substrates\u00a0<cit.>, ionic systems\u00a0<cit.>, nuclear magnetic resonance\u00a0<cit.>, etc. The performance of such devices is evidently controlled by thermal baths or  environments connected to the machinery setup, and the dynamics of the device components are driven by the open quantum evolutions\u00a0<cit.>. The thermal baths, that influence the efficiency of performance of the devices, can either be Markovian or non-Markovian depending on the validity of Born-Markov approximations\u00a0<cit.>. In general, the efficiencies of quantum thermal devices immersed in Markovian\u00a0<cit.> environments are computable and the dynamics of the machinery components \ncan be efficiently handled.\n\n\nMost of the thermal baths, however, reside in a non-Markovian family and therefore makes the realistic situations different from the ideal Markovian dynamics. There exists a significant body of work on quantum thermal machines operating under more than one thermal baths, which are either all Markovian\u00a0<cit.> or all non-Markovian\u00a0<cit.>.  \n\n\n\n\nThe miniaturisation of technologies has acquired a considerable momentum with the introduction of the concept of quantum absorption refrigerators by Linden et al. in\u00a0<cit.>. \n\n\nThe devices consist of a small number of qubits\u00a0<cit.> and/or qudits\u00a0<cit.> which are driven by local Markovian baths attached to the respective subsystems and a local cooling of one of the qubits, named as the cold qubit, can be attained. \nThe absorption refrigerators are self-contained refrigerators, that usually operate in the absorption region, where no external energy is required for the cooling process\u00a0<cit.>. The dynamics of the device components is regulated to transfer thermal energy from a cold to a hot bath with the aid of a third heat bath, known as the work reservoir, both in the steady and in the transient regimes, in order to decrease the cold qubit's temperature with respect to its initial temperature. To put it in another way, maintaining the state of the cold qubit in the currently accessible ground state allows the cooling of the qubit which is achieved by lowering the system's local temperature. \n\n\nAlong with theoretical advancements, the implementation of quantum absorption refrigerators in quantum few-level systems have been devised by employing quantum dots\u00a0<cit.>, atom-cavity systems\u00a0<cit.> and circuit QED architectures\u00a0<cit.>. Recently, three trapped ions\u00a0<cit.> have also been used to construct a quantum absorption refrigerator. These refrigerators are anticipated to be helpful in instances where in-situ, on-demand cooling of systems as small as a qubit may be necessary without the need of external energy transfer and faster than the qubit's equilibriation time with a heat bath.\n\nThe aforementioned works on quantum absorption refrigerators are mostly investigated in Markovian environments. Naturally, the efficiency of performance of the devices may be altered when connected with non-Markovian baths. In practical situations, most of the environments exhibit non-Markovian behaviour. In order to belong to the Markovian family, the thermal baths must be infinitely large and have a continuous energy spectrum\u00a0<cit.>. The bosonic bath, consisting of an infinite number of harmonic oscillators, within certain constraints, behaves as a Markovian one. Most of the common baths, such as spin-baths\u00a0<cit.>, are not Markovian. A few non-Markovian baths have Markovian limits, while for others, such as the spin star model, such a limit is evasive\u00a0<cit.>. As Markovian nature of a thermal bath is, in general, far from the realistic scenario, it is important to study the effect of non-Markovianity on the refrigeration process. Sometimes, the situation may be more complex, in that while some of the thermal environments connected locally to the device components are Markovian, and the rest are not so. For such mixed local environments, the sub-systems of the machinery setup evolve under a combination of local Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics\u00a0<cit.>. Such situations can arise, e.g. while considering hybrid systems like atom-photon arrangements.\n\n\n\n\nTo discuss the non-Markovian effects on refrigeration, it is necessary to detect and quantify non-Markovianity of the system dynamics. There are a variety of non-Markovianity measures\u00a0<cit.>, that are not all analogous. Two widely used measures were proposed by Breuer-Laine-Pillo (BLP)\u00a0<cit.> and Rivas-Huelga-Plenio (RHP)\u00a0<cit.>, that use non-monotonicity in time-evolution of state distinguishability and system-auxiliary entanglement respectively. \n\nFor more works on non-Markovianity measures, see e.g.\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we consider a few-qubit refrigerator where each qubit is connected with a local reservoir, and look at the effect of substituting each Markovian reservoir by a non-Markovian one. The Markovian baths are considered to be bosonic in nature, interacting with the appropriate qubits via Markovian qubit-bath interactions. When the Markovian baths are replaced by non-Markovian spin-baths, the model is found to be advantageous over the complete Markovian scenario, which we call the \u201cideal\" case.\nAlong with three-qubit refrigerator models, with one or more non-Markovian reservoirs, producing advantages over the Markovian baths setting, \nwe also, for comparison and completeness, consider\n\nsingle- and two-qubit self-sustained thermal devices kept in contact with one or more spin-baths, which in certain situations also exhibit refrigeration.\nSubsequently, we propose a measure of non-Markovianity in these devices.\n\nFinally, since noise permeates all practical implementations of quantum machines, the three-qubit refrigerator is analysed in presence of several Markovian noise models. \n\nThe remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. The relevant information necessary to formulate the problem is discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. This includes establishing the system Hamiltonian, the initial state, and providing a formal definition of local temperature of the individual qubits.\nIn Section\u00a0<ref>, we analyse \n\nthe interaction of the system with the Markovian and non-Markovian baths with a detailed description of the system operators. \n\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>, there is given a quantifier of non-Markovianity and its comparison with the well-known RHP measure. Sec.\u00a0<ref> illustrates the operation of the refrigerator in presence of noise. Finally, the concluding remarks are presented in Sec.\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 QUANTUM ABSORPTION REFRIGERATOR\n\n\nA quantum absorption refrigerator usually comprises of three interacting qubits locally connected with three Markovian thermal baths B_1^M, B_2^M and B_3^M respectively, where the superscripts M stands for Markovian environments. The first qubit is the one to be cooled, often termed as the cold qubit, while the second and third qubits perform the refrigeration\u00a0<cit.>. \n\nThe Hamiltonian of the three-qubit system is represented as H_S=H_loc+H_int, where H_loc represents the local Hamiltonian of the three individual qubits and H_int describes the  interaction between the qubits. The H_loc and H_int are respectively considered to be\n\n    H_loc=K/2\u2211_i=1^3 E_i \u03c3_i^z,\n          H_int=Kg(|010\u27e9\u27e8101|+|101\u27e9\u27e8010|).\n\nHere |1\u27e9_i and |0\u27e9_i are the ground and excited states \n\nof the i^th qubit, having energies -K E_i/2 and K E_i/2 respectively, where K is an arbitrary constant having the unit of energy.\n\n\n \n\n{E_i} are dimensionless quantities and g is the dimensionless interaction strength. \u03c3_i^z stands for the z-component of the Pauli matrices, \u03c3\u20d7_\u20d7i\u20d7(\u03c3_i^x,\u03c3_i^y,\u03c3_i^z), for i^th qubit.\nThe individual qubits are connected with local heat baths of temperatures \u03c4_1, \u03c4_2 and \u03c4_3 respectively, where \u03c4_1 \u2264\u03c4_2 \u2264\u03c4_3. \n\u03c4_2 is initially chosen to be at room temperature. Note that,  \u03c4_1, \u03c4_2 and \u03c4_3 are dimensionless temperatures with the actual temperatures  \u03c4\u0303_1, \u03c4\u0303_2 and \u03c4\u0303_3, defined as \u03c4_1=k_B\u03c4\u0303_1/K, \u03c4_2=k_B\u03c4\u0303_2/K and \u03c4_3=k_B\u03c4\u0303_3/K respectively, where k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo construct a self-contained refrigerator, which can operate autonomously independent of any external source, \n\na special choice of the energy of the qubits, E_1+E_3=E_2, has to be taken\u00a0<cit.>.\nAdditionally, we also set the first qubit to remain at room temperature initially, i.e.,  \u03c4_1=\u03c4_2.\n\nAt t=0, where t being the dimensionless time with the actual time t\u0303 representing as t=K t\u0303/\u0127, we start with the situation where the three qubits are separately in thermal equilibrium with the three reservoirs locally connected to them.\n\nSo, the initial state of the three-qubit system is \n\ngiven by\n\n    \u03c1_0=\u03c1_0^1 \u2297\u03c1_0^2 \u2297\u03c1_0^3.\n\nHere \u03c1_0^i=Z_i^-1exp(-\u03b2_i E_i \u03c3_i^z/2), where Z_i is the partition function for the i^th qubit represented by Z_i=Tr[exp(-\u03b2_i E_i \u03c3_i^z/2)] and \u03b2_i is the corresponding dimensionless inverse temperature given by \u03b2_i=1/\u03c4_i.\n\nAfter turning on the interaction between the qubits for t>0, the system undergoes a time evolution governed by the quantum master equation of the Lindblad  form\u00a0<cit.>\n\n    \u2202\u03c1_s(t)/\u2202 t =\u2112(\u03c1_s(t))= -i/K[H_S,\u03c1_s(t)] +\u2211_i=1^3 \u0127/K\ud835\udc9f_i(\u03c1_s(t)),\n\nwhere \u03c1_s(t) is the reduced state of the three-qubit system at time t and \ud835\udc9f_i(\u03c1_s(t)) comes from the decoherence effects of the i^th bath. The form of \ud835\udc9f_i(\u03c1_s(t)) solely depends on the type of the i^th bath connected to the systems and it may have different forms for Markovian and non-Markovian environments. \nOne point is to be borne in mind that, initially, the density matrices of the three reduced subsystems are diagonal \n\nin the eigenbasis of H_loc. As the Markovian baths do not generate coherence, the  \nlocal subsystems \u03c1_i(t)=Tr_j,k(\u03c1_s(t)), j,k  i [i,j,k \u2208{1,2,3}],  also remain diagonal at a later time t. This helps us to define a local temperature for the qubits. Let the reduced state of the first qubit after time development be \n\n\n\n    \u03c1_1(t)=r_1(t) |0\u27e9\u27e80| +[1-r_1(t)]|1\u27e9\u27e81|,\n\nwhere r_1(t) is the population in the ground state at time t, given by r_1=Z_1^-1exp (-E_1/2 T_1(t)). T_1(t) being the dimensionless local temperature of the cold qubit at time t, with the actual temperature T\u0303_1(t) represented as\n\n    T_1(t)=k_B T\u0303_1(t)/K=E_1[ ln( 1-r_1(t)/r_1(t)) ]^-1.\n\nThe temperatures of the remaining two qubits can also be defined in a similar fashion. The definition of local temperatures for any qubit is based on the population of ground and excited states of the system. Decrease in temperature is here manifested as an increase in the ground state population. In all further discussions, temperatures and time indicate the corresponding dimensionless temperature and time defined above.\n\n\n\nFor proper refrigeration to occur, the local temperature of the cold qubit is to be sufficiently reduced than its initial temperature, i.e., T_1(t)<\u03c4_1, during the evolution of the system in presence of the heat baths, until it attains a steady or canonical equilibrium state. If the temperature of the cold qubit in the steady state, T_1^S, is lower than \u03c4_1, we say that a steady state cooling (SSC) has been achieved. Also, in the transient regime, cooling is attained at time scales shorter than the steady state, and a temperature much less than \u03c4_1 may be achieved. Such a cooling may be referred to as transient cooling (TC)\u00a0<cit.>. \n\n\nSometimes TC can be obtained without the occurrence of SSC.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Refrigeration in Markovian environment\n\n\n\nA local cooling of qubit-1 can be obtained by the three-qubit three-bath setup with the bath configuration {B_1^M,B_2^M,B_3^M}, which means all the three baths are Markovian. \n\nWe consider the Markovian baths to be bosonic baths consisting of infinite number of harmonic oscillators with a frequency range varying widely. The Hamiltonian of the baths is taken to be H_B^M=\u2211_i=1^3 H_B_i^M, where\n\n    H_B_i^M=\n        \n        \u222b_0^\u03a9\u0127\u03c9\u0303\u03b7_\u03c9^i\u2020\u03b7_\u03c9^id\u03c9.\n\nHere \u03c9\u0303 is an arbitrary constant having the unit of frequency and \u03a9 is the cutoff frequency taken to be same for all the baths, which is very high such that the memory time,  \u03a9^-1, is negligibly small and we can safely incorporate the Markovian approximations\u00a0<cit.>. \u03b7^i\u2020_\u03c9(\u03b7^i_\u03c9), having the unit of 1/\u221a(\u03c9), represents the bosonic creation (anihilation) operators corresponding to the mode \u03c9 of i^th bath. The system-bath interaction Hamiltonian is taken as H_SB^M=\u2211_i H_SB_i^M, where\n\n\n    H_SB_i^M=\u222b_0^\u03a9\u0127\u221a(\u03c9\u0303)d\u03c9 h_i(\u03c9)\u03c3_i^x\u2297 (\u03b7_\u03c9^i\u2020+\u03b7^i_\u03c9)\n\ndescribes the interaction between the i^th system and i^th bath. Here h_i(\u03c9) is a dimensionless function of \u03c9, which tunes the coupling of qubit-i and B_i^M. For harmonic oscillator baths, \u03c9\u0303 h_i^2(\u03c9)=J_i(\u03c9), where J_i(\u03c9) is the spectral density function of B_i^M. In this paper, we have taken J_i(\u03c9) to be Ohmic spectral density function in the form J_i(\u03c9)= \u03b1_i \u03c9exp(-\u03c9/\u03a9). \u03b1_i stands for the dimensionless qubit-bath interaction strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dynamical equation of the system is given by the Gorini\u2013Kossakowski\u2013Sudarshan\u2013Lindblad (GKSL) master equation\n\npresented by Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) with the dissipative parts,\n\n\n    \ud835\udc9f_i(\u03c1_s(t)) = \u2211_\u03c9^'\u03b3_i(\u03c9^') [L_i^\u03c9^'\u03c1_s(t) L^\u03c9^'\u2020_i -1/2{ L_i^\u03c9^'\u2020 L^\u03c9^'_i, \u03c1_s(t) }].\n\nHere i=1,2,3. \u03b3_i(\u03c9^') is the decay rate having the unit of time^-1 and { L^\u03c9^'_i } refers to the Lindblad operators corresponding to the possible transition energies \u03c9^' of the system. \n\nFor the validation of Born-Markov approximations, we are residing in the weak coupling limit, max{\u03b3\u0303_i(\u03c9^')}\u226amin{E_i,g}, where \u03b3\u0303_i(\u03c9^')=\u0127\u03b3_i(\u03c9^')/K. \nThe explicit expressions of the Lindblad operators and the decay constants {\u03b3_i(\u03c9^')} are given in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\nIt is already known that there are three operating regimes of an ideal quantum absorption refrigerator with the configuration {B_1^M,B_2^M,B_3^M}, depending on the qubit-bath interaction strengths, \u03b1_i for i=1,2,3, of the three-qubit three-bath model\u00a0<cit.>. An example of these three scenarios is described below in a regime, where the coupling between the qubits are taken to be strong, i.e., g \u2248 E_i.\n\n\n\n\n\ud835\udc12_1: TC without SSC. Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a) shows a refrigeration of the cold qubit in the regime where transient cooling occurs without the occurance of steady state cooling. \n\nThe minimum of the transient temperature is acquired for T_1^C \u2248 0.84. After a finite time, the temperature of the cold bath saturates at a value higher than the initial temperature \u03c4_1=1, displaying a characteristic of steady state heating. \n\n\n\n\ud835\udc12_2: TC better than SSC. From Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(b) we can realise a situation where both the transient and steady state cooling occur, but the transient cooling is better than the steady state one. Comparing with Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a), it is noted that in the transient region, the behaviour of the system remains qualitatively same attaining a minimum temperature at T_1^' C\u2248 0.84. Also, there is an additional feature of steady state cooling (T_1^' S\u2248 0.88) which is completely non-existent in the previous case (\ud835\udc12_1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud835\udc12_3: SSC better than TC. Fig\u00a0<ref>-(c) describes a operative region of the refrigerator where both the transient and steady state cooling occur, but the steady state cooling is better than the transient one.\n\nIn all the three situations \ud835\udc12_1, \ud835\udc12_2 and \ud835\udc12_3, we get a specific parameter region of {\u03b1_1,\u03b1_2,\u03b1_3} for the operation of the refrigerators. For the convenience of notation we will denote the specific regions as {\u03b1_1^S_i,\u03b1_2^S_i,\u03b1_3^S_i} for the corresponding situation \ud835\udc12_\ud835\udc22 with i=1,2 and 3. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 EFFECT OF NON-MARKOVIANITY ON THE REFRIGERATION\n\n\n\n\nA Markovian situation is a very special case having some strict restrictions on the thermal baths, whereas the existence of a non-Markovian bath in the nature is more likely. So, there may occur some erroneous tuning of the parameters of the thermal baths, and any of the three bath or all the three baths may show non-Markovianity. Hence, the effect of non-Markovian baths on the refrigeration is needed to be studied. Let us first discuss the case, where all the three baths in the three-qubit three-bath refrigerator setup are non-Markovian i.e., the configuration is {B_1^NM,B_2^NM,B_3^NM}. The NM in the superscripts stands for the non-Markovian baths. In this case, the system bath interaction is considered to form a \u201cspin-star\" configuration. There are N+1 number of spins, among which N are lying on the surface of a sphere with one single central spin at equal distance from the spins on the surface. The central spin comprises the open system and is supposed to belong to a two dimensional Hilbert space \u210b_A, while the surrounding spins constitute the environment associated with a Hilbert space \u210b_B whose dimension is an N-fold tensor product of two dimensional spaces. The local Hamiltonian of the i^th bath is taken as\n\n    H_B_i^NM=\u0127\u03bd_i J_i^+J_i^-,\n\nwhere\n\n    J_i^\u00b1=\u2211_i^N\u03c3_(i)^\u00b1  and  \u03c3_i^\u00b1=\u03c3_x^i \u00b1 i\u03c3_y^i/2,\n\nwith \u03bd_i being the frequency of B_i^NM.\nThe interaction between the central spin and neighbouring spins is taken to be of the form of the Heisenberg XY interaction\u00a0<cit.>, given by\n\n    H_SB_i^NM=2 K\u03b1_0 ( \u03c3_i^+ J_i^- + \u03c3_i^- J_i^+ ).\n\n\nHere, \u03b1_0 stands for the dimensionless interaction strength. For our entire analysis, we have chosen \u03b1_0=0.5. The time dynamics of the reduced three-qubit system after tracing out the baths is controlled by the following equation,\n\n    \u03c1_s(t) = Tr_B [e^-i(H_S+H_I)\u03c1(t) e^i(H_S+H_I)],\n\nwhere \u03c1(t) is the combined state of system-bath setup at time t.\n\n\n\nThe effect of cooling of the first qubit, for the configuration {B_1^NM,B_2^NM,B_3^NM} is depicted in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. The temperature T_1(t) oscillates between 0.8 and 0.96. So, the minimum transient temperature attained by qubit-1 is less than the minimum transient (\u2248 0.84) and steady state temperatures (> 0.86) for the settings in  Figs.<ref>-(a) and (b), but is not better than the situation  depicted in Fig.<ref>-(c), attained for the ideal Markovian cases. Therefore, the transient cooling of the first qubit can be enhanced for certain choices of the bath parameters, once all the three baths attached to the system are made non-Markovian. An important point is to be noted that, although the rapidity of oscillation of T_1(t) reduces with the increase of time, but the steady state is not reached due to the non-Markovian nature of the system-bath interaction, or it may appear at a larger timescale. So, a steady state cooling may not be attainable for the situation where all the three baths are non-Markovian. \n\nSince some baths (with some restrictions) can be considered as a member of a Markovian family and some non-Markovian baths have their Markovian limits, so it is justifiable to have a situation where among the three baths one or two will be Markovian and the remaining are not so. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe time evolution of the three-qubit system as a whole in presence of such a mixture of local Markovian and non-Markovian environments is given by the following equation\u00a0<cit.>\n\n    \u2202\u03c1\u0303_s(t)/\u2202 t =\u2112(\u03c1\u0303_s(t))= -i/K[H_S,\u03c1\u0303_s(t)]\n          + \u0127/K\u2211_{i_m}\ud835\udc9f_M_i_m(\u03c1\u0303_s(t))+ \u0127/K\u2211_{i_n}\ud835\udc9f_NM_i_n(\u03c1_sB_{i_n}^NM(t)).\n\nHere, each of i_m and i_n stands for the i^th qubit, connected to i^th bath which can be either m^th Markovian or n^th non-Markovian, with m and n are the total number of Markovian and non-Markovian baths respectively.  \n\n\nThe reduced state of the system \u03c1\u0303_s(t) is given by \u03c1\u0303_s(t)=Tr_B_{i_n}(\u03c1_sB_{i_n}^NM(t)), where \u03c1_sB_{i_n}^NM(t) is the system state correlated with all the non-Markovian baths.  \ud835\udc9f_M_i_m(\u03c1\u0303_s(t)) is the dissipative term coming from the interaction between i^th qubit and i^th bath, which is a Markovian bosonic one, having the form same as Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). The Lindblad operators of this dissipative term corresponding to i_m=i can be presented as L_i^\u03c9^' for i=1, 2 and 3 and has the same structure as in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). \ud835\udc9f_NM_i_n(\u03c1_sB_{i_n}^NM(t)) is the same coming from the i^th qubit-bath interaction, for which the bath is non-Markovian, given by\n\n    \ud835\udc9f_NM_i_n(\u03c1_sB_{i_n}^NM(t)) = -i/\u0127Tr_B_i_n^NM[ H_SB_i_n^NM,\u03c1_sB_{i_n}^NM(t) ].\n\nThe choice of spin star model as a non-Markovian bath ensures that\n\nthe reduced subsystem of \nthe first qubit is diagonal in the eigenbasis of the system Hamiltonian, hence curtailing any ambiguity regarding the definition of local temperature for the combination of local Markovian and non-Markovian evolution. We now replace the Markovian baths of the ideal absorption refrigerator by non-Markovian reservoirs successively and investigate the effect of a mixed set of local environments on the transient as well as the steady state cooling of the first qubit. We refer to the usual three-qubit three Markovian baths setup to be an \u201cideal\" one and after replacing any of the Markovian bath with a non-Markovian one, we denote the situations as \u201caltered\" scenarios. In all the three altered setups, \ud835\udc12_1, \ud835\udc12_2 and \ud835\udc12_3, the parameters of the Markovian baths, \u03b1_i for i=1,2 and 3, are same as in ideal \ud835\udc12_1, \ud835\udc12_2 and \ud835\udc12_3 scenarios respectively, and all the parameters of the non-Markovian baths are same as in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. In this paper, we have considered four altered scenarios by taking two situations with m=2 and n=1 in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) with the bath configurations: \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i\u2261{B_1^NM,B_2^M,B_3^M} and \ud835\udc9c_2^S_i\u2261{B_1^M,B_2^M,B_3^NM}, and two situations with m=1 and n=2 with the bath configurations: \ud835\udc9c_3^S_i\u2261{B_1^NM,B_2^M,B_3^NM} and \ud835\udc9c_4^S_i\u2261{B_1^M,B_2^NM,B_3^NM}. The superscripts, S_i, denote the corresponding ideal situations \ud835\udc12_1, \ud835\udc12_2 and \ud835\udc12_3 respectively for i=1,2 and 3. Therefore the parameter spaces corresponding to these four scenarios \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i, \ud835\udc9c_2^S_i, \ud835\udc9c_3^S_i and \ud835\udc9c_4^S_i are respectively {\u03b1_0,\u03b1_2^S_i,\u03b1_3^S_i}, {\u03b1_1^S_i,\u03b1_2^S_i,\u03b1_0}, {\u03b1_0,\u03b1_2^S_i,\u03b1_0} and {\u03b1_1^S_i,\u03b1_0,\u03b1_0}. The situations \ud835\udc9c_1^S_1, \ud835\udc9c_3^S_1 and \ud835\udc9c_4^S_2 are same as \ud835\udc9c_1^S_2, \ud835\udc9c_3^S_2 and \ud835\udc9c_4^S_3 respectively, since \u03b1_1^S_2=\u03b1_1^S_3, \u03b1_2^S_3=\u03b1_2^S_2 and \u03b1_3^S_1=\u03b1_3^S_2.\nFurther, we compare the three-qubit refrigerator model with one and two-qubit self-sustaining thermal devices kept in contact with spin-baths, which also exhibit refrigeration in certain situations.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Cooling of the cold qubit in the altered situation of \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Let us first consider a situation where there is a single qubit attached to a spin-environment where the qubit-bath interaction is given by Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). The system Hamiltonian is considered to be H^1=E_1^1\u03c3_z/2. The initial state is taken as a product of the thermal states of the qubit and bath, each of which are at temperature T_1^1=1. After the evolution, the final state is also diagonal, and we can calculate the temperature corresponding to the final state. If we consider the environment to consist of only a single spin, i.e. N=1 in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), then the expression of the final temperature of the qubit, hence obtained, is given in Appendix\u00a0<ref>. \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that if E_1^1 < 1, then the temperature, T_1(t), oscillates uniformly between T_1(t)=1 and some T_1(t) < 1, but the envelope of temperature oscillations is linear and never converges to equilibrium. So there is an instance of transient refrigeration at certain times, although the maximum of the envelope never goes below unity(Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a)).\n\nNext let us consider a two-qubit thermal device comprising of the cold qubit and one of the other two qubits of the three-qubit absorption refrigerator. So the configuration is either \ud835\udcac_1={B_1^NM,B_2^M} or \ud835\udcac_2={B_1^NM,B_3^M}.  The interactions between the two qubits for the configurations \ud835\udcac_1 and \ud835\udcac_2 are H_1=|01\u27e9\u27e810|+|10\u27e9\u27e801| and H_2=|00\u27e9\u27e811|+|11\u27e9\u27e800| respectively.\nLet us first look at the case \ud835\udcac_1. The local Hamiltonian is H^2=(E_1^2/2) \u03c3_z^(1)+(E_2^2/2) \u03c3_z^(2). The two eigenstates of H^2, |01\u27e9 and |10\u27e9, are degenerate if E_1^2=E_2^2, and therefore the swapping, |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9, can be done without any input of external energy. \nHowever under this condition, the initial temperature of the first qubit being T_1 and the second qubit being T_2, satisfying \u03c4_1=T_1 \u2264 T_2, one always obtains the final temperature T_1(t) > \u03c4_1, and there is no refrigeration.\nOn the other hand, for the configuration, \ud835\udcac_2, the self-sustained condition is given by E_1^2=-E_2^2, where no external energy input is needed.\nUnder this condition, keeping T_1 \u2264 T_2, and E^2_1 < 1, there is an instance of refrigeration, and we depict the particular case of E^2_1 = 0.5 in Fig.<ref>-(b).\nSo refrigeration is observed under certain conditions in the single and two-qubit scenarios, when the first qubit is attached to spin-bath, but in none of these situations steady state cooling is achieved.\n\nLet us now move to the three-qubit case. We consider a three-qubit ideal quantum absorption refrigerator operating in the parameter regime \ud835\udc12_1. \nWe now replace the Markovian bath attached to the cold qubit by a non-Markovian one, which gives the configuration \ud835\udc9c_1^S_1, i.e., {B_1^NM,B_2^M,B_3^M}. The system-bath interaction is now governed by H\u0303_1=H_SB_1^NM+\u2211_i=2^3 H_SB_i^M. \n\n\nIn Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a) we depict the dynamics of the temperature of the first qubit in this scenario. We observe that the refrigeration of the refrigerator is present here. The transient temperature T_1(t) approaches a minimum > 0.75, which is less than the same of the corresponding ideal Markovian baths case T_1^C, and in course of time slowly attains a steady state temperature with temperature \u2248 0.7. So, in this altered situation we acquire both transient cooling (TC) and steady state cooling (SSC), while for the ideal Markovian case, the SSC was non-existent in \ud835\udc12_1 (see Fig\u00a0<ref>-(a)).\nIf we consider the parameter regime, \ud835\udc12_2, and substitute the first Markovian bath by a non-Markovian one, we get the configuration \ud835\udc9c_1^S_2. This configuration is qualitatively the same as in \ud835\udc9c_1^S_1, since \u03b1_2 and \u03b1_3 are equal in both these cases.\n\nWe now look at the effect of combined local Markovian and non-Markovian evolution on the operation of an ideal absorption refrigerator with the bath combination {B_1^NM,B_2^M,B_3^M}, but in the parameter space \ud835\udc12_3. \n\nIn this case, \nthe minimum of the transient temperature T^C_1_min<T_1^' C of the ideal case, and it approaches the steady state with temperature T_1^S<T'_1^S. So, here also, the refrigeration of the refrigerator is prevalent, and both TC and SSC is observed.\n\n\nIn the case of \ud835\udc9c_1^S_3, we can attain a steady state cooling with a temperature of the first qubit  \u2248 0.7, while in the ideal case of S_3, the steady state temperature is \u2248 0.75. Hence, compared to Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(c), an enhancement occurs both in the transient cooling and the steady state cooling when compared with the ideal scenario \ud835\udc12_3. Therefore, we can infer that, a reduction of the temperature of cold qubit is clearly visible in the transient and steady state regime for this altered setup, \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the replacement of the Markovian bath attached to the cold qubit of an ideal absorption refrigerator in the operating regime \ud835\udc12_1 (or \ud835\udc12_2),  enhance the transient cooling by reducing the temperature of the cold qubit below the cooling obtained in the ideal Markovian case (< T_1^C). Moreover, the system equilibriates towards a steady state temperature in this altered situation of \ud835\udc12_1 (or \ud835\udc12_2).\n\n\nSimilarly, substituting the first Markovian reservoir by a non-Markovian one for the setting  \ud835\udc12_3, one attains an improved refrigeration both in the transient state and steady state regimes.\nSo, the results in this subsection depict that if we substitute the Markovian bath attached to the cold qubit by a spin-environment, both transient and steady state cooling can be achieved, which is better than the ideal Markovian case.\nFurther, we compare the situation \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i with the single-qubit case. For the single-qubit, we find that refrigeration is non-existent unless E_1^1<1, while in the three-qubit scenario, we always consider E_1=E_3=1.  \nAlso, unlike the case of \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i, the final temperature in the single-qubit situation does not attain a staedy state, although it periodically goes below its initial temperature, T_1^1 = 1  (compare Figs.\u00a0<ref>-(a) and \u00a0<ref>).\nNow if we ompare \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i with the setting \ud835\udcac_2, we see that\nrefrigeration is present in both the settings, but again in the two-qubit case, E_1^2 has to be less than unity.\nAlso, unlike \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i,  the oscillations in \ud835\udcac_2 are persistent and steady state is not attained (compare Figs.\u00a0<ref>-(b) and \u00a0<ref>).\nThus attainment of steady state cooling is a distinct feature of the quantum absorption refrigerator consisting of three qubits and not less than that.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Cooling of the cold qubit in the altered situation of \ud835\udc9c_2^S_i\n\n\n\nWe begin this subsection by considering the ideal three-qubit scenario where all the three baths are Markovian, and substitute the bath, which is not connected to the cold qubit, by a non-Markovian one.\nWe consider the three parameter regimes of \ud835\udc12_1, \ud835\udc12_2 and \ud835\udc12_3, and look at the effect of  replacing the bosonic bath attached to the third qubit of the \u201cideal\" scenario into a non-Markovian one, i.e. {B_1^M,B_2^M,B_3^NM}.  The situation is qualitatively same for {B_1^M,B_2^NM,B_3^M} configuration also (not shown).\nIf we substitute any one of the second or third bosonic baths with a non-Markovian one, say the third one, i.e., the configuration \ud835\udc9c_2^S_1 ({B_1^M,B_2^M,B_3^NM}), we  obtain only TC but do not obtain SSC as evident from Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a). In this situation, the minimum transient temperature is < 0.88, which at steady state regime converges to a value > 1.\n\nSimilarly for the configuration  \ud835\udc12_2, if the third qubit is connected to the non-Markovian spin-bath while the others being Markovian, i.e., \ud835\udc9c_2^S_2,  transient cooling is evident but steady state cooling may not be obtained, and the refrigeration of the refrigerator is present in the transient region only. See Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(b). Here the minimum transient temperature, < 0.88, and the steady state temperature, \u2248 0.98,  are greater than the corresponding minimum transient temperature and the equilibrium temperature of the final state in the corresponding ideal Markovian case. This feature is different from the \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i scenario, where there was an advantage over the corresponding ideal Markovian scenarios.\n\nSimilarly, the configuration \ud835\udc9c_2^S_3 exhibits transient cooling of the first qubit as depicted in Fig.(<ref>-(c)). The minimum transient temperature lies beneath \u2248 0.88 and equilibriates to  a value \u2248 0.98.\nSo in the setting, \ud835\udc9c_2^S_i, the action of the refrigerator in the transient regime still persists but without any advantage over the \u201cideal\" Markovian case, and also showing instances of steady state heating.\n\nHence, only TC is obtained but with no advanatge over the \u201cideal\" Markovian scenario with the Markovian and non-Markovian bath ratio 2:1, if the first qubit is not kept in contact with the non-Markovian environment. Moreover, though the oscillations vary within a certain range of temperature in the transient region, the temperatures for all these three cases tend to attain an equilibrium at some large timescales. So attainability of steady state is also a feature noted in this situation.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Cooling of the cold qubit in the altered situation of \ud835\udc9c_3^S_i\n\n\nHere we consider an ideal three-qubit quantum refrigerator where all the three qubits are initially attached to Markovian baths, and  two of them, say first and third one, are replaced by a spin-environment.\nSo, here we consider the setting \ud835\udc9c_3^S_i, i.e., {B_1^NM,B_2^M,B_3^NM}, where the system-bath interaction is governed by H\u0303_1=\u2211_i=2^3 H_SB_1^NM+ H_SB_i^M.\nThe features obtained in this setting are qualitatively same for the configuration, {B_1^NM,B_2^NM,B_3^M} (not shown).\nLet us first look at the configuration \ud835\udc9c_3^S_1, as depicted in\u00a0<ref>-(a). \n\nThe transient temperature T_1(t) oscillates rapidly between 0.75 and 1.0 with its magnitude never surpassing unity. The minima of T_1(t) varies around \u2248 0.75, which shows refrigeration along with an enhancement in cooling of the first qubit than the minimum transient temperature of the corresponding ideal Markovian case. Compare Figs.\u00a0<ref>-(a) and\u00a0<ref>-(a).\n The setting \ud835\udc9c_3^S_2 is qualitatively same as the previous case, \ud835\udc9c_3^S_1 because of the choice of \u03b1_2. Moreover,the attainment of equilibrium is non-existent in this scenario in a sufficiently large time-scale.\n\nNext we consider the parameters corresponding to the configuration, \ud835\udc9c_3^S_3, where we observe similar features. The transient temperature, T_1(t), varies between \u2248 0.75 and 1.0, and the envelope of oscillations narrows down within the observed time. It may or may not reach equilibrium at large times. The refrigeration, however, is existent and the minimum transient temperature in this case(\u2248 0.75) is less than the minimum transient temperature in the corresponding ideal Markovian case\u00a0<ref>-(c), although not less than its steady state temperature.\n\n\n\nTherefore, substituting any two Markovian baths including the first one is beneficial as this enhance the transient cooling, but the increase of non-Markovianity restrict the attainability of the steady state cooling.\n\n\nOne distinct nature of this m=1, n=2 cases is that, the oscillations in T_1(t) consistently persist with undiminished amplitudes and do not tend to saturate in a sufficiently large time-scale. This behaviour appears with the increase in the number of non-Markovian baths and qualitatively resembles the situation where all the three baths are non-Markovian. Compare with Fig.\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\nNext we compare the results obtained using the configuration, \ud835\udc9c_3^S_i, with the single-qubit case. \nIn the single-qubit scenario, refrigeration effect is present with periodic oscillations under the condition E_1^1 < 1 and not with E_1^1=1. But in the three-qubit situation, we always consider E_1=E_3=1. \nMoreover, in the single-qubit case, the envelope of oscilllations does not vary with time, a feature similar to \ud835\udc9c_3^S_1 (refer to figures\u00a0<ref>-(a) and \u00a0<ref>-(a)). \nWhile, for \ud835\udc9c_3^S_3, similar transient cooling is existent but the envelope narrows down with time (refer to Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(b)). The non-attainment of equilibrium is also another feature noted in both these cases.\n\nWe now compare the three-qubit quantum absorption refrigerator under the configuration, \ud835\udc9c_3^S_i, with the relevant two-qubit cases.\nWe saw previously that the configuration \ud835\udcac_1 does not provide a self-sustained two-qubit refrigerator. So we compare the two-qubit configuration,\ud835\udcac_2, with the three-qubit configuration, \ud835\udc9c_3^S_i.\nAgain, in the two-qubit case, refrigeration is possible only when E_1^2<1 while in the three-qubit setup, cooling occurs when E_1=E_3=1.\nBoth the cases depict a refrigeration effect without attaining equilibrium, although the envelope of the two plots are different. Compare Figs.\u00a0<ref>-(b) and \u00a0<ref>-(b).\n\n Next, we also consider a two-qubit situation where both the qubits are attached to spin-baths, i.e. the configuration is \ud835\udcac_3={B^NM_1,B^NM_2}. The local Hamiltonian is H^2=(E_1^2/2) \u03c3_z^(1)+(E_2^2/2) \u03c3_z^(2). The two qubits interact via the interaction H_1=|01\u27e9\u27e810|+|10\u27e9\u27e801|, under the self-sustained condition, E_1^2=E_2^2. We measure the final temperature of the first qubit, which exhibits only transient cooling at certain times, and the final temperature of the first qubit, T_1(t), sometimes rises above its initial temperature.  Fig.\u00a0<ref>, for example, depicts the case where E_1^2=0.1 and the spin-environment corresponds to N=1. Moreover, unlike the three-qubit case, cooling is not obtained here for E_1^2 \u2265 1.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Cooling of the cold qubit in the altered situation of \ud835\udc9c_4^S_i\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us now look into the case where the second and third qubits are connected to  non-Markovian spin-baths while the first one is Markovian, i.e., the setting \ud835\udc9c_4^S_i. Initially consider  the ideal scenario when all the three baths are Markovian within the parameter region of \ud835\udc12_1. Now if we replace the baths attached with the second and third qubits to non-Markovian ones, it is observed that steady state cooling is not obtained, and the refrigeration of the refrigerator is almost destroyed. See Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a). In this case, the oscillations vary between temperatures 0.9 and 1.02, with the minimum transient temperature being \u2248 0.9. The envelope of the oscillations gradually narrows down to a value greater that the initial temperature of the first qubit. Like in the previous subsection, here also the oscillations do not converge to a steady state within the observation period. \n\n\n\n\nWe now take the altered situation of \ud835\udc12_2, i.e. \ud835\udc9c_4^S_2. For this setting (same with \ud835\udc9c_4^S_3), \n\nwe observe that\n\nthe transient temperature of the cold qubit T_1(t) begins to oscillate between 0.9 and < 1.02 without attaining a steady state. So here also, the envelope of temperature oscillations vary with time and no enhancement of the transient state cooling is achieved over the ideal Markovian situation compared to \ud835\udc12_2. Compare Figs.\u00a0<ref>-(b) and\u00a0<ref>-(b). \n\n\n\n\n\nAn important feature to be noted here is that, like the situation of \ud835\udc9c_3^S_i with two of the baths made non-Markovian,\n\nhere also for \ud835\udc9c_4^S_i, the steady state is not attainable within the observation time. \nSo, unattainability of steady state is a general feature of m=1 and n=2 configurations, and it does not solely depends on the parameter space of the Markovian bath, which is coupled to any of the qubits.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we can conclude from the last two subsections that replacement of any two Markovian baths including the first one is beneficial as this  enhance the transient cooling, but the increase of non-Markovianity restrict the attainability of the steady state cooling. On the other hand, replacing any of the second or third Markovian baths or both of them by a non-Markovian one by keeping the cold qubit attached with a Markovian bath, results in a deterioration of performance  of the usual absorption refrigerator. So, one can attain a sufficient cooling of qubit-1 whenever it is connected to a non-Markovian environment, whatever be the nature of the baths attached to the other two. \n\nFinally, the analysis in this section infers that, the effect of non-Markovian baths on the quantum absorption refrigerator, results an enhancement in cooling attainable in transient as well as the steady state regime in some cases (if attainable), when the cold qubit is attached to a non-Markovian bath. We can call the quantum refrigerators with the beneficial altered setups as \u201cnon-Markovian quantum refrigerators\". This reduction of temperature of the cold qubit with this non-Markovian setups owes its origin to the non-Markovianity incorporated to the bath attached to the first qubit. This leads to define a quantifier of non-Markovianity for a quantum absorption refrigerator discussed in the next section.\n\n\n\u00a7 A MEASURE OF NON-MARKOVIANITY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have already shown that the efficiency of a quantum absorption refrigerator can be enhanced if the cold qubit is attached with a non-Markovian spin-bath, instead of a Markovian bosonic one. While for ideal Markovian situations (among of the three cases of ideal \ud835\udc12_1, \ud835\udc12_2 and \ud835\udc12_3), the transient and steady state temperatures attain \u2248 0.84 and \u2248 0.75 respectively, and a replacement of the Markovian bath attached to the cold qubit with a non-Markovian one, can reduce the respective transient and steady state temperatures to < 0.8 and \u2248 0.7. Let us try to find the origin of the decrease of temperature. As we concentrate on the temperature of qubit-1, from now on we will focus on the time dynamics of the first qubit only.\n\n\n\n\nLet us consider a two level system described by the Hamiltonian H=KE^'_0|0\u27e9\u27e80|+KE^'_1|1\u27e9\u27e81| and the initial state of the system, \u03c1^'(0), is taken to be diagonal in the eigenbasis of the \nHamiltonian. Now suppose, a non-Markovian channel N^t_NM is applied on the qubit for time t which results an evolution of the system, such that the density matrix of the state remains diagonal in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian. The corresponding density matrix is given by \u03c1^'_NM(t)=N^t_NM(\u03c1^'(0))=p(t)|0\u27e9\u27e80|+(1-p(t))|1\u27e9\u27e81|. Similarly, if the qubit evolves through a Markovian channel N^t_M, one can obtain the dynamical state as \u03c1^'_M(t)=N^t_M(\u03c1^'(0))=p^'(t)|0\u27e9\u27e80|+(1-p^'(t))|1\u27e9\u27e81|. The dynamical temperatures corresponding to the non-Markovian (T_NM^t) and Markovian (T_M^t) processes are defined through the following relations\n\n    \u27e80|\u03c1^'_NM(t)|0\u27e9 = e^-E'_0/ T_NM^t/e^-E'_0/ T_NM^t+e^-E'_1/T_NM^t= \u03b1_NM\n          \u27e80|\u03c1^'_M(t)|0\u27e9 = e^-E'_0/ T_M^t/e^-E'_0/T_M^t+e^-E'_1/T_M^t= \u03b1_M\n\nrespectively.\nInverting these equations, one arrives at \n\n    T_NM^t-T_M^t=(E'_0-E'_1)[ 1/ln(1/\u03b1_NM -1) - 1/ln(1/\u03b1_M -1)].\n\nIn this equation, the difference, T_NM^t-T_M^t, is a function of the parameters of the Markovian channel, \u03b1_1, \u03b1_2 and \u03b1_3. So the difference will vary with the choice of the channel parameters and may even give zero value corresponding to a particular choice of these three parameters. So we optimise over the channel parameters, \u03b1_1, \u03b1_2 and \u03b1_3, to give a generalized expression of the quantity in\u00a0<ref>.\nThus Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), with an optimisation over \u03b1_M, can be visualized as a measure of non-Markovianity of an arbitrary quantum channel C which manifests the deviation from its Markovian counterpart.\nWe therefore define the quantity,\n\n    M_C= |(E'_0-E'_1)[ 1/ln(1/\u03b1_C -1) - min_\u03b1_M1/ln(1/\u03b1_M -1)]|\n\nas a measure of non-Markovianity as this term quantifies the temperature difference of a system after passing through an arbitrary channel C, from the temperature obtained when passing through an optimal Markovian channel. \n\nThis quantifier M_C returns a positive value when the channel is non-Markovian, While for a Markovian channel, the quantifier is zero. \n\nWe now study the nature of the quantifier for \nthe configuration of bath, \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i, \n\nwith the parameter regions \ud835\udc9c_1^S_1=\ud835\udc9c_1^S_2 and \ud835\udc9c_1^S_3\n\nas  quantum channels, say C_1, C_2\n\nrespectively. The time dynamics of M_C_1 and M_C_2 are\n presented in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a) and Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(b)  (the green curves) respectively. For clarity, the quantifier M_C is scaled by a factor \u03b4=20 and plotted.\n\nBoth M_C_1 and M_C_2 \nshow similar features. \nThe two curves depict a small but positive value of the quantifier M_C when plotted against time. \nIt is thus evident that the system exhibits a non-Markovian behaviour within the observed timescale in the altered scenario, \ud835\udc9c_1^S_i. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a well established fact that the quantifiers of non-Markovianity are not all equivalent. So, here we consider a different measure of non-Markovianity, the Rivus-Huelga-Plenio (RHP) measure\u00a0<cit.>, to comment on the equivalence between the measure, M_C, with a widely used quantifier of non-Markovianity.\nSuppose we can split a dynamical map from 0 to t+\u03f5, with some intermediate time difference \u03f5, as\n\n    \u2130_(t+\u03f5,0)=\u2130_(t+\u03f5,t)\u2130_(t,0),\n\nwhere \u2130_(t+\u03f5,t) is a completely positive (CP) map, then the channel implemented by \u2130_(t+\u03f5,0) is Markovian.\n\nThe non-CP nature of \u2130_(t+\u03f5,t) is given by\n\n    g_\u2130(t)=lim_\u03f5\u2192 0^+f(t+\u03f5,t)-1/\u03f5,\n\nwhere\nf(t+\u03f5,t)=||(\u2130_(t+\u03f5,t)\u2297\ud835\udc08)(|\u03d5\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5|)||_1 with \u03f5 > 0. Here \u2130_(t+\u03f5,t) represents an arbitrary channel between times t and t+\u03f5, and ||A||_1 is the trace norm defined by \u221a(A^\u2020 A). The map, \u2130_(t+\u03f5,0), is said to be Markovian if and only if g_\u2130(t)=0, otherwise  g_\u2130(t)>0. Therefore, for a process to be non-Markovian, \nthe quantity, g_\u2130(t)>0. Here |\u03d5\u27e9 is a maximally entangled system-auxiliary state which is chosen to be 1/\u221a(2)(|00\u27e9_SA+|11\u27e9_SA) in this paper. \nThe orange curves in Fig.\u00a0<ref>-(a) and \u00a0<ref>-(b) \n\ndepict the behaviour of the RHP measure given in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) for the non-Markovian channel C.\n\n\n\n\nIf the dynamics of a non-Markovian evolution be governed by d\u03c1/dt=\u2112_t, then\nin the limit \u03f5\u2192 0, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) reduces to \n\n    g(t)=lim_\u03f5\u2192 0^+||[I+(\u2112_t \u2297I)\u03f5]|\u03d5\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5|||_1-1/\u03f5,\n\nwhere \u2130_(t+\u03f5,t)=e^\u2112_t \u03f5.\nThe orange curves in Fig.\u00a0<ref> has been plotted using this Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\nThe quantifier g_C(t) exhibits a positive value at a all times, which imply non-Markovianity in terms of the RHP measure at all timescales.\n\n\n\n\nFigures\u00a0<ref>-(a) and (b),\n\ndepict the non-Markovianity of the respective channels C_1 and C_2,\n\nas quantified by the new measure, M_C_i for i=1,2 (green curve), and the RHP measure (orange curve). \n\nComparing the green and orange curves in each of\u00a0<ref>-(a) and (b), it is noted that in the observed times, both M_C_i and g_C_i are positive, which implies that non-Markovianity is key feature of the system which is depicted by both the measures. Our measure, therefore, captures the non-Markovianity present in the system which is also evident in terms of the RHP measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 IMPACT OF MARKOVIAN NOISE ON A NON-MARKOVIAN QUANTUM REFRIGERATOR\n\n\nWe have already observed the enhancement in the efficiency of cooling of a quantum absorption refrigerator in some cases, while using non-Markovian baths instead of the Markovian ones for the ideal setups. Those altered situations, advantageous over the relevant Markovian cases,\n\nare idealistic, and environmental noise or fluctuations can have non-negligible effects on the efficiency of refrigeration, as noise is ubiquitous in nature. So, if we want to implement such an altered refrigerator model in reality, it is useful to look at the scenario in presence of decoherence noise. \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Noise model-I\n\n\nA quantum absorption refrigerator is constructed by a three-qubit three-bath setup. In ideal situations, all the three baths are Markovian and in some altered cases, the bath attached to the cold qubit can be non-Markovian.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHere we consider a three-qubit refrigerator in which the cold qubit is kept in a spin-environment (altered situation), along with being\n connected with a noisy Markovian environment, given by \ud835\udca9_1(\u00b7), where the argument is the altered refrigerator setup. In this paper, we have considered the noisy scenario \n\n\ud835\udca9_1(\ud835\udc9c_1^S_3) \n\n, where the cold qubit is coupled to a non-Markovian spin-bath taken in the previous discussions and also to a Markovian bosonic environment B^M_1. The other two qubits are connected to bosonic baths as before. \n\nTherefore the configuration is {B_1^NM,N_1,B_2^M,B_3^M},\nand the interaction Hamiltonian of the cold qubit and the Markovian environment B^M_1 is given by \n\n    H_SB^M_1=\u221a(g_1)\u222b_0^\u03a9\u0127\u221a(\u03c9\u0303)  d\u03c9  h_M_1(\u03c9)(\u03c3_- \u03b7_\u03c9^M_1\u2020+\u03c3_+\u03b7_\u03c9^M_1).\n\nHere g_1 is the dimensionless noise strength. All the other quantities are defined previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe modified GKSL master equation for this noisy scenario is same as Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), with an extra dissipative term coming from the contribution of noisy Markovain environment. So, the GKSL master equation for this noisy scenario turns out to be\n\n    \u2202\u03c1\u0303_s^\ud835\udca9_1(t)/\u2202 t=\u2202\u03c1\u0303_s(t)/\u2202 t+ \u0127/Kg_1\ud835\udc9f_M_1(\u03c1\u0303_s(t)).\n\nTaking this noisy environment into consideration, the additional system operators are given by\n\n    \ud835\udc9c^E_1_1 = (|111\u27e9\u27e8011|+|100\u27e9\u27e8000|)\u221a(2)\n          \ud835\udc9c^E_1+g_1 = (|110\u27e9\u27e8+|+|-\u27e9\u27e8001|)   \n          \ud835\udc9c^E_1-g_1 = (|+\u27e9\u27e8001|-|110\u27e9\u27e8-|).\n\nThe respective operators for the reverse processes is given by \ud835\udc9c^-\u03c9=\ud835\udc9c^\u03c9^\u2020.\n\nIf an isolated qubit interacts with a reservoir via the interaction given in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), then the time dynamics of the well-known amplitude damping channel is obtained for T_N_1=0.0, where T_N_1 is the temperature of the relevant bath.\n\n\nIn this case, we see that the system attains a steady state, and the temperature of the cold qubit at steady state is higher than the corresponding equilibrium temperature without the Markovian noise. If g_1 is made smaller \u2248 0.0001, then the steady state temperature is almost equal to the one corresponding to Fig\u00a0<ref>-(b), but is never less than that.\nSo the Markovian noise deteriorates the operation of the refrigerator when compared with the non-Markovian case, though its behaviour as a refrigerator is still retained within a finite domain of g_1. It has been numerically examined that this noise model never gives advantage over the non-Markovian scenario if g_1 is non-zero, keeping the other parameters fixed in the previously mentioned values.\n\nFig.<ref>-(a) depicts the scaling of the temperature difference between the cold qubit (T_1(t)) and the steady state temperature of Fig.(<ref>-(b)) (T_1^s) vs the noise strength g_1. The solid red curve is at time t=t_s=0.008 when the system is at equilibrium and the blue dashed line represents the nature at t=t_s/2. There is a finite gap between the two curves for small g_1, and the difference gradually reduces prior to when the system stops behaving as a refrigerator.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Noise model II\n\n\nIn this subsection, we repeat the same formalism followed in the previous subsection but in presence of a different Markovian noise. Here we consider the configuration \ud835\udca9_2(\ud835\udc9c_1^S_3).\nSo here, the first qubit is  kept in contact with a Markovian reservoir,  \ud835\udca9_2, in addition to the non-Markovian environment. Therefore the configuration is {B_1^NM,N_2,B_2^M,B_3^M}, and interaction between the system and the noisy bath, N_2, is given by\nH_SB^N_2 = g_2 \u2211_i=1^3 A_i\u2297 B_i, where\n\n    A_i\u2297 B_i = \u03c3_i \u2297\u222b_0^\u03c9_max\u0127\u221a(\u03c9\u0303) h_N_2(\u03c9) (a_\u03c9^\u2020+a_\u03c9) d\u03c9.\n\nHere \u03c3_i represents the three Pauli matrices for i=1,2,3, and h_N_2(\u03c9) is a dimensionless coupling parameter depending on \u03c9, which tunes the coupling between the coupling of  H_SB^N_2 to the rest of the Hamiltonian. \nAll other quantities are as defined previously.\n\n\n\n\nThe explicit expressions for the additional system operators due to the presence of the noise, \ud835\udca9_2, is given in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time dynamics of the well-known dephasing channel is restored if an isolated qubit interacts with a bath via H_SB^N_2, and the temperature of the bathT_N_2, is given by T_N_2\u2192\u221e.   \n\n In this situation also, the noise model does not improve the performance of the refrigerator when compared to the case where the first qubit is non-Markovian, but the refrigeration occurs within a range of the noise strength g_2. \n \nThe scaling of the temperature difference between the cold qubit T_1(t) in presence of the noise, \ud835\udca9_2, and the steady state temperature (T_1^s) of Fig.<ref>-(b) is shown in Fig.<ref>-(a), where the difference is plotted against the dimensionless noise strength g_2.\nThe steady state temperature at time t=t'_s=0.05 is depicted by the solid red curve whereas the blue dashed curve corresponds to the time t=t'_s/2. In contrast to the previous case, this graph has a trend that the difference between the red and blue curves gradually grows in magnitude with increasing g_2 until the value of g_2  crosses 0.009 where the model ceases to behave as a refrigerator.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSION\n\n\nIn this paper, we inspected a quantum refrigerator comprising of a few qubits, each of which are connected separately to \n\nlocal baths. We looked at situations where both TC and SSC coexist in  a quantum refrigerator system. We identified three domains, viz. where there is only TC, SSC better than TC, and TC better than SSC, considering different parameter regimes. \n\n\nAlong with\nthree-qubit quantum absorption refrigerators we also considered, for comparison and completeness,  single- and two-qubit self-sustained thermal devices in presence of one or more spin-environments. In the single- and two-qubit cases, we note that although cooling is obtained under certain conditions, the oscillations in the final temperature are persistent throughout, and the envelopes never converge to a steady state value. Whereas, the three-qubit refrigerator attains a steady state when at most one of the bosonic baths is replaced by a spin-environment.\n\nWe investigated the three-qubit absorption refrigerator for the three domains mentioned above, in presence of one or more spin-environments. We studied the system when the bath of a single qubit, two qubits or all the baths of the three qubits of the refrigerator are replaced by non-Markovian spin-baths.\n The core objective of this paper is to show that replacing the Markovian bath attached to the cold qubit of a refrigerator with a non-Markovian reservoir, results in a considerable lowering of the temperature of the cold qubit, compared to the situation when all the three baths are Markovian. This advantage is apparent both in the transient and steady states. Connecting the other two qubits with non-Markovian baths, while keeping the cold qubit in a Markovian reservoir, does not provide advantage over the scenario where all the three baths are Markovian.\n \nIn accordance with this result, we have also suggested a way to gauge how non-Markovian a channel is, by defining a measure of non-Markovianity by optimising over the channel parameters. Since noise permeates all physical processes, the refrigerator model has also been examined in the presence of Markovian noise in addition to the Markovian and non-Markovian baths.\nWe identified the range of noise strength for which refrigeration still occurs.\n\n\n We acknowledge computations performed using Armadillo\u00a0<cit.>,\n\n\n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n   and QIClib\u00a0<cit.>\n   \n   on the cluster computing facility of the Harish-Chandra Research Institute, India.
