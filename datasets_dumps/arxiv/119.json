For recent discussions of \nTSSAs measured in polarized collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion \nCollider (RHIC) and the possible mechanisms contributing to them, see \nRefs.\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nIn hadronic collisions involving a nucleus, the underlying partonic \norigins of the asymmetries could be affected by the presence of more \ncomplex quantum-chromodynamics environments. For example, relations \nbetween TSSAs and the physics of small parton momentum fractions have \nbeen proposed, in particular how comparisons of asymmetries measured in \nand collisions for forward hadron production could be used to \nprobe gluon saturation effects in the nucleus\u00a0<cit.>. \nFurther theoretical works have explored these \nideas\u00a0<cit.>. \nAt RHIC, TSSA measurements for proton-nucleus collisions have been \nperformed for forward charged hadrons\u00a0<cit.> and forward \nJ/\u03c8 mesons\u00a0<cit.> by PHENIX, and for forward \u03c0^0 \nproduction by STAR\u00a0<cit.>, revealing some nuclear \ndependencies that remain to be understood in detail. PHENIX has \nadditionally measured the TSSAs for far forward neutron production, with \nthe observed nuclear dependence of the asymmetries understood to be due \nto the interplay of hadronic and electromagnetic interactions in \nultra-peripheral collisions\u00a0<cit.>. No experimental \nmeasurements exist and very little theoretical work has been done to \nexplore possible nuclear effects for midrapidity TSSA observables, which \ncan only be studied at RHIC.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis brief article reports the first measurement of the TSSAs of neutral \npions and eta mesons in proton-Gold () and proton-Aluminum () \ncollisions at =200 GeV at midrapidity (|\u03b7|<0.35). The \ndata were taken in 2015 at RHIC and total integrated luminosities of \napproximately 202 and 690 nb^-1, respectively, were collected.\n\nMeasurements were performed with collisions of a vertically polarized \nproton beam on an ion beam (Au or Al). The proton or ion bunches are \nseparated by 106\u00a0ns in the RHIC rings. Each polarized proton bunch is \nassigned a polarization direction, either up or down, so that \nmeasurements with both spin directions can be performed nearly \nsimultaneously. This significantly reduces any possible systematic \nuncertainties related to the detector performance with time. The average \nproton beam polarization was 0.60 and 0.57 in and collisions respectively\u00a0<cit.>, with a relative \nuncertainty of 3% due to uncertainty in polarization normalization.\n\nThe data analysis procedure follows almost exactly from the recent TSSA \nmeasurement for \u03c0^0 and \u03b7 mesons in \u221a(s) = 200 GeV polarized \np+p collisions\u00a0<cit.>, with the distinction that only the proton \nbeam is polarized in collisions. Only events with a \ncollision z-vertex within \u00b1 30\u00a0 cm from the nominal collision \npoint were selected. The collision or minimum-bias trigger, as well \nas vertex position, were determined by two beam-beam counters (BBC) \nlocated at \u00b1 144\u00a0 cm from the nominal collision point along the \nbeam line, and covering the pseudorapidity range 3.1<|\u03b7|<3.9 with \nfull azimuthal coverage.\n\nNeutral pions and eta mesons were reconstructed through their two-photon \ndecay in the electromagnetic calorimeters (EMCal) of PHENIX. The EMCal \nis located in two nearly back-to-back central arm spectrometers (west \nand east), each covering \u0394\u03d5=\u03c0/2 in azimuth and \u00b10.35 in \npseudorapidity. The EMCal comprises two types of calorimeters, six \nsectors of sampling lead-scintillator (PbSc) calorimeter and 2 sectors \nof \u010cerenkov lead-glass (PbGl) \ncalorimeter\u00a0<cit.>.  The two calorimeter systems have \ndifferent granularity \n(\u0394\u03d5\u00d7\u0394\u03b7 =0.011 \u00d7 0.011 \nin PbSc and 0.008 \u00d7 0.008 in PbGl) and also have a \ndifferent response to charged hadrons, which provides important \nsystematic cross-checks for the measurement.\n\nThe PHENIX EMCal was also used to generate a high-photon trigger to \ntag events with a high-energy cluster in the EMCal. The high-photon \ntrigger (with an energy threshold of 1.5 GeV) in coincidence with a \nminimum-bias trigger was used to collect the and \u03b7 statistics \nin this analysis. The efficiency of such a trigger for 's increased \nfrom 20% at =3 to 90% at >6, with the plateaued \nefficiency level defined by the acceptance of the live trigger tiles.\n\nPhotons were identified in the EMCal by placing selection criteria on \nthe shower profile and time-of-flight (TOF) with | TOF| < 5 \nns, and with a minimum energy selection of 0.5 GeV to reduce the \ncontribution from electronic noise in the EMCal, and combinatorial \nbackground in \u03c0^0 and \u03b7 reconstruction.  A charged track veto \nwas also implemented to eliminate clusters that are geometrically \nassociated with a track, in order to suppress the background from \nelectrons and charged hadrons. Photon pairs were reconstructed by \nfinding a high-p_T trigger photon, and pairing it with another \nphoton from the same event and spectrometer arm. Photon pairs passing an \nenergy-asymmetry requirement: \u03b1 = |E_1 - E_2|/(E_1+E_2)<0.8 were \nselected for further analysis. \n\nfig:invmass shows the two-photon invariant mass distributions \naround the and \u03b7 peaks for photon pairs within 4<p_T<5 \nGeV/c in the west central arm spectrometer for and collisions.  The and \u03b7 meson yields were defined to be within \nthe signal-invariant mass window ([blue] leftward-hatched regions in \nfig:invmass) of \u00b1\u00a025 and \u00b1\u00a070 MeV/c^2 from the and \u03b7 mass peaks, respectively, in the two-photon invariant mass \ndistribution for each bin. The side-band regions used to approximate \nthe combinatorial background under the signal peak ([red] \nrightward-hatched regions in fig:invmass) are defined as 47\u201397 \nand 177\u2013227 MeV/c^2 for the and 300\u2013400 and 700\u2013800 \nMeV/c^2 for the \u03b7 mesons.  The same signal and side-band regions \nwere used in a previous PHENIX analysis\u00a0<cit.>. The combinatorial \nbackground for the two-photon invariant mass spectrum (described by a \nthird-order polynomial and shown as the [green] solid lines in \nfig:invmass) was used to quantify the fraction of background \nexisting under the signal peaks.  For the , this ranged from 14% \n(13%) to 6% (6%) from the lowest to the highest bins in () collisions, while for the \u03b7, the combinatorial background \nunder the signal peak ranged from 79% (77%) to 48% (43%) in () collisions.\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\nSimilar to the recent p+p \u03c0^0 and \u03b7 TSSA \nanalysis\u00a0<cit.>, the transverse single-spin asymmetry A_N is \ndetermined with the \u201crelative-luminosity\u201d formula, which is calculated \nseparately for the two detector arms.  This yields measurements from two \nindependent data sets that are verified for consistency and then averaged \nto obtain the final result. The equation for the relative-luminosity \nTSSA is\n\n    A_N = 1/P<cos(\u03d5)>N^\u2191-\u211bN^\u2193/N^\u2191+\u211bN^\u2193,\n\nwhere P is the beam polarization, and \u211b is the relative \nluminosity, defined as the ratio of integrated luminosities between the \nbunches with \u2191 and \u2193 spin states. \n<cos(\u03d5)> is the acceptance factor which reflects the \ndetector azimuthal coverage, calculated separately for each p_T bin \nand spectrometer arm, and N refers to the yields, with the arrows \nreferring to the up (\u2191) or down (\u2193) polarization of \nthe proton beam.\n\nAnother method to calculate the asymmetry is the \u201csquare-root\u201d \nformula, which is used as a cross-check. The square-root formula is \ndefined as\n\n    A_N = 1/P<cos(\u03d5)>\u221a(N_L^\u2191N_R^\u2193)-\u221a(N_L^\u2193N_R^\u2191)/\u221a(N_L^\u2191N_R^\u2193)+\u221a(N_L^\u2193N_R^\u2191),\n\nand it is used to calculate the asymmetry for both spectrometer arms \nsimultaneously, where the L and R subscripts of N correspond to \nyields measured in the left and right detector arms respectively, with \nrespect to the polarized-proton-going direction. This results in only \none measurement of A_N that can be compared with the weighted \naverage of the left and right relative-luminosity asymmetry calculation. \nThe comparison showed that results using eq:relan and \neq:sqrtan were statistically consistent, with any deviations \nassigned as a conservative systematic uncertainty.\n\nAs an additional cross-check, the TSSA is calculated as a function of \n\u03d5, in which case a cosine modulation is fit to extract the \nasymmetry. This was found to be statistically consistent with the main \nasymmetry results.\n\nThe measured asymmetries were corrected for the background as follows, \n\n    A_N^ sig = A_N-r \u00b7 A_N^ BG/1-r,\n\nwhere r is the background fraction under the or \u03b7 peaks, \ncalculated from the background fits ([green] solid lines) shown in \nfig:invmass. A_N^ BG is the background asymmetry, which was \nevaluated from the side bands on both sides of the and \u03b7 \npeaks, also shown in fig:invmass. The background asymmetry was \nconsistent with zero in all bins and all collision systems for both \nthe and \u03b7 mesons.\n\nAsymmetries were calculated separately for each accelerator fill, during \nwhich the detector performance and beam conditions are considered to be \nrelatively stable. The final asymmetry was obtained from the weighted \naverage over the accelerator fills.\n\nThe possible sources of systematic uncertainties considered are 1) the \nbackground contribution r in eq:sb, and 2) possible variation in \ndetector performance and beam conditions. A systematic uncertainty on \nthe background fraction is quantified by varying the fit ranges used to \ncalculate r, and computing how much the background corrected asymmetry \nchanges. The variations in detector performance and beam conditions were \ntested with a technique known as \u201cbunch shuffling,\u201d and from the \ncomparison of the results calculated with the \u201crelative-luminosity \nformula\" eq:relan and the \u201csquare-root formula\" eq:sqrtan. \nThe asymmetries calculated with the different formulas were found to be \nstatistically consistent, but a conservative systematic uncertainty is \nstill applied based on the difference. In the bunch shuffling procedure, \nthe polarization of each bunch is randomly assigned to be up or down, \nand a distribution of A_N in each p_T bin is obtained by repeating \nthe procedure 10,000 times\u00a0<cit.>. While most p_T \nbins were found to be consistent with the statistical variation, some of \nthe lower p_T bins for both the \u03c0^0 and the \u03b7 in both \ncollision systems included up to 15% variation beyond what was expected \nfrom statistical fluctuations. To account for this effect, an additional \nsystematic uncertainty was assigned in any p_T bin showing \nvariations significantly beyond expected statistical fluctuations.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n\nfig:ANpT shows the measurement of A_N for and \u03b7 \nmesons in and collisions at = 200 GeV. The measured \nasymmetries in and are consistent with zero across the \nentire range for both the and \u03b7 mesons. \nTable\u00a0<ref> lists the asymmetries, statistical \nuncertainties, and total systematic uncertainties for the \u03c0^0 and \n\u03b7 mesons in and collisions.\n\nThe TSSA measurements presented here probe the complex dynamics of \npartons within a nucleus. Measurements of asymmetries with heavy nuclei \nhave not been performed at collider energies before 2015. \nTherefore, it is unclear to what extent the nuclear environment affects \nTSSAs. Collisions with a nucleus explore spin-momentum correlations in \nan environment where larger multiplicities and stronger color fields \ncould play an additional role. In a factorized picture, initial-state \nspin-momentum correlations in the polarized proton cannot be affected by \nthe presence of a nucleus; however, it is possible for final-state \nspin-momentum correlations in the process of hadronization to be \naffected as the scattered parton passes through the nuclear matter. \nAllowing for factorization-breaking effects, the larger color field of \nthe nuclear remnant in collisions as compared to the proton remnant \nin collisions could potentially modify the observed \nasymmetries\u00a0<cit.>. Neutral-pion \nmeasurements in the forward region\u00a0<cit.> and \ncharged-hadron measurements in the intermediate rapidity \nregion\u00a0<cit.> show sizable TSSAs in collisions, with \nmoderate nuclear modifications in for the former and \nstrong nuclear modifications in for the latter. In \ncontrast, the \u03c0^0 and \u03b7 meson asymmetries at midrapidity are \nconsistent with zero in all collision systems, showing no difference \nbetween and collisions. \n\n\n\n\u00a7 SUMMARY\n\n\nThe data presented here were motivated by the outstanding questions \nregarding the physical origin of transverse single-spin asymmetries. The \nTSSAs of midrapidity and \u03b7 mesons were measured in , and \ncollisions at =200 GeV by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC.  \nThe measured asymmetries are consistent with zero up to very high \nprecision in both collision systems for both meson species. The data \npresented here will contribute to the understanding of transverse spin \nphenomena in the more complex environment present in proton-nucleus \ncollisions. In particular, we find that at midrapidity the presence of a \nheavy nucleus in the collision does not significantly modify the \nmagnitude of the measured TSSAs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe thank the staff of the Collider-Accelerator and Physics\nDepartments at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the staff of\nthe other PHENIX participating institutions for their vital\ncontributions.  \nWe acknowledge support from the Office of Nuclear Physics in the\nOffice of Science of the Department of Energy,\nthe National Science Foundation,\nAbilene Christian University Research Council,\nResearch Foundation of SUNY, and\nDean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Vanderbilt University\n(U.S.A),\nMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology\nand the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Japan),\nNatural Science Foundation of China (People's Republic of China),\nCroatian Science Foundation and\nMinistry of Science and Education (Croatia),\nMinistry of Education, Youth and Sports (Czech Republic),\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Commissariat\n\u00e0 l'\u00c9nergie Atomique, and Institut National de Physique\nNucl\u00e9aire et de Physique des Particules (France),\nJ.
