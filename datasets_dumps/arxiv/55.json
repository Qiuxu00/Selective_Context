It has recently emerged as an active research topic due to its interest in structural geology and engineering. The growing interest stems from its engineering applications in subsurface energy technologies, including enhanced geothermal energy systems where the hydro-shearing technique is aimed to reactivate and slide the preexisting fracture network to increase the rock mass permeability <cit.>, large-scale CO_2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers <cit.>, impoundment and level changes of artificial water reservoirs of hydropower plants <cit.> and underground natural gas storage facilities <cit.>, where their mechanics are crucial to understanding the stability of faults and hence earthquake mechanisms <cit.>. Other engineering applications include fault and slope stability assessment <cit.>, or the stability of faults during the groundwater injection and production operations <cit.>.\n\n\n\nThe simulation of shear fracturing processes is a challenging task. The finite element method (FEM) has been the dominant numerical method for modeling solids and continua. Classically, two fundamentally different perspectives are proposed to study compressive fractures using FEM:\n\n\n  - Discrete fracture models (DFM) that are based on the classical theory of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) founded by <cit.>. \n\n  - Smeared fracture models (SFM) that are based on the classical theory of Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) proposed initially by <cit.>.\n\nEach class includes extensive literature dating back to the 1960s that is out of the scope of this text to cover comprehensively. Therefore we only point the interested reader to a few primary studies of each class. \n\nWithin the DFM realm, common approaches include node duplication on fracture interface <cit.>, strong discontinuity approaches <cit.>, and Extended Finite Element Methods (XFEM) <cit.>. \nThese methods require using geometrical algorithms to trace the fracture propagation, which has been found very challenging for generic three-dimensional setups. Such methods are efficient for modeling single fractures. However, they become quickly impractical when dealing with complex fracture nucleation and propagation patterns. \n\nAs per the SFMs, we can point to continuum damage models (CDM) <cit.>, peridynamic models <cit.>, and phase-field models (PFM) <cit.>, which we discuss next in more details. \nWhile early models showed significant mesh dependencies, these models have been used to simulate very complex fracture patterns under realistic conditions. Among this class, phase-field models have been most attractive in recent years due to their thermodynamically sound foundations and their ability to model complex fracture patterns. \n\n\nPhase-field models have been extensively used for modeling brittle, cohesive, and ductile Mode-I fracture patterns, in elastic or poroelastic materials and homogeneous or heterogeneous domains <cit.> <cit.>. \nAlthough  proposed a simple extension for shear fractures, the applicability of phase-field for modeling shear failure remained virtually untouched until very recently <cit.>. In a detailed study,  presented a phase-field formulation of frictional fracture based on  theory and using a similar stress decomposition approach to the one proposed by  for tensile cracks. The authors validated their model on a set of classical problems as well as various experimental setups <cit.>.\n\n\nIn the present study, we propose a phase field model of shear failure that adapts the cohesive model of shear fractures proposed by  for deviatoric stress decomposition (DSD) instead of the proposed contact stress decomposition (CSD). Hence, we arrive at an alternative descriptor for the shear fracture orientation (i.e., the \u03b1 tensor) which is solely based on the deviatoric strain. We adapt the crack driving force to be consistent with the DSD decomposition. The resulting formulation simplifies the damage criterion since it results in damaging the shear modulus. Lastly, the proposed model allows us to use the general forms of the failure functions from the classical plasticity theory and therefore is not limited to Mohr-Coulomb failure model.\n\nIn what follows, we first briefly describe the original framework based on CSD. We then discuss our generalization proposal. Lastly, we use both frameworks to model a set of benchmark problems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PHASE-FIELD METHOD\n\nIn this section, we first describe the general phase-field framework for modeling crack propagation in materials. We then summarize the most recent CSD shear model <cit.>. Finally, we discuss our proposed adjustment for better stability. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Phase-field governing equations\n\n\nConsider the continua \u03a9\u2208\u211d^D in D-dimensional space, depicted in <Ref>, with its boundary represented as \u0393. The boundary \u0393 is subjected to Neumann boundary conditions on \u0393_t and Dirichlet boundary conditions on \u0393_u, where \u0393_u \u222a\u0393_t = \u0393 and \u0393_u \u2229\u0393_t = \u2205. The set of discontinuities in the domain is represented by a discrete surface \u0393_d. \n\nAccording to the phase-field formulation, the fracture's discrete surface \u0393_d is approximated implicitly as a continuous function over a width l using the Allen-Cahn fracture surface density function \u03b3(d) as\n\n    \u03b3(d) = 1/c_0 l( w(d) + l^2 \u2207 d ^2 ),   with   c_0 = 4\u222b_0^1 \u221a(w(l)) dl\n\nwhere d is the phase-field variable, with d=0 presenting the intact part of the domain while d=1 expressing a point on \u0393_d. \nw(d) is the transition function, also known as the dissipation function, defined for cohesive cracks as w(d)=d <cit.>, hence c_0=8/3. Accordingly, a surface integral \u222b ds is approximated using a volume integral as \u222b ds \u2248\u222b\u03b3(d)\u00a0dv.\n\nGiven the displacement field u, the small-deformation strain measure =(\u2207u + \u2207u^T)/2, and the crack surface density function \u03b3(d), the total energy of a fractured continua, occupying the domain \u03a9 and bounded by the boundary \u0393, shown in <Ref>, is expressed as \n\n    \u03a8 = -\u03a8^external + \u03a8^internal + \u03a8^fracture,\n\nwhere, \u03a8^external is the work done by the external traction stress \u03c4 and body force b, and expressed as \n\n    \u03a8^external   = \u222b_\u0393_tu\u00b7\u03c4\u00a0ds + \u222b_\u03a9u\u00b7b\u00a0dv.\n\nThe fracture energy, i.e., \u03a8^fracture, is the energy dissipated from the system to create a fracture surface \u0393_d. Given the energy release rate G_c (per unit fracture length), \u03a8^fracture is expressed as  \n\n    \u03a8^fracture   = \u222b_\u0393_dG_c \u00a0ds \u2248\u222b_\u03a9G_c \u03b3(d)\u00a0dv.\n\n\nThe stored internal energy of the system \u03a8^internal consists of the elastic stored energy in the intact part of the domain and stored energy in the damaged part of the domain, expressed as \n\n    \u03a8^internal   = \u222b_\u03a9\u03c8(, d)\u00a0dv.\n\nThe internal energy density function \u03c8(, d) is defined as \u03c8(,d) = 12 :, which consists of both inactive and damaged counterparts. For the intact part of continuum, i.e., where d=0, the Cauchy stress tensor (, d=0) is expressed using Hook's law as\n\n    (, d=0) = (\u03ba-2/3\u03bc) \u03b5_v 1 + 2\u03bc,\n\nwhere, \u03ba and \u03bc are bulk and shear moduli of the intact material, respectively, and \u03b5_v is the volumetric strain, expressed as \u03b5_v = (). For the parts of the domain where d > 0, the Cauchy stress tensor is  decomposed into inactive part ^I and active part ^A as \n\n    (, d)    = ^I() + ^A(,d) \n       = ^I() + g(d) () + (1-g(d))().\n\nThe active part of the stress tensor undergoes the damage process, and g(d) is a degradation function that expresses the stress transition from bulk () to fracture (). We will discuss these in more details in the next sections. \n\nTherefore, there are two solution variables associated with the phase-field formulation, the standard displacement field u and the additional phase-field variable d. Taking the variation of \u03a8 with respect to u and d, and following the standard weak to strong form steps of the FEM <cit.> and phase-field <cit.>, we can arrive at the following governing relations: \n\n\n    \u2207\u00b7(,d) + b = 0, \n       3G_c/8l(2l^2\u2207^2 d - 1) - g'(d) H() = 0.\n\nThe irreversibility of the fracture process is guaranteed with the local history field of maximum stored shear energy H^+() that allows us to solve the constrained minimization of <ref> in a straightforward way <cit.> and avoids unphysical self-healing. H^+() is defined as follows:\n\n    H^+() = max_s\u2208[0,t]( H() ),\n\nwhere t is time. <Ref> is then rewritten as follows:\n\n    3G_c/8l(2l^2\u2207^2 d - 1) - g'(d) H^+() = 0.\n\nSince \u1e22\u22650, non-negative \u1e0b is guaranteed and, consequently, the irreversibility of the fracture growth. We define H() after describing the stress decomposition approach. \n\nIn this work, we use the Lorenz degradation function g(d) defined as  <cit.>:\n\n    g(d, p) = (1-d)^2/(1-d)^2 + M/\u03c8_cd(1+p d)\n\nwhere, M=G_c/(c_0 l) and \u03c8_c is the critical crack driving force at the material's peak strength, evaluated as \u03c8_c = -M w'(0)/g'(0). The damage begins to accumulate as soon as elastic stored energy exceeds this critical threshold. Here, we take p=1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Stress decomposition. Introduction\n\n\nThe split of the strain energy density into crack driving and intact components defines the damage mode and fracture pattern. Up to date, two fundamental approaches are available. \nThe approaches of the first class do not take into account the local fracture orientation, whereas the second approaches take into consideration the local crack orientation.\n\nThe first group of models includes the isotropic model, the volumetric and deviatoric decomposition model, the spectral decomposition model, or the anisotropic models. The isotropic model proposed by  where the entire strain energy density is degraded. The volumetric and deviatoric decomposition model proposed by  splits the strain tensor into its volumetric and deviatoric components. This approach avoids crack inter-penetration in composites and masonry structures. The fracture is then assumed to be driven by volumetric expansion and deviatoric strains. The spectral decomposition model proposed by  splits the strain tensor into its principal components and only tensile components drive the fracture propagation. The anisotropic models are based on the spectral decomposition of the strain tensor using other projections, such as the eigenvalue and eigenvector of the effective stress tensor <cit.>. \n\n\nThe second group of approaches take into consideration the local crack orientation. The directional model proposed by\u00a0 splits the stress tensor into the crack driving and persistent components using the fracture orientation. For each point, a fracture coordinate system is defined and the fracture orientation is obtained from the maximum principal stress direction. \u00a0 and\u00a0 computed the fracture orientation from the phase-field gradients. Following this way to compute the fracture direction,\u00a0 developed a phase field model based on micromechanical modeling,\u00a0i.e., the macroscopic fracture is modeled as a collection of microscopic fractures.\n\nIn the following subsections, we describe the contact stress decomposition (CSD), used satisfactorily to simulate shear fractures under confining pressures, and lastly we present our proposal based on the deviatoric stress decomposition (DSD). \nBoth models do not take into account the local fracture orientation.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Contact stress decomposition (CSD)\n\n\nSince a compressive fracture behaves like a contact problem,  proposed a stress decomposition approach that is closely related to the contact formulation, which we refer here as CSD. It starts by considering a corotational coordinate system on the fracture surface with m and n as tangential and normal vectors to the crack surface, and m along the direction of sliding. Additionally, let us define \u03b1 = (mn + nm)/2. \n\nAccording to this approach and under the assumption that the fracture remains closed, i.e., no tensile fracture, the only stress component that should undergo damage is the shear stress, and other stress components remain inactive. The bulk shear stress can be expressed as  \n\n    \u03c4\u0302   = :\u03b1 = \u03bc\u03b5_\u03b3,\n\nwhere, \u03b5_\u03b3 = 2\u00a0:\u03b1 = 2\u00a0m\u00b7\u00b7n. Consider the contact shear stress as \u03c4\u0303. Then, the inactive stress tensor is expressed as \n\n    ^I = (, d=0) - \u03bc\u03b5_\u03b3\u00a0\u03b1,\n\nand the active stress tensor as \n\n    ^A = \u03c4^A \u03b1,   where  \u03c4^A = \u03bc\u03b5_\u03b3\u00a0g(d)+ \u03c4\u0303\u00a0(1-g(d)).\n\nHere, \u03c4\u0303 is the residual contact stress while the fracture is fully developed, i.e., d=1. \n\n\n\n\nGiven the Mohr-Coulomb's failure function as, \n\n    F = |\u03c4| - \u03c3_ntan\u03d5 - c = 0\n\nwith \u03c3_n=n\u00b7\u00b7n as to normal stress on the fracture surface, and c and \u03d5 as cohesion and friction angle of the intact material, the peak and residual shear stresses are expressed as \n\n    \u03c4\u0303_p = c + \u03c3_n tan(\u03d5),   \u03c4\u0303_r = c_r + \u03c3_n tan(\u03d5_r),\n\nwhere c_r and \u03d5_r are residual friction and cohesion at the fully developed failure state.\n\n\n\nBased on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, the critical plane for the failure is evaluated at two conjugate angles \u03b8 = \u00b1(45^\u2218 - \u03d5_r/2) <cit.> with respect to the direction of the maximum principal stress. However, the authors only consider \u03b8 = +(45^\u2218 - \u03d5_r/2) <cit.>. This restriction is required otherwise m,n is not uniquely defined. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Our proposal: deviatoric stress decomposition (DSD)\n\n\nThe total strain tensor can be decomposed into volumetric and deviatoric parts, as = \u03b5_v1 + e. We can also express the Cauchy tensor in terms of the mean confining stress p and the deviatoric stress tensor s as = -p1 + s. Therefore, we can  re-write Hook's law for the intact part as <cit.> \n\n    (, d=0) \n    = -p1 + s = \u03ba\u00a0\u03b5_v 1 + 2\u03bce.\n\nGiven the equivalent deviatoric (Mises) stress q = (3/2s:s)^1/2 and the equivalent deviatoric strain \u03b5_q = (2/3e:e)^1/2 and with some algebra, we can write that \n\n    q = 3\u03bc\u03b5_q.\n\nLet us now define the Unit Deviator Tensor \u03b1_q as\n\n    \u03b1_q = \u221a(2/3)e/\u03b5_q,  where  \u03b1_q = \u221a(\u03b1_q:\u03b1_q) = 1,\n\nHook's law can therefore be expressed as \n\n    \u03c3 = -p1 + \u221a(2/3)q\u03b1_q,   where  p = \u03ba\u03b5_v, \u00a0\u00a0q = 3\u03bc\u03b5_q.\n\n\nEquivalent to the CSD, we can describe the compressive failure in a material as damage in the deviatoric stress component. Therefore, the compressive pressure becomes the inactive part of the stress tensor, i.e.,\n\n    ^I = -p1 = \u03ba\u03b5_v1,\n\nand active stress is described as \n\n    ^A = q(, d) \u03b1_q,   where   q(, d) = g(d) q\u0302 + (1-g(d)) q\u0303_r,\n\nwhere the bulk deviatoric stress is q\u0302 = 3\u03bc\u03b5_q. \n\n\n\nThis deviatoric stress decomposition allows us to leverage the general form of virtually any failure surface that are described in the classical plasticity theory, including the Mohr-Coulomb failure function. Given the friction angle \u03d5 and cohesion coefficient c, the general form of the Mohr-Coulomb's failure criterion is expressed as\n\n    F = R_MCq - ptan\u03d5 - c = 0.\n\nHere, R_MC defines the shape of the Mohr-Coulomb's failure surface and is expressed as \n\n    R_MC = 1/\u221a(3)cos\u03d5sin(\u0398 + \u03c0/3) + 1/3cos(\u0398 + \u03c0/3)tan\u03d5,\n\nwhere \u0398 is the Lod\u00e8 angle, evaluated as cos(3\u0398) = (r/q)^3. The invariant r is the third invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, and is defined as r = (9/2tr(s^3))^1/3. \nBased on this criterion, we can find the peak and residual Mises stresses as \n\n    q\u0303_p = ptan\u03d5 + c/R_MC,   q\u0303_r = ptan\u03d5_r + c_r/R_MC,\n\nwith \u03d5_r and c_r as the residual values for friction angle and cohesion at the fully damaged state. \n\n\n\nWe can easily replace the non-smooth Mohr-Coulomb surface R_MC with some alternatives <cit.>. In fact, we can potentially pick any alternative failure function available for different materials. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Crack driving force\n\n\nGiven \u03c4 = \u03bc\u03b5_\u03b3 and \u03c4_p = p tan\u03d5 + c = \u03bc\u03b5_\u03b3^p, the crack driving force relations for CSD is derived as <cit.>\n\n    H = H_t + H_slip\n\nwhere\n\n    H_t = \u03c4\u0303_p - \u03c4\u0303_r/2\u03bc, \n       H_slip = 1/2\u03bc[ (\u03c4\u0302 - \u03c4\u0303_r)^2 - (\u03c4\u0303_p - \u03c4\u0303_r)^2 ]\n\nand they showed that this model is consistent with  model. \nNow, for the deviatoric stress decomposition discussed above, we can revise the crack driving force, given q\u0302 = 3\u03bc\u03b5_q and q\u0303_p = (p tan\u03d5 + c)/R_MC = 3\u03bc\u03b5_q^p, as\n\n    H_t = (q\u0303_p - q\u0303_r)^2/6\u03bc, \n       H_slip = 1/6\u03bc[ (q\u0302 - q\u0303_r)^2 - (q\u0303_p - q\u0303_r)^2 ] .\n\nMore details on the derivation of H_t and H_slip for CSD approach are provided in <Ref>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Boundary conditions\n\nTo have a complete mathematical description of the problem, we lastly need to describe the boundary conditions. Considering <Ref>, the boundary conditions are described as \n\n    u = u\u0305,      on  \u0393_u, \n    \u03c4 = \u00b7n = \u03c4\u0305,      on  \u0393_t, \n    \u2207 d\u00b7n = 0,      on  \u0393,\n\nwhere u\u0305 and \u03c4\u0305 are prescribed displacement and traction forces, respectively. \n\nThe steps used to solve the problem are detailed in Algorithm 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 APPLICATIONS TO COMPRESSIVE STRAIN LOCALIZATION\n\n\nHere, we consider three reference problems of shear fractures, including direct shear test, biaxial compression test, and slope failure analysis. We show that our model can effectively capture multiple modes of failure concurrently. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Direct shear test\n\n\n\nOur first example is the direct shear test. We simulate the propagation of a fracture in a long shear apparatus and we compare our results with analytical solutions and Fei and Choo's numerical simulations\u00a0<cit.>. \nThe setup of the experiment is plotted in <Ref>. The domain is 500 mm long, 100 mm tall, and an initial 10-mm horizontal fracture is carved in the middle of the left boundary. The boundary conditions are: the bottom boundary is fixed, the top boundary is displaced horizontally, and the two lateral boundaries are fixed vertically. We neglect gravity. \n\nThe material properties are: shear modulus G=10 MPa, Poisson's ratio \u03bd=0.3, cohesion strength c=40 kPa, peak and residual friction angle \u03d5=\u03d5_r=15^\u2218, shear fracture energy \ud835\udca2_c=30 J/m^2, and fracture's length-scale l=2 mm. As in the previous works of  and , we impose the fracture propagation to be horizontal. Following Fei and Choo's simulations\u00a0<cit.>, we initialize vertical compressive normal stress to 149 kPa, which results in \u03c4_p=80 kPa and \u03c4_r=40 kPa. We mesh the domain near the fracture path with a mapped squared mesh of size l/4=0.5 mm and the remaining domain with a 1-mm free triangular mesh.\n\nThe horizontal force-displacement curve is shown in <Ref>. The agreement of the peak and residual forces provided by our numerical simulation is very satisfactory.\nTheoretically, the peak load, i.e., the peak shear stress times the width of the specimen, is 40 kN, and the output of our simulation is 40.387 kN. In the same way, the theoretical residual load is 20 kN and the output of our simulation is 19.978 kN. We estimate the fracture energy from the force-displacement curve, the shaded area in <Ref>. The output of our model provides a fracture energy equal to 14.6914 J, while the theoretical value is 15 J. Therefore, we report a remarkable agreement between our simulations and expected theoretical values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe analyze the sensitivity of our model to the phase-field length parameter, l. We run several simulations of the direct shear test problem for several values of l, ranging from 1 mm to 10 mm. Results are depicted in <Ref>(a). The force-displacement curves for the four values of l confirm that the model is virtually insensitive to the phase-field length parameter. We check the mesh dependency of our model by running three problems of the long-shear apparatus problem. We fix the ratio length scale parameter to mesh size, l/h, to 20 and we run three simulations for three l- and h-values. Results are plot in <Ref>(b). The curves confirm that the model is insensible to the mesh size.\n\n\n\n\nWe plot the phase-field distribution at three time steps in <Ref>. The peak load is given for U_x=0.8083 mm, after this value is reached the phase-field has already emerged and propagate along the whole fracture, <Ref> (a). Afterward, the phase-field value intensifies during the softening stage, <Ref> (b), up to the time the fracture is completely developed, <Ref> (c). At this time, the domain is split into two parts. The upper part slips over the bottom one, and the shear stress between both parts is constant and equal to the residual shear stress, \u03c4_r=40 kPa, resulting in a theoretical horizontal force of 20 kN.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Biaxial compression test\n\nOur next example is a biaxial compression test. We simulate a laboratory-size specimen under plane strain, different confining pressures and with different residual friction angles. This example allows us to show the ability of the model to simulate the pressure dependence of the peak and residual strengths. We compare our numerical results with peak and residual strengths computed with a mechanical equilibrium model before and after the rupture.\n\nThe model setup is shown in <Ref>(a). The domain is 80-mm wide and 170-mm tall rectangular. The bottom boundary is supported by rollers, whereas a prescribed vertical displacement is imposed in the top boundary and zero horizontal displacement in the top middle point. The two lateral boundaries are subjected to the confining pressure, p_c, which is constant during the experiment. \n\nThe material properties are: shear modulus G=10 MPa, Poisson's ratio \u03bd=0.3, cohesion strength c=40 kPa, peak friction angle \u03d5=15^\u2218, shear fracture energy \ud835\udca2_c=30 J/m^2, and fracture's length-scale l=2 mm. We neglect gravity. We simulate three cases of p_c, 50 kPa, 100 kPa, and 200 kPa, and repeat each case with three values of the residual friction angles, \u03d5_r=20^\u2218, 15^\u2218, and 0^\u2218. These simulations let us check whether our model captures the pressure dependence of the peak and residual strengths. We discretize the domain with a free triangular mesh with size h=0.2 mm that satisfy l/h=10.\n\n\n\nWe include two typical vertical force-displacement curves in <Ref>(b). The confining pressure is p_c=200 kPa, the peak friction angle is \u03d5=20^\u2218, and we consider two residual friction angles, \u03d5_r=20^\u2218 and 0^\u2218. Initially, both vertical forces change linearly with the imposed vertical displacement until the peak strength is reached. The peak strength is the same in both models since they have the same p_c, c, and \u03d5. \nAfterward the fracture propagates suddenly across the domain, reaching both lateral boundaries, and the vertical force suddenly sinks. Our numerical model is able to capture the fracture propagation during the transition from the peak to the residual strengths due to the adaptive time step. Moreover, the curves evidence that the phase-field model is able to simulate the residual strength, which depends on the confining pressure, the residual friction angle, and the fracture path. \n\n\n\nWe run several simulations of the biaxial compression problem for several values of l, ranging from 1 mm to 10 mm. The force-displacement curves for the four values of l are included in Figure\u00a0<ref>. As in the previous problem, the curves for the values of l confirm that the model is virtually insensitive to the phase-field length parameter.\n\n\nThe evolution of the phase-field variable for p_c=200 kPa, \u03d5=20^\u2218, and \u03d5_r=20^\u2218, at three time steps is shown in <Ref>. The phase-field is almost zero when the peak strength is reached, <Ref>(a). In fact, due to the isotropic material model and homogeneous stress conditions of the biaxial test, two equally like fracture paths nucleate. This is consistent with the Mohr-Coulomb model. Nevertheless, only of the trajectories evolves and result in the final fracture pattern during the sudden decrease in the peak strength, <Ref>(b). Later, the phase-field variable increases its value along the fracture path up to the residual peak strength is reached, <Ref>(c).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe simulate nine cases with several combinations of p_c, \u03d5, and \u03d5_r values. \nWe also compute the peak and residual strengths applying mechanical equilibrium prior and after the fracture propagation. Given the fracture path, the mechanical equilibrium is illustrated in <Ref>. The total vertical force applied on the top boundary is F_V, the total horizontal force on the left lateral boundary is F_H, and the tangential and normal forces on the fracture path are T and N respectively. We suppose the nucleation and fracture propagation is instantaneous and the fracture path is a straight line. the angle between the fracture path and the vertical axis is\u00a0\u03b8. Then, at the onset of the fracture propagation, the tangential force on the fracture is:\n\n    T=L/sin\u03b8c+Ntan\u03d5,\n\nand once the fracture is fully developed, the tangential force on the fracture is:\n\n    T=Ntan\u03d5_r.\n\n\n\nThe mechanical equilibrium in the vertical direction is given by:\n\n    V-T cos\u03b8 -N sin\u03b8=0,\n\nand in the horizontal direction:\n\n    H+T sin\u03b8 -N cos\u03b8=0,\n\nwhere H is:\n\n    H=p_c L/tan\u03b8.\n\n\n\nSolving V from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), substituting V in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and operating, the vertical force at the onset of the fracture propagation V_p \u2013peak strength\u2013 is:\n\n    V_p=1/cos\u03b8 -sin\u03b8tan\u03d5(  L \u00b7 c/sin\u03b8 +p_c  L/tan\u03b8( cos\u03b8 tan \u03d5 + sin\u03b8) ),\n\nand the vertical force once the fracture is fully propagated V_r \u2013residual strength\u2013 is:\n\n    V_r=1/cos\u03b8 -sin\u03b8tan\u03d5_r( p_c  L/tan\u03b8( cos\u03b8 tan \u03d5_r + sin\u03b8) ).\n\n\nWe compute V_p and V_r for the nine simulated cases. The results are listed in Table\u00a0<ref>. The agreement between both models is remarkable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Slope failure analysis\n\n\n\n\nAs the last example, we consider the problem of slope failure analysis reported in <cit.>. Consider the soil slope shown in <Ref>. The domain is 20 m wide and 10 m tall, with a slope 1:1 on the left side. A 4 m wide rigid footing is placed on the crest of the slope. \nThe slope is first subjected to a body force b=20\u00a0kN/m^3, and then these body-force stresses are used as the initial state for the footing loading step. \nDisplacement at the bottom edge is fixed in both directions, while for the right edge, only horizontal displacement is fixed. \nAs the main loading step, a displacement U_y=0.3\u00a0m is prescribed in the middle of a rigid foundation, which simulates the effect of a building imposing a stress on the slope. \n\nThe elastic parameters of the soil include E=10\u00a0MPa and \u03bd = 0.4. The initial friction angle and cohesion are \u03d5 = 16.7^\u2218 and c=40\u00a0kPa, with \u03d5_r=10^\u2218 and c_r = 0\u00a0kPa as their respective residual values. The phase-field length scale parameter is set to l = 200\u00a0mm, and the domain is discretized using a free triangular mesh with mesh-size 20\u00a0mm. The resulting mesh roughly has 1M triangles and 500K vertices. The computational time takes about 12 hours in our desktop machine with i9-10900 processor with 10 cores and 20 threads.\n\n\nDue to the relatively high cohesion and low friction angle, the shear-band formation for this problem is particularly interesting. If we plot the evolution of the Mohr-Coulomb\u2019s failure envelope right before the onset of fractures, as shown in <Ref>-(a), we observe that the failure should onset from both ends of the footing. This fact has also been reported by <cit.>, however, due to the pre-specification of only one orientation angle (\u03b8), the crack formation from the left side was not captured by <cit.>. \nTherefore, to perform a comparison, we consider two cases:\n\n    \n  I. Shear band formation only from the right corner of the footing by suppressing the phase field variable to zero (d=0) in the gray region (see <Ref>).\n    \n  II. Free shear-band formation, which results in two patterns from each side followed by coalesces. \nAdditionally, we consider two critical fracture energies of G_c = 10 kJ/m^2 and G_c = 5 kJ/m^2. The final fracture patterns of these two cases are shown in <Ref>. \n\n\n\n\nThe evolution of phase-field variable for case I, with G_c = 5 kJ/m^2, are plotted for different loading steps in <Ref>. The force-displacement response is plotted in <Ref>-(b). \nAs the reader can find, the proposed formulation captures the peak and residual loads as well as the crack patterns accurately, and the results are consistent with those reported by . The failure surface evaluated using phase-field method and the peak-load is well-aligned with potential failure surfaces and critical load F=0.8MN/m resulting from  limit-equilibrium analysis of the slope using the GeoStudio software (see <Ref>-b-d).\n\nLastly, we run a new set of simulations for case II. The results are plotted in <Ref>. As we find, here the model captures first a shear band formation from the left corner of the footing. This is in fact expected because of the stress-free surface of the slope creates a more critical failure condition on the left corner. The propagation of the mode, however, stops because it is directing to Mohr-Coulomb stable regions of the domain. Later, the main failure mode initiates and propagates from the right corner, and collides with the first mode somewhere underneath the footing, which is also consistent with the results of the limit state theories. A final branch is then generated and causes the ultimate failure of the slope. The pick stress, however, does not seem to be very different from those of Case I, as plotted in <Ref>-(b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\n\nWe presented a phase-field model of shear fractures using deviatoric stress decomposition (DSD). We validated the model by solving reference problems of shear fractures in geotechnical engineering. Our model has excellent performance. \n\nThe main advantages of our phase-field approach are: (1) the model does not require re-meshing, (2) nucleation, propagation, and fracture path are automatically computed without the need to track fractures or pre-specify orientations, and (3) fracture joining and branching do not need additional algorithms. \n\n\nFor an isotropic Mohr-Coulomb material under homogeneous loading, it has been shown that there are two conjugate surfaces having the same likelihood for shear band formation. In fact, our model captures this for the biaxial compression problem without any intervention.\n\nThis is the same for the slope stability problem, where our model was able to capture crack initiation from both corners of the foundation.\nWhile accurate in peak and residual force calculations, \n\nwe found that the CSD model of shear fractures is more accurate in capturing such a transition. \n\nThe study was limited to modeling two-dimensional problems of compressive fracture. However, the proposed formulation is not limited to any dimensions. Therefore, we plan to explore three-dimensional models as a follow-up study. Additionally, pore-fluid consideration is critically important for modeling failure in geomaterials. This is also an area that will be considered next. Additional paths include incorporating rate-and-state friction models that are best suited for modeling geologic systems, and thermal coupling that is important for modeling geothermal systems. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CRACK DRIVING FORCE FOR DEVIATORIC STRESS DECOMPOSITION\n\n\nReminding that q\u0302, q\u0303_p, q\u0303_r denote the bulk and fractured deviatoric stresses at peak and residual stages, respectively, and q\u0302 = 3\u03bc\u03b5_q, with \u03b5_q and the deviatoric strain, the crack driving force during a plastic dissipation process as a result of frictional sliding can be expressed as \n\n    H_slip    = \u222b_\u03b5_\u03b3^p^\u03b5_\u03b3 (q\u0302 - q\u0303_r) d\u03b5_\u03b3\n        = \u222b_\u03b5_\u03b3^p^\u03b5_\u03b3 (3\u03bc\u03b5_q - q\u0303_r) d\u03b5_\u03b3\n        = 1/6\u03bc(q\u0302^2 - q\u0303_p^2) - q\u0303_r/3\u03bc(q\u0302- q\u0303_p ) \n        = 1/6\u03bc{(q\u0302 - q\u0303_r)^2 - (q\u0303_p - q\u0303_r)^2 }.\n\nSince q = g(d)q\u0302 + (1-g(d))q\u0303_r, we will have,\n\n    H_slip    = 1/6\u03bc{(q - q\u0303_r/g(d))^2 - (q\u0303_p - q\u0303_r)^2 }.\n\nWe observe that the relations are quite similar to those reported by  using shear stress split, except that shear stresses and strains are replaced now with deviatoric ones and therefore division by 3\u03bc instead of \u03bc. \n\nNoting that total driving energy is expressed as H = H_t + H_slip, re-arranging <ref>, we can write\n\n    H = {H_t - 1/6\u03bc(q\u0303_p - q\u0303_r)^2} + 1/6\u03bc(q - q\u0303_r/g(d))^2.\n\nNow, one can substitute this relation into the phase field PDE <ref>, and with 1D simplifications, integrate the phase field relation, as detailed in <cit.>, to arrive at approximate relations for the evolution of deviatoric stress q as a function damage. Again, since the phase field PDE <ref> and driving force <ref> are very similar to those in <cit.>, all the derivations hold identical and true for the deviatoric stress decomposition. Finally, by imposing length-scale independency to the deviatoric stress evolution, one obtains that \n\n    H_t = 1/6\u03bc(q\u0303_p - q\u0303_r)^2.\n\nThis completes the derivation of crack driving force relations introduced in <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\n\n\nAll data, models, or code generated or used during the study will be made available online at https://github.com/ehsanhaghighat/PhaseField-DSDhttps://github.com/ehsanhaghighat/PhaseField-DSD upon publication.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research Project has been funded by the Comunidad de Madrid through the call Research Grants for Young Investigators from Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid under grant APOYO-JOVENES-21-6YB2DD-127-N6ZTY3, RSIEIH project, research program V PRICIT.
