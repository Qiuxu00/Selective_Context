The wave functions of atoms in the superfluid phase are delocalised over the whole lattice and overlap. In the Mott phase, the wave functions are localised around lattice sites. The GHZ state is being generated in the superfluid phase and stored in the Mott insulator phase. It is achieved by a linear change of the potential depth in an optical lattice filled with atoms of two species. The numerical method used to describe the system is based on the exact diagonalisation of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. A quantum correlator indicating the level of multi-mode entanglement is introduced. Finally, it is shown that the value of the correlator indicates generation of the GHZ state.

The considered system and protocol can be realised experimentally with nowadays techniques <cit.>. The method can be exploit for experimental generation of entanglement in the many-body system. It can also be used as a framework for theoretical studies of multi-mode entanglement.\n\t\n\tThe main concept underlying this work is entanglement <cit.>. Discussion of this phenomenon starts with the groundbreaking paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen from 1935 <cit.>. In that paper, the authors showed that in quantum theory a measurement conducted on one particle can give a certain information about the result of some measurement on another particle. They proven that this is independent of the interval separating the particles, what implies a non-local correlation between observables. In the same year, another paper was published by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger where entanglement has been discussed as a general phenomenon of quantum theory <cit.>.\n\n\tThe phenomenon of entanglement can be understood in the following way: A group of quantum-mechanical objects are in entangled state if one can not describe behaviour of each of them separately, but rather has to consider the state of the whole system in order not to lose any information about the behaviour of its parts. Entanglement has already been proven to be of great importance in many areas like quantum information <cit.>, quantum cryptography <cit.> and other branches of quantum theory. Another important field that exploits entanglement is quantum metrology, the idea of which is to perform precise measurements of physical quantities, for example in quantum interferometry <cit.>.\n\tEntanglement is a distinctive feature of quantum theory. It gives plenty of possibilities to experimentally test the advantage of quantum theory over the classical theory in describing physical phenomena <cit.>.\n\tThe entangled states can be produced using many techniques: in quantum optics (with photons <cit.>), solid state physics <cit.> or cold matter physics (using ions or neutral gases of ultracold atoms <cit.>).\n\n\tOne of the most extensively exploited entangled states is the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, which is the maximally entangled state. It was first proposed in <cit.> to test the fundamental issue of non-locality in quantum theory. For a system of M qubits (each qubit from orthonormal basis {|0\u27e9, |1\u27e9}) the GHZ state is defined as\n\t\n    |GHZ\u27e9 := |0\u27e9^\u2297 M+|1\u27e9^\u2297 M/\u221a(2).\n\n\tThis state has been found useful in quantum information theory <cit.>. As a superposition of two macroscopic states it is fragile to decoherence, and thus, difficult to be produced in laboratory, in particular for a large number of qubits. The first successful attempt to produce it was made in 1999 with use of three photons <cit.>. The state-of-the-art experiments achieve a GHZ state composed of up to 27 qubits <cit.>. This work, following <cit.>, proposes a protocol allowing to create the GHZ state using an arbitrary number of bosonic atoms in optical lattice.\n\t\n\tThis work focuses on a system composed of bosonic atoms loaded into an optical lattice potential. The ultracold regime is considered so that the Bose-Hubbard model can be used as an approximation giving sufficient description of the system <cit.>. The system can be observed in two distinct thermodynamic phases <cit.> \u2013 the superfluid phase characterised by the presence of Bose-Einstein condensate <cit.> and the Mott insulator phase characterised by the fact that all particles are well-localised at the lattice sites.\n\t\n\tThis thesis is motivated by the results of two papers <cit.>. In <cit.> the authors propose a protocol for generation and storage spin-squeezed states in the Mott phase. Additionally, they show that the protocol allows one to generate the GHZ state and store it in the optical lattice. The idea of this thesis is to characterise and prove that indeed the highly entangled state can be generated and stored in the Mott insulator phase using the above method. To quantify the level of entanglement in this thesis a generalised notion of the correlator defined in <cit.> is used. The generalisation bases on the theorems [the:Theorem1] and [the:MaxC], which are proved in appendices. The value of the correlator is bounded from above for separable (non-entangled) states. Breaking the bound proves that the state is entangled <cit.>.\n\t\n\tIt was also shown that the correlator quantifies the level of entanglement in the system <cit.>.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nCHAPTER: DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM\n \n\t\n\t\n\n\tIn quantum statistical physics, there are two classes of particles \u2013 fermions and bosons. Fermionic particles ([fermions]) are characterised by the property that any wave function describing a set of them is anti-symmetric due to exchange of the particles. This leads to an important fact that only one fermion can occupy a state described by specific quantum number. The other type of particles \u2013 [bosons] \u2013 is characterised by the symmetry of the wave function due to exchange of particles. This gives a possibility of arbitrary many bosons taking the exact same quantum state.\n\n\tThis work examines bosonic particles at ultra-low temperatures of the order of hundreds of nanokelvins. A gas composed of bosons at such low temperatures exhibits a phase transition to the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate. This phenomenon was theoretically predicted in 1924 by Satyendra Nath Bose <cit.> and Albert Einstein <cit.>. It was experimentally realised for the first time in 1995 by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman et al. <cit.> and, independently, in the same year by Wolfgang Ketterle et al. <cit.>. In 2001, the experiments were honoured with the Nobel prize in physics <cit.>.\n\t\n\tIn a bosonic gas below the critical temperature T_c (usually T_c \u223c 100\u00a0nK for atoms) a macroscopic number of particles tends to occupy the lowest energy state. The macroscopic quantum state composed of the bosons occupying the ground state is called the [Bose-Einstein condensate] (BEC). The amount of BEC in a gas can be expressed by a notion of the [condensate fraction]\n\t\n    f_c := \u27e8n_0|\u27e9/N,\n\n\twhere \u27e8n_0|$\u27e9 is the average number of particles in the lowest energy state, andNis the total number of particles in the gas. A gas withf_c\u22481is called pure condensate.\n\n\tAll the particles forming BEC are indistinguishable. It allows to apply a quantum operation to a large set of particles simultaneously. For this reason, using cold gases, one has more potentiality in manipulating many-body quantum systems than using solid states. Thanks to those properties, a whole branch of research projects exploiting BEC has emerged. They include investigations of interference of two condensates <cit.>, applications of BEC in quantum metrology <cit.>, producing solitons <cit.>, Feshbach resonances <cit.> and squeezed or entangled states <cit.> in Bose-Einstein condensate. Experiments on the generation of BEC are being conducted all over the world including KL FAMO laboratory in Toru\u0144 <cit.> and even in space <cit.>.\n\n\tThis research investigates an ultracold gas of bosonic atoms, which may exhibit a Bose-Einstein condensation. It will be referred to when discussing the condensate fraction in the further sections. It is, however, worth mentioning that BEC is not the key aspect of the study. This work examines bosonic atoms loaded into an optical lattice, which might have properties of BEC in some regime of parameters what will be discussed in Section\u00a0[sec:phaseDiagram]. In other ranges of parameters, the system is in the Mott insulator phase. \n\tIn the end it is worth noting that this study investigates a finite number of particles; thus, referring to thermodynamic phenomena such as BEC cannot be considered in a strict sense.\n\n\n\t\n\n\u00a7 OPTICAL LATTICE\n\n\n\tThe protocol proposed in this thesis relies on optical lattice \u2013 a device, which, using lasers, creates an effective periodic trapping potential for ultracold atoms.\n\n\tAn optical lattice is made of counter-propagating laser beams. To keep the atoms in the optical lattice potential, they are first cooled down to ultra-low temperatures of the order of hundreds of nanokelvins using various methods of cooling and trapping <cit.>. The whole setup is closed in a vacuum chamber to isolate the system from the environment to avoid undesirable effects, e.g. scattering with other particles. The atomic gas is also very dilute to prevent many-body scattering events. Those events would lead to emergence of molecules, which would not be trapped by the optical lattice leading to vaporisation of the atoms in a short time.\n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Potential of the lattice\n\n\n    \tThe counter-propagating laser beams are tuned in such a way that the electro-magnetic field forms a standing wave. Following <cit.>, in the one-dimensional case, the electric field \ud835\udc04 of the standing wave can be written as\n    \t\n    \ud835\udc04(x,t) = \u00ea_\u22a5\u1ebc(x) sin(\u03c9_L t) := \u00ea_\u22a5 E_0 sin(k_L x)sin(\u03c9_L t),\n\n    \twith \u00ea_\u22a5\u2013 the unit [polarisation vector] perpendicular to the x-axis, \u1ebc(x)\u2013[field amplitude] in each point x of space, E_0\u2013 amplitude of the electro-magnetic field, k_L=2 \u03c0\u03bb_L[wavevector] of the monochromatic light of [wavelength] \u03bb_L, \u03c9_L=2 \u03c0 c\u03bb_L\u2013[angular frequency] of the light and t\u2013 time.\n    \t\n    \tIf a neutral atom is surrounded by such a field it induces an atomic dipole moment \ud835\udc29:\n    \t\n    \ud835\udc29(x,t) = \u00ea_\u22a5\u03b1\u1ebc(x) sin(\u03c9_L t),\n\n    \twhere \u03b1 being called [complex polarisability] is dependent on the frequency \u03c9_L of the light <cit.>. Interaction of the atom with the field creates [dipole potential] V:\n    \t\n    V(x) = - 1/2\u222b_0^2 \u03c0/\u03c9_L\ud835\udc29\u00b7\ud835\udc04\u00a0dt = - Re(\u03b1) | \u1ebc|^2 =\n\n    = - Re(\u03b1) E_0^2 sin^2(2 \u03c0/\u03bb_L x),\n\n    \twhere integral denotes time-averaging over one period of the optical wave <cit.>.\n    \t\n    \tIt is apparent that two counter-propagating laser beams of wavelength \u03bb_L can create a potential with [spatial period] d:=\u03bb_L2 for a neutral atom. This periodic structure of the potential with ability to trap atoms is called [optical lattice]. The following Figure\u00a0<ref> presents a sketch of the one-dimensional optical lattice. The red arrows illustrate laser beams while the sinusoidal line the potential created by the standing electro-magnetic wave.\n    \t\n\n\tWhat is highly useful is that one can precisely control parameters of the lattice such as geometry of the lattice and its depth during the experiment by changing the frequency of the laser beams, their intensity and the angle between them. Using two counter-propagating laser beams one gets one-dimensional periodic structure of the lattice potential. One can create two- or three-dimensional structures with four or six laser beams (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). The elementary cell of the lattice is cubic when the laser beams are perpendicular. A system of triclinic symmetry can be also created when changing the angles between the laser beams. In the whole lattice there are thousands of atoms, usually few per one site. However, one can very precisely control the number of atoms in each site. The opportunity of changing so many parameters makes optical lattices a basic element of many experiments like the most precise device available to humans \u2013 the optical lattice clock <cit.>.\n\n    \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Parameters of the lattice\n\n\n\tThis work models bosonic atoms loaded into the one-dimensional optical lattice potential\n\t\n    V(x) = - Re(\u03b1) E_0^2 sin^2 ( 2 \u03c0/\u03bb_L x ) =: V_0 sin^2 (  k_L \u00a0x ),\n\n\twhereV_0:=- Re(\u03b1) E_0^2is called [lattice depth] or [lattice height],k_L = 2\u03c0/\u03bb_Lis the wave number of trapping light, andd=\u03bb_L/2is the spatial [period of the lattice]. For typically used lasers,\u03bb_L\u2248800nm.\n\n\tUsingk_Land massmof a single atom, one can introduce a natural energy scale,\n\t\n    E_R := k_L^2 \u0127^2/2 m =  h^2/2 m \u03bb_L^2.\n\n\tIn further sections the [recoil energy]E_Ris used as the energy unit. This value is typically close to2.4 \u00b710^-30 J.\n\n\tIn the numerical calculations, dimensionless variables like\n\t\n    \u1e7c_0 := V_0/E_R\n\n\tare used. The value of\u1e7c_0in this study is usually in the range\u1e7c_0\u2208[3, 45].\n\n\tThis thesis examinesN=6atoms onM=6lattice sites, it also assumes periodic boundary conditions. The system can be thus modelled using the Bose-Hubbard model <cit.> introduced in the next paragraph.\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\u00a7 THE BOSE-HUBBARD MODEL\n\n\t\n\tThe dynamics of the optical lattice filled with bosons can be approximately described by the so-called [Bose-Hubbard model] <cit.>. The approximation assumes that the particles are localised near the lattice sites, the tunnelling of the particles between the lattice sites can only occur between the nearest-neighbour sites and that the only possible states are those in the lowest energy band.\n\n\tIn this work an ultracold gas composed of a few bosonic atoms with repulsive interaction in two internal statesAandB, loaded into a three-dimensional potential of an optical lattice is considered. It is assumed that tunnelling is only possible along thexdirection while transversely the atoms are described by a localised wave function that can be approximated by a Gaussian function with a characteristic lengthL_\u22a5. The optical lattice potential in thex-direction isV(x)(<ref>). In the absence of the lattice, the system is homogeneous and the atoms are confined in a [flat-bottom potential] <cit.>. After reduction of the perpendicular directions, the effective one-dimensional system Hamiltonian reads\n\t\n    \u210b\u0302   =   \u2211_\u03c3=A,B\u222b dx (\n    \t\t\u03a8\u0302_\u03c3^\u2020(x) \u0125\u03a8\u0302_\u03c3(x) + \n    \t\tg_\u03c3\u03c3/2\u03a8\u0302_\u03c3^2\u2020(x) \u03a8\u0302_\u03c3^2(x) ) \n       +    g_AB\u222b dx  \u03a8\u0302_A^\u2020(x)\u03a8\u0302_B^\u2020(x)\u03a8\u0302_B(x)\u03a8\u0302_A(x)\n\n\twith the single-particle Hamiltonian\n\t\n    \u0125 = -\u0127^2/2 md^2/dx^2 + V(x)\n\n\tand\u03a8\u0302_\u03c3(x)\u2013 the field operator annihilating a boson in state\u03c3at positionx. The interaction coefficientsg_\u03c3\u03c3'=g^3D_\u03c3\u03c3'/(2 \u03c0L_\u22a5^2)are determined by the transverse confinement lengthL_\u22a5and by the coupling constants in three dimensionsg^3D_\u03c3\u03c3'=4\u03c0\u0127^2 a_\u03c3\u03c3'/m, wherea_\u03c3\u03c3'is thes-wave scattering length for one atom in the state\u03c3and the other one in\u03c3',mis the atomic mass and\u0127is the Planck constant. This study assumes repulsive interaction between atoms in the two states, withA \u2194Bsymmetry leading tog_AA = g_BB, and an adjustable inter-species couplingg_AB, restricting to the phase-mixing regime:g_AB<g_AA<cit.>.\n\n\tThe motion of a particle in a periodic potential formed by an optical lattice can be conveniently described by the band theory, and the system Hamiltonian (<ref>) can be considered in the basis of Bloch functions\u03c8_l,q(x, t)<cit.>. These are eigenfunctions of the single-particle Hamiltonian (<ref>) and posses required translational properties. The Bloch functions can be constructed numerically in the plane wave basis as described in <cit.>. As the next step, the Hamiltonian is rewritten in the basis of Wannier functionsw(x-x_i,t)localised around lattice sites, wherex_idenotes position of theisite, in the lowest energy band. The Wannier functions can be conveniently constructed from the Bloch states\u03c8_l=1,q(x,t)in the following way\n\t\t\n    w(x-x_i,t) = ( d/2 \u03c0) ^1/2\u222b_q \u2208 1BZ dq   e^-i q x_i \u03c8_l=1,q(x,t).\n\n\t\tSummation in Equation\u00a0(<ref>) extends over wave vectors belonging to the 1st[Brillouin zone] (1BZ),-k_L< q \u2264k_L. The two-component Hamiltonian is then\n\t\t\n    \u210b\u0302   = -\u2211_i, j J(i-j) (\u00e2_i^\u2020\u00e2_j + b\u0302_i^\u2020b\u0302_j) \n    \n    \t\t+    1/2\u2211_i,j,k,l U^AA_i,j,k,l\u00e2^\u2020_i \u00e2^\u2020_j \u00e2_k \u00e2_l \n    \t\t+ 1/2\u2211_i,j,k,l U^BB_i,j,k,lb\u0302^\u2020_i b\u0302^\u2020_j b\u0302_k b\u0302_l \n    \n    \t\t+    \u2211_i,j,k,l U^AB_i,j,k,l\u00e2^\u2020_i b\u0302^\u2020_j \u00e2_k b\u0302_l ,\n\n\t\twhere\u00e2_i^\u2020(orb\u0302_i^\u2020) creates a particle in the single-particle Wannier statew(x-x_i,t)of the lowest energy band (l=1) localised on theisite, in the internal stateA(orBrespectively). The commutation relations between those operators are presented in the equations (<ref>).\n\t\t\n\t\tThe Bose-Hubbard model considers only states in the lowest energy band, which is justified as long as the excitation energies to the higher bands are much larger than the energies involved in the system dynamics. In general, if the lattice heightV_0(t)is being varied in time, the Wannier functions, and hence the hopping and interaction parameters depend on time\n\t\t\n    J(i-j)     = - d/2\u03c0\u222b_q \u2208 1BZ d q   E_q e^-i (i-j)d q \n    \n    \t\t\tU^\u03c3\u03c3'_i,j,k,l    = g_\u03c3\u03c3'\u222b dx  w(i)w(j)w(k)w(l),\n\n\t\twherew(i)=w(x-x_i). \n\t\tDue to the orthonormality of the Wannier functions, the tunnelling termsJ(i-j)are independent on the dimension while the interaction parameters are not, as the Wannier function factorises in the respective spatial dimensions.\n\t\n\tIn the [tight-binding] limit when the lattice height is larger than the recoil energyE_R=\u0127^2k_L^2/(2m)and the Wannier functions are well-localised around each lattice site, the tunnelling and interaction terms fall off rapidly with the distance|x_i - x_j|. By keeping  only the leading terms in (<ref>), one obtains the Bose-Hubbard model\n\t\n    \u210b\u0302_BH = \u210b\u0302_hopp + \u210b\u0302_int,\n\n\twhere\n\t\n    \u210b\u0302_hopp   = - J\u2211_< i,j> =1^M\u00e2_i^\u2020\u00e2_j  - J\u2211_< i,j> =1^Mb\u0302_i^\u2020b\u0302_j, \n    \u210b\u0302_int   = U_AA/2\u2211_i=1^Mn\u0302^A_i (n\u0302^A_i - 1) + U_BB/2\u2211_i=1^Mn\u0302^B_i (n\u0302^B_i - 1) + U_AB\u2211_i=1^Mn\u0302^A_i n\u0302^B_i.\nIn the above expressions J:=J(1), U_\u03c3\u03c3':=U^\u03c3\u03c3'_0,0,0,0 and n\u0302^A_i:=\u00e2_i^\u2020\u00e2_i, n\u0302^B_i:=b\u0302_i^\u2020b\u0302_i.

In this way, any operation (like the calculation of an average) can be translated to a numerical multiplication or addition of matrices and vectors.\n\n\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Single-site operators\n\n\t\n\n\tIn this study, quantum states describing multiple lattice sites are examined. Sometimes, the operators used in the work act on the whole state, however, other times they act only on a single lattice. It is thus convenient to introduce the notation below. An operator acting on a single site state is marked by a superscript with parentheses. For instance, \ud835\udcaa\u0302^(j) operator acts on a state describing j lattice site only. For any operator \ud835\udcaa\u0302^(j) acting on a state describing a single lattice site, one can define an operator \ud835\udcaa\u0302_j acting on a state describing the whole lattice such that\n\t\n    \ud835\udcaa\u0302_j := ^(1)\u2297\u22ef\u2297^(j-1)\u2297\ud835\udcaa\u0302^(j)\u2297^(j+1)\u2297\u22ef\u2297^(M)\n\n\tand ^(k) are identity operators acting on state describing k\u00a0 lattice site.\n\tOne can note here that the mathematical form of \ud835\udcaa\u0302^(j) operators with different values of j is the same. However, by changing the value of j in the superscript of the operator \ud835\udcaa\u0302^(j) one changes the physical interpretation of the operator, because it acts on another lattice site. On the other hand, changing the lower index of \ud835\udcaa\u0302_j, changes also the mathematical form of this operator.\n\n\tThis thesis uses also operators of form:\n\t\n    \ud835\udcaa\u0302 = \u2211_j=1^M \ud835\udcaa\u0302_j,\n\n\tlike the spin operators defined in Subsection\u00a0[sec:SpinOperators] or:\n\t\n    \ud835\udcaa\u0302 = \u2297_j=1^M \ud835\udcaa\u0302^(j),\n\n\tlike the \u015c_rot operator defined in Section\u00a0[sec:CorrelatorChoice].

One can then investigate its thermodynamic properties. As this thesis deals with systems with finite number of particles, the thermodynamic limit cannot be achieved. However, for simplicity, the terminology from statistical physics is used, because in finite systems there appear analogous phenomena as in thermodynamics of infinite systems.\n\n    The following subsections describe two interesting regimes of the phase diagram of the ground states of the Hamiltonian. Those are Mott insulator regime and superfluid regime.\n\n\tIn order to calculate the phase diagram at zero temperature, a numerical program to compute the ground states of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian for different numbers of particles per site\u03bd:=N/MandU/Jratios was prepared. ForM = 8sites in the lattice andU_AA = U_BB,U_AB = 0.95   U_AA, the variance of particle numbers and condensate fraction were calculated for different values ofJand different total numbers of atomsN. The results are presented in subsections [subs:MI] and [subs:SF].\n\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Mott insulator phase\n\n\t\t\n\t\tIn the regime, where J \u226a U_\u03c3\u03c3', the hopping term becomes negligible. The atoms become localised as probability of hopping between different lattice sites becomes very small.\n\n\t\tThe interaction between atoms is repulsive (U_\u03c3\u03c3'\u2265 0) and the system is translationally invariant; thus, the system tends to occupy the states with homogeneous distribution of atoms over the lattice. The ground states of the system are realised with exactly one atom per site for N=M.\n\n\t\tThis regime is called the [Mott insulator phase] <cit.>. It is interesting as in this regime, the interaction between atoms at neighbouring sites is suppressed and many-body properties such as entanglement can be \u201cfrozen\u201d.\n\n\t\tTo verify if the system is in the Mott insulator phase, the variance of the population of particles in each site is used:\n\t\t\n    _i := \u0394^2 (n\u0302^A_i + n\u0302^B_i) \u2261\u27e8(n\u0302^A_i + n\u0302^B_i)^2|-\u27e9\u27e8n\u0302^A_i + n\u0302^B_i|^\u27e92.\n\n\t\tIt tends to zero for each site i in the Mott regime.

In this regime the system is [superfluid] \u2013 the wave functions of atoms are spatially delocalised and atoms can easily interact with each other <cit.>.\n\n\t\tThis study employs the notion of [superfluid fraction] to indicate the existence of the superfluid phase. In the case of this work, the superfluid fraction is equal to [condensate fraction] <cit.>\n    f_c := 1/N M\u2211_i=1^M \u2211_j=1^M \u2211_\u03b1=a,b\u27e8\u03b1\u0302_i^\u2020\u03b1\u0302_j|,\u27e9\n\n\t\twhich measures the amount of atoms in the zero quasi-momentum mode.\n\t\t\n\t\tFigure <ref> shows interpolated values of f_c\u2013 a measure of condensate fraction and superfluid fraction as well \u2013 depending on J/U_\u03c3\u03c3 and N/M.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\u00a7 ENTANGLEMENT\n\n    \n\n\tEntanglement is one of the key features of quantum systems. As being unique for quantum mechanics, it witnesses non-classicality of physical systems <cit.>. It can also be used as a resource in quantum information protocols such as dense coding or quantum teleportation <cit.>. \n\n\tIn the linear-algebraic terms of quantum theory, entanglement is a property of a multipartite system, which is described by non-separable density operator. To explain what is non-separability, first definition of [separability] has to be introduced.

Then it is shown that the model takes the form of the one-axis twisting model and the consequences of this fact are discussed.\n    \n    The Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian (<ref>) can be written in the momentum representation as follows (see, e.g. <cit.>):\n    \n    \u210b\u0302_BH = \u2211_q \u03f5_q \u00e3\u0302_q^\u2020\u00e3\u0302_q + \u2211_q \u03f5_q b\u0302\u0303\u0302_q^\u2020b\u0302\u0303\u0302_q +\n\n    + \u2211_q_1, q_2, k[ U_AA/2M\u00e3\u0302_q_1-k^\u2020\u00e3\u0302_q_2+k^\u2020\u00e3\u0302_q_1\u00e3\u0302_q_2 + U_BB/2Mb\u0302\u0303\u0302_q_1-k^\u2020b\u0302\u0303\u0302_q_2+k^\u2020b\u0302\u0303\u0302_q_1b\u0302\u0303\u0302_q_2] +\n\n    + \u2211_q_1, q_2, kU_AB/M\u00e3\u0302_q_1-k^\u2020b\u0302\u0303\u0302_q_2+k^\u2020\u00e3\u0302_q_1b\u0302\u0303\u0302_q_2,\n\n    where\u00e3\u0302_q^\u2020andb\u0302\u0303\u0302_q^\u2020are creation operators of a particle with quasi-momentumqin stateAandBrespectively:\n    \n    \u00e2_i^\u2020   = 1/\u221a(M)\u2211_q e^-  q x_i\u00e3\u0302_q^\u2020, \n    b\u0302_i^\u2020   = 1/\u221a(M)\u2211_q e^-  q x_ib\u0302\u0303\u0302_q^\u2020\n\n    withx_ibeing the position ofilattice site and\n    \n    \u03f5_q = - 2 J cosq d,\n\n    wheredis the spatial distance separating lattice sites.\n\t\t\n\tIn the superfluid phase, when condensate fraction (<ref>) is close to one, most of the atoms tend to occupy the zero momentum mode. In this regime, the following part of the Hamiltonian (<ref>) can be considered, to effectively describe the system:\n\t\n    \u210b\u0302_BH, q=0 = \u03f5_0\u00d1\u0302_0^A + \u03f5_0\u00d1\u0302_0^B + U_AA/2M\u00d1\u0302_0^A^2 + U_BB/2M\u00d1\u0302_0^B^2 + U_AB/M\u00d1\u0302_0^A\u00d1\u0302_0^B,\n\n    where\u00d1\u0302_0^A, \u00d1\u0302_0^Bare numbers of atoms in the zero momentum mode defined as\n    \n    \u00d1\u0302_0^A   := \u00e3\u0302_0^\u2020\u00e3\u0302_0, \n    \u00d1\u0302_0^B   := b\u0302\u0303\u0302_0^\u2020b\u0302\u0303\u0302_0.\n\n    \n    Assuming that the system is in the superfluid phase with condensed fractionf_c\u22481, one might expect that\u27e8\u00d1\u0302_0^A+\u00d1\u0302_0^B|\u2248\u27e9Nand therefore the Bose-Hubbard model for q=0 takes the form:\n    \n    \u210b\u0302_BH, q=0 = U_AA+U_BB - 2 U_AB/2M\u015c_z_0^2 + U_AA-U_BB/2M\u015c_z_0\u00d1\u0302_0 +\n\n    + U_AA+U_BB+4 U_AB/8M\u00d1\u0302_0^2 + \u03f5_0\u00d1\u0302_0,\n\n    where\n    \n    \u015c_z_0   := 1/2( \u00d1\u0302_0^A - \u00d1\u0302_0^B),\n    \u00d1\u0302_0   := \u00d1\u0302_0^A + \u00d1\u0302_0^B.\n\n    The first term in (<ref>) has the form of the famous one-axis twisting model <cit.>. Here thezcomponent of the collective vector refers to the zero-momentum mode only.\n\n    It is already widely understood that the one-axis twisting model, from the initial spin-coherent state, generates squeezed and entangled states, including Schr\u00f6dinger cat state <cit.>. The latter one is nothing else as the rotated GHZ state that this thesis focuses on. Taking this into account, one can expect that the Bose-Hubbard model generates squeezed and entangled states in the superfluid regime. Therefore, the idea of this work, as explained in Subsection\u00a0[sec:Protocol], is to generate an entangled state in the superfluid phase and then shift the system to the Mott insulator phase by rising the lattice height.\n    \n\n\t\n\n\u00a7 THE INITIAL STATE\n\n\n\tIt is already well-recognised that squeezing and entanglement in an optical lattice can be generated from the initial spin-coherent state <cit.>. The spin-coherent state can be conveniently prepared in numerical simulation using the following procedure.\n\n\tOne starts the simulation from the ground state|GS^A\u27e9of the Hamiltonian (<ref>), with additional condition of all particles being in theAstate. The ground state is calculated numerically. An example forN=M=2is given in the Appendix\u00a0[app:Neq2].\tThe|GS^A\u27e9state is then exposed to rotation around they-axis of the generalised Bloch sphere to obtain [spin-coherent state]|GS^+\u27e9:\n\t\n    |\u03a8(t=0)\u27e9 = |GS^+\u27e9 := e^-\u03c0/2\u015c_y|GS^A\u27e9,\n\n\twhere\u015c_yoperator is defined by (<ref>).\n\t\n\t\n\tThe spin-coherent state is then evolved according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\n\t\n    i\u0127\u2202/\u2202 t|\u03a8(t)\u27e9 = \u210b\u0302_BH(t) |\u03a8(t)\u27e9.\n\n\n\tIn this thesis the equation is solved numerically. The equation can be solved analytically only forN=M=2and constant Hamiltonian. The solution for theN=M=2case is presented in Appendix\u00a0[app:Neq2].\n\n\n    \n\t\n\n\u00a7 THE PROTOCOL\n\n\t\n\tThis section proposes a protocol for generating entangled states. The protocol exploits the existence of two phases in the optical lattice. It is achieved by using a model of an optical lattice filled with ultracold atoms. At the beginning, the lattice is prepared in a ground state of bosonic atoms in one internal stateA. Then a\u03c0/2-pulse is applied to create a superposition of two internal states of atoms (it is the spin-coherent state (<ref>)). The system being in superfluid phase is evolved dynamically to create entanglement. During evolution, the lattice depth is being increased to reach Mott insulator phase and eventually stop the interaction to freeze the state. The quantum correlator\ud835\udc9e_e\u20d7defined in the next section [sec:QuantumEntanglement] is used to quantify entanglement in the 6-partite system. The study finds that the appropriate choice of parameters in the protocol allows one to create maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. The protocol follows the method presented in <cit.>. This thesis presents an analysis of entanglement in the system and introduces tools similar to those presented in <cit.> to measure entanglement in a more general case.\n\t\n\t\n    < g r a p h i c s >\n(a) At the beginning, in a shallow optical lattice, ultracold bosons in an internal state A are prepared in the superfluid phase. The number of atoms is equal to the number of lattices. (b) Then a \u03c0/2-pulse is applied to put each atom in a coherent superposition of two internal states A and B. As the system is in the superfluid phase, non-linear interaction between atoms starts the generation of quantum correlations in the system. (c) Depth of the lattice is being gradually increased to perform adiabatic change of the Hamiltonian and shift the system from the superfluid to the Mott-insulator phase and freeze the created correlations. Reprinted from <cit.>.\n\t\n\nCHAPTER: METHODS\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\u00a7 STRATEGY\n\n\n\tThe research started from investigating the ground states of the Hamiltonian (<ref>) for different parameters of the lattice. It was done to get a better understanding of the phase diagram of the system and to find the numerical values of the parameters leading to Mott insulator phase and superfluid phase (Section\u00a0[sec:phaseDiagram]).\n\n\tThen a numerical program (Appendix\u00a0[app:NumericalProgram]) was prepared to calculate the ground states of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with different values of its parameters. To construct the Hamiltonian, the Fock basis (Subsection\u00a0[sec:FockBasis]) was used. The states were represented by vectors whose components correspond to the coefficients of decomposition in the basis. The operators, such as the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, were represented by matrices in the same basis. Values of condensate fraction (<ref>) and particle number variance (<ref>) for these states were calculated to specify for which range of parameters one deals with Mott or superfluid regime. The results are shown in figures <ref> and <ref>.\n\n\tFrom the phase diagram, the appropriate parameters of the system were found to create a protocol for freezing the states. The idea was to evolve the state in the superfluid regime so it would become entangled and adiabatically shift the system into Mott regime to \u201cfreeze\u201d the entanglement.\n\n\tNext, a numerical program was written to solve numerically the Schr\u00f6dinger equation using the Runge-Kutta method <cit.>. The initial state was prepared numerically according to Section\u00a0[sec:initialStatePreparation].\n\tDuring evolution the program was also calculating values of other observables such as fluctuations of particles number_i(<ref>), superfluid fractionf_c(<ref>) and correlator (<ref>).\n\tA linear increase of the lattice potential was assumed what is easily achievable in an experiment. The aim was to verify whether it is possible to generate entanglement in the lattice and store it in Mott insulator phase, and possibly to find a protocol, which gives the most entangled state. Simulations for different ramp times\u03c4were run to analyse the resulting states. To examine the entanglement in the system, Inequality (<ref>) was derived and used as a criterion for separability. The value of  was employed as a measure of entanglement.\n\n\n\t\n\n\u00a7 COMPUTER TOOLS\n\n\t\n\tTo perform numerical simulations, programming languages such as ,  and  were used. The research involved  and  libraries in  code, , ,  and  in  code and  package in the  code to ensure efficient computations. All the simulations were prepared in the framework of GNU/Linux operating system Ubuntu. To increase the computational efficiency, the fact that the Hamiltonian matrix is sparse was exploited and special techniques for operating on sparse matrices were applied. A brief description of the computer program realising the simulations is presented in the Appendix\u00a0[app:NumericalProgram].\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\nCHAPTER: RESULTS\n\n\t\n    This work presents a method of generating and storing entangled states of a few bosonic atoms in an optical lattice potential described by the Bose-Hubbard model. To prove that there is entanglement in the system, a family of correlators  was introduced in Subsection\u00a0[subs:Correlator]. The value of  is a measure of entanglement in the system as shown in Subsection\u00a0[subs:Witness]. To validate that the correlator  can be used as a witness of entanglement, another important result of this thesis \u2013 Theorem\u00a0[the:Theorem1] leading to separability bound (<ref>)\u2013 was proven.   \n\n    In the previous chapters, the Bose-Hubbard model describing one-dimensional optical lattice was introduced (Section\u00a0[sec:BoseHubbardModel]). Then it was shown that this model can be mapped into one-axis twisting model and allows producing entangled states (Section\u00a0[sec:HamiltonianIn0q]). A protocol generating entangled states, using the spin-coherent state (<ref>) as the initial state, was described in Section\u00a0[sec:Protocol]. The protocol consists of the following steps: First, the spin-coherent state|GS^+\u27e9(<ref>) is created in the lattice. The lattice is tuned so that the system remains in the superfluid regime to enable entanglement generation. Then the lattice potential height is slowly increased to adiabatically shift the system to the Mott regime where the dynamics slows down and the level of entanglement is frozen.\n\n    The following Section\u00a0[sec:Tuning] presents how to determine the parameters of the model (number of particles per site\u03bdand the lattice potential heightV_0) allowing to operate the lattice from superfluid to Mott insulator regime. The form of the states produced by the protocol is discussed in Section\u00a0[sec:InternalStructure]. For some ramp time, the resulting state (<ref>), at the end of the evolution, is the GHZ state. In Section\u00a0[sec:CorrelatorChoice] it is shown how to find a correlator proving that this state is the maximally entangled state. At the end, Section\u00a0[sec:Breaking] demonstrates that indeed the protocol produces entangled states and specifically the maximally entangled state.\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\u00a7 TUNING THE TRAP\n\n\t\n\tThe goal of this work was to create and store an entangled state. As shown in Section\u00a0[sec:HamiltonianIn0q], Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian creates entanglement in a system in the superfluid regime. On the other hand the Mott insulator phase is necessary to freeze the state. This section presents how to choose the proper values of the number of particles per site\u03bdand the lattice potential heightV_0to prepare the system in the superfluid phase and shift it to the Mott insulator phase.\n\t\n\tThe Mott insulator phase is only achievable for integer number of particles per lattice site <cit.>, as it is apparent from the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model (Figure\u00a0<ref>). This study examines a system with one particle per lattice site (N = M). It has an additional feature that in the deep Mott regime the system can be described as a spin-1/2chain <cit.>. Due to computational limitations, it was chosen to consider a system with six lattice sites (M=6).\n\n\tA simulation with linear change of potential from3 E_Rto45 E_Rin a very long time (ramp time\u03c4=10000\u00a0\u0127/E_R) was run to provide adiabatic evolution. The variance of particles' number and condensate fraction was calculated to investigate for which ranges of potential there is Mott insulator or superfluid phase.\n\t\n\t\n    < g r a p h i c s >\nA plot showing the condensate fraction f_c (<ref>) and the variance of the number of particles in the first site \u03b4_1 (<ref>) as a function of the lattice potential V_0 during adiabatic evolution of the system (V_0 changing slowly from 3 to 45 E_R).\n\t\n\tAs observed in Figure\u00a0<ref>, the condensate fractionf_cis close to one and the system is in the superfluid regime for small values of the lattice's potential (V_0 \u2272 4 E_R). In this regime, the high value of condensate fractionf_callows entanglement generation (as explained in Section\u00a0[sec:HamiltonianIn0q]). When increasingV_0to around30 E_R, the variance of number of particles in lattice site\u03b4_itends to zero (Figure\u00a0<ref>). It indicates that the system arrives at the Mott regime with exactly one atom per lattice site. The interaction between the atoms is hindered. The change of the system's parameters is then suppressed and one can expect to be able to \u201cfreeze\u201d the resulting state.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\u00a7 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE STATE\n\n\t\n\tTo investigate the protocol (Section\u00a0[sec:Protocol]), simulations of the system withN=M=6for different ramp times\u03c4were run.

The upper plot demonstrates the norm of coefficients c_N_AN_B whose values are close to 1/2^3 as expected. The lower plot shows phases of the coefficients, which are linearly changing with the value of \u03c4. The value \u03c4=19100 is marked with horizontal line. For this ramp time, one gets \u03d5_42\u22480 and \u03d5_51\u2248\u03c0/2\u2248\u03d5_33, and therefore the state is a superposition of two phase-states (<ref>)\u2013 which is the GHZ state. \n\t\n\tTo rewrite the resulting state|\u03a8\u27e9_MI,N=6the phase-state|\u03d5\u27e9_MIcan be defined:\n\t\n    |\u03d5\u27e9_MI := ( \u2297_j=1^6\u00e2^(j)^\u2020+e^\u03d5b\u0302^(j)^\u2020/\u221a(2))\n\n\twithbeing the vacuum Fock state.

Moreover, fore^\u03d5_42=1and\u03d5_51=\u03d5_33=\u03c0/2it simplifies to the superposition of only two phase-states:\n\t\n    |\u03a8\u27e9 := |\u03a8\u27e9_MI,N=6.|_\u03d5_42=0, \u03d5_51=\u03d5_33=\u03c0/2 = e^\u03c0 / 4/\u221a(2)(|0\u27e9_MI-|\u03c0\u27e9_MI) =\n\n    = e^\u03c0 / 4/\u221a(2)( \u2297_j=1^6\u00e2^(j)^\u2020+b\u0302^(j)^\u2020/\u221a(2) - \u2297_j=1^6\u00e2^(j)^\u2020+b\u0302^(j)^\u2020/\u221a(2)) .\n\n\tThe above form of the state at the end of the ramp suggests that it is the GHZ state\u00a0(<ref>) (up to a phase factor between the two of superposed states). From the results of the simulation it is evident that the GHZ state can be produced when\u03c4\u2248 19000\u00a0E_R/\u0127(see Figure\u00a0<ref>).\n\n\n\t\n\n\u00a7 CHOICE OF THE PROPER CORRELATOR\n\n\t\n\n\tTo prove that the state|\u03a8\u27e9defined by Equation (<ref>) is entangled, the correlator of the form (<ref>) is used. The reasoning below demonstrates how to choose the directione\u20d7appearing in the definition of the correlator (<ref>) to make it useful for the system generated by the protocol. It is done for arbitrary number of sitesM; thus, in this section the state|\u03a8\u27e9takes more general form than (<ref>):\n\t\n    |\u03a8\u27e9 = C/\u221a(2)( \u2297_j=1^M\u00e2^(j)^\u2020+b\u0302^(j)^\u2020/\u221a(2) - \u2297_j=1^M\u00e2^(j)^\u2020+b\u0302^(j)^\u2020/\u221a(2)) ,\n\n\twithCbeing some phase factor (complex number of norm one). To find a proper directione\u20d7the following reasoning can be carried out:\n\n\t\n\n\t\tIf in each of M lattice sites there is exactly one atom, the lattice can be seen as a chain of M qubits, where atom in state A denotes |0\u27e9 and atom in state B denotes |1\u27e9.

It is worth mentioning that the\u015c_+^(j)operator was rotated, but conversely, the state could be rotated to get the GHZ state and the\u015c_+^(j)operator used to prove entanglement.\n\tThe next section presents the results of calculations of\n\t\n    | \ud835\udc9e|^2 := |\u27e8\u015c_rot|\u27e9|^2 = |\u27e8\u2297_j=1^M ( i\u015c^(j)_z + \u015c^(j)_y ) |\u27e9|^2\n\n\tin numerical simulations.\n\n\t\n\n\u00a7 BREAKING THE SEPARABILITY BOUND\n\n\n\tFollowing the results analysed in Section\u00a0[sec:Tuning], it was chosen to operateV_0between3 E_Rand40 E_R, to ensure that at the beginning the system remains superfluid (what guarantees entanglement generation) and it ends up in the Mott insulator phase (so that evolution is frozen). The lattice height was changed linearly during time\u03c4. To check what is the optimal speed of changing the potential, simulations with different\u03c4's were run and value of  indicating entanglement in the system at the end of evolution was observed. The results are presented in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\t\n\t\n    < g r a p h i c s >\nEach point on the plot represents a value of some variable at the end of the evolution for given \u03c4. The upper subplot shows the final values of  together with the separability bound 2^-12 (red dashed line) and the maximal possible value of  (blue line). The lower subplot presents phases \u03d5_N_AN_B. The horizontal line marks \u03c4=19100 for which the value of the correlator is maximal. For that ramp time \u03d5_42\u22480 and \u03d5_51\u2248\u03c0/2\u2248\u03d5_33 what gives GHZ-like state (see Section\u00a0[sec:InternalStructure]).\n\t\n\t\n\tIt can be observed that for ramps with ramp time\u03c4\u2208 [ 2600, 35700 ]the value of correlator  on the final state, at the end of evolution, is greater than the separability limit2^-12. It indicates that the state cannot be described by the separable state, and therefore that there is entanglement in the system (see Subsection\u00a0[subs:Witness]). Moreover, for\u03c4\u2248 19000\u00a0E_R/\u0127the value of the correlator approaches the value0.232which is close to14. It is the maximum possible value of the correlator (see Appendix\u00a0[app:MaxCorrelator]). At the same time the values of the phases of the nonzero coefficients of decomposition of the state in the Fock state basis (see Section\u00a0[sec:InternalStructure]) take the values\u03d5_42\u22480and\u03d5_51\u2248\u03c0/2\u2248\u03d5_33. These values are expected when the GHZ state  (<ref>) is realised in the system (see Section\u00a0[sec:InternalStructure]).\n\t\n\tIn the following, a single evolution of the state in a ramp with ramp time\u03c4=19000\u00a0E_R/\u0127will be considered to investigate how the entanglement does emerge in the system. The results of the simulation are presented in Figure\u00a0<ref>. Value of  during the evolution is marked with the solid green line. The red dashed line represents the separability bound (<ref>).\n\t\n\t\n    < g r a p h i c s >\nHorizontal axis marks the time of evolution and lattice height V_0 (which changes linearly with t). Vertical axis symbolises value of the correlator. Green line marks value of  during evolution of the system. Red dotted line represents the bound for separable states for M=6 subsystems and blue solid line the maximal possible value of \u20131/4. It is evident that the system breaks the separability bound and approaches highly entangled state.\n\n    It is apparent that after time2365\u00a0E_R/\u0127the state must be entangled as the value of  is greater than the separability bound. The blue line marks14\u2013 the maximum possible value of the correlator. After time10000\u00a0E_R/\u0127value of the correlator approaches14and the state becomes almost maximally entangled. When the lattice depthV_0exceeds30 E_R, the system is in the Mott insulator phase (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). Thanks to that, evolution of the state is frozen and the value of the correlator does not change anymore. Noticeably, it is a result of a numerical experiment, where decoherence processes are not taken into account.\n\n\tThe above demonstrates that it is possible to use an optical lattice filled with a few bosonic atoms to create and store the maximally entangled state. To prove that, the correlator of form (<ref>) was used. This work shows that the family of correlators  can be used to measure entanglement in an optical lattice. As  is a well-defined physical observable, it might be measured in a real experiment.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nCHAPTER: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\n\n\tThe thesis presents a protocol for generation and storage of the maximally entangled GHZ state in the Mott phase. The method can be realised experimentally with a few ultracold atomic bosons loaded into one-dimensional optical lattice potential. It can be achieved by simply preparing all the atoms in one internal state, applying\u03c0/2-pulse before the evolution and linearly changing the lattice height.\n\n\tNumerical results forN=6particles onM=6lattice sites are shown. The author has also observed a similar behaviour forN=M=4case. The same effects are expected to occur for an arbitrary large number of particles as long as the decoherence effects can be neglected. What is worth mentioning is that in the model used in the study, the number of particles per lattice site is exactly equal to one, change of the potential is slow enough that the system evolves adiabatically and are no particle losses. In the work, the correlator  was also defined. It measures the level of entanglement in the system and is a generalisation of the correlator proposed in <cit.>. To generalise the applicability of the correlator from <cit.>, analytical proofs of two inequalities: (<ref>) and (<ref>) are provided. Inequality (<ref>) is used to indicate entanglement in an optical lattice filled with an arbitrary number of particles. This inequality defines a more general class of correlators that can be used to indicate entanglement in a system. Inequality (<ref>) gives the bound for the value of the generalised correlator . It is valid for a more general class of operators and any state with the number of atoms equal the number of lattice sites. It was proven numerically that the maximal value of the correlator  can be achieved when the GHZ state is generated and stored (Figure\u00a0<ref>) in the system composed of a few ultracold atoms loaded into the optical lattice potential by using the presented protocol (Section\u00a0[sec:Protocol]).\n\n\tThe scheme can be implemented experimentally with present-day techniques and the correlator can be measured using for example quantum-gas microscopy <cit.>. The advantage of using a system with a few atoms is the high level of control one has, both for the preparation and for the measurement. The strength of the presented method is the possibility of scaling up the system size step by step by increasing the number of lattice sites or the spatial dimension. The discovered method has a potential to allow exploration of the boundary between the microscopic and the macroscopic world.\n\n\n\t\n\nCHAPTER: PROOF OF INEQUALITY [3]\n\n\n\tThis appendix contains a proof of Inequality[3](<ref>).

In the first stage, a program written in  was creating operators' matrices (particularly the matrix of the components of the Hamiltonian (<ref>)) and computing the initial state by solving the eigenproblem of the Hamiltonian. In the second stage, another program written in , was first applying\u03c0/2-pulse and then realising the numerical evolution of the state and calculating values of observables during the evolution.\n\t\n\tThe input arguments of the first program were the numbers of particles and sites (NandM) and the parameters of the lattice. First, the program generated the Fock space for givenNandM. In the created Fock space, matrices representing the Hamiltonian and other observables were obtained. Then the eigenproblem for the Hamiltonian's matrix has been solved to find the initial ground state. The matrices of the operators as well as the ground state were sent as the input for the second program.\n\t\n\tThe second program, basing on the output from the first one, was rotating the initial state by\u03c0/2-pulse and evolving it. Every time step of the evolution consisted of calculation of the Hamiltonian for a given moment of time and Runge-Kutta evolution according to Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Every few time steps, the values of interesting observables were calculated to get an insight into the evolution.\n\t\n\n\ttoc\n\nCHAPTER: EVOLUTION FOR N=2: ANALYTICAL RESULTS\n\n\n\tIn this appendix a semi-analytical method used to describe the dynamics of the system withN=M=2is presented.
