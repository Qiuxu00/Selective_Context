These structures are given by discrete structures \u2013 graphs with additional information. These graphs are often embedded in a surface, the resulting invariants are discrete Morse functions. There is a natural equivalence on the set of such functions, first explored in the papers of Forman <cit.>. At the same time, the equivalence class is given by a discrete gradient vector field. In the most general case, such fields and functions are considered on regular cellular complexes. The most useful discrete functions and vector fields are those that have the smallest number of critical cells in a given space, among all possible functions and vector fields on the regular cellular decomposition with minimal number of cells. Such fields are called optimal. Therefore, it is important to study the structure of such fields.\n\n\nGraphs as topological invariants of functions were used in the papers of Kronrod <cit.> and Reeb <cit.> for oriented maniofolds, in <cit.> for  non-orientable two-dimensional manifolds and in   <cit.> for manifolds with boundary, in <cit.> for non-compact manifolds. \n\nIn general, Morse vector fields (Morse-Smale vector fields without closed orbits) are gradient field of Morse functions. If we fix the value of functions in singular points the field determinate the topological structure of the function <cit.>. Therefore, Morse\u2013Smale vector fields classification is closely related to the classification of the functions.\n\nTopological classification of smooth function on closed 2-manifolds was also investigated in <cit.>, on 2-manifolds with the boundary in <cit.> and on closed 3-manifolds in  <cit.>. \n\n\nIn <cit.>, \nthe classifications of flows on closed 2- manifolds and \n<cit.> on manifolds with the boundary were obtained.\nTopological properties of Morse-Smale vector fields on 3-manifolds was investigated in <cit.>.\n\n\n\nThe main invariants of graphs and their embeddings in surfaces can be founded in <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\nThe main purpose of this paper is to study the topological properties of the optimal discrete gradient vector fields on surface with one or two critical cells. These fields have and minimal number of critical cell on the regular cellular complex with minimal number of cells.\n\n\nThe first section gives the basic definitions and topological properties of discrete Morse functions and discrete gradient vector fields.\n\nIn the second section we describe all possible structures of optimal discrete vector flows on a two-dimensional disk, in the third section \u2013 on a two-dimensional sphere, in the fourth section \u2013 on the cylinder, and in the fifth section \u2013 on a Mobius strip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISCRETE MORSE FUNCTIONS AND VECTOR FIELD \n\n\nIf a cell (or simplicial) complex K is given, then a discrete function is a mapping that matches each simplex with a real number.\nIf the structure of a cellular complex (triangulation) is given on the manifold M, then for the function f: M \u2192\u211d we take the value in the center of each cell (simplex). Thus, we  construct a discrete Morse function. On the contrary, if a Morse function is given on a triangulated manifold, then it determines the value of the function at the center of each simplex. Consider the first barycentric sub-division. For it, we have the value of the function at each vertex. By linearity, we extend the function to each simplex, thereby obtaining a piecewise linear function on the manifold. With the help of smoothing, you can get a smooth function from it. Similar constructions can be made for regular cage complexes.\n\nForman approach based on the use of discrete gradient flows was proposed in <cit.>.These designs are easier to build algorithms and implement on computers.\n\nOn the set of simplexes (cells) of the K complex, we introduce the order relation:\n\n    \u03c4 < \u03c3\u21d4\u03c4\u2282\u03c3, \u03c4\u03c3.\n\n\nBy |A| we denote the number of elements of the set A.\n\n\nThe function f: K \u2192\u211d is called a discrete Morse function if for an arbitrary simplex (cell) \u03c3 of dimension k:\n\n\n    |\u03c4^k-1: \u03c4^k-1<\u03c3, f(\u03c4^k-1) \u2265 f(\u03c3)| +\n    |\u03c4^k+1: \u03c4^k+1>\u03c3, f(\u03c4^k+1) \u2264 f(\u03c3)| \u2264 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n    |\u03c4^k-1: \u03c4^k-1<\u03c3, f(\u03c4^k-1) \u2265 f(\u03c3)| +\n    |\u03c4^k+1: \u03c4^k+1>\u03c3, f(\u03c4^k+1) \u2264 f(\u03c3)| = 0.\n\n\nSimplexes that are not critical are called regular.\n\n\nA discrete Morse function is called simple if it takes different values on different critical simplexes (cells).\n\n\nA discrete vector field on the complex K is the set of pairs V={ (\u03c3, \u03c4) } for which \u03c3, \u03c4\u2208 K, \u03c3 <\u03c4, dim \u03c3 = \u03c4 +1 and each simplex (cell) of the complex can belong to no more than one pair. Each such pair is called a vector and is represented by an arrow directed from the center of the first simplex (cell) to the center of the second.\n\n\n\n\nThe gradient vector field V_f of the discrete Morse function\nis called the field \n    V_f={\u03c3^(k), \u03c4^(k+1): \u03c3^(k)<\u03c4^(k+1), f( \u03c3^(k)) \u2265 f( \u03c4^(k+1)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fig. <ref> shows the discrete Morse function on the torus and its gradient field. Critical cells are: 1) vertex 0, 2) edges {1,2} and {3,4}, 3) 2- cell [5,6,8,7].\n\nThe index of a critical cell (simplex) is its dimension.\n\n\nThe gradient path of a discrete vector field V is called a sequence of cells (simplexes)\n\n    \u03c4_0, \u03c3_1, \u03c4_1, \u2026, \u03c3_m-1 , \u03c4_m-1,\u03c3_m\n\nsuch that \n    (\u03c3_i, \u03c4_i)\u2208 V, \u03c3_i< \u03c4_i-1, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, \u03c3_0=\u03c3_m.\n\n\n\nExamples of gradient paths on <ref> b): 1) two paths from {1,2} to {0} \u2013 {1,2},{1} ,{0,1},{0} and {1,2},{2},{0,2},{0}; 2) two paths from [5,6,8,7] to {1,2} \u2013 [5,6,8,7],{5,6},[1, 2,6,5],{1,2} and [5,6,8,7], {5,6}, [1,2,6,5],{2,6 },  [2,0,3,6],{3,6},[6,3,4,8],{8,4},[8,4,0,2 ],{2,8},[8,2,1,7],{2,1}.\n\n\n\n\n    \u03c4 < \u03c3\u21d4\u03c4\u2282\u03c3, \u03c4\u03c3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo  discrete vector field are called isomorphic if there is an isomorphism of the CW-complexes which preserve the pairs.\n\n\nOur aim  is to describe all possible up to isomorphism structures of flows with one or two critical cell. \n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISCRETE VECTOR FIELDS ON THE 2-DISK\n\nSince a 2-disk is homotopically equivalent to a point, any discrete gradient vector field on it will have a critical 0-cell. The optimal cellular partition of the 2-disk is a triangle - 3 vertices, 3 edges and one face (it cannot be less, since there must be at least three vertices and three edges on the boundary of the surface to fulfill the definition of a regular cellular complex). To specify discrete vector fields on a 2-disk, we use the numbering and notation of cells, as in Fig. <ref>.\n\n\nSince the 2-cell is not critical, it belongs to one pair. Without loss of generality, we can assume that this is a pair of cA. Note that there is an axial symmetry that preserves this pair. Taking it into account, there are two possibilities for choosing a critical 0-cell: 0 or 1. In the first case, we will find such a vector field: \n\n    V_1={1a, 2b, cA}.\n In the second case, the vector field is \n    V_2={0a, 2b, cA}.\n\n\nThus, the following is true.\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic optimal discrete vector fields on the 2-disk is equal 2.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISCRETE VECTOR FIELDS ON THE 2-SPHERE\n\n\nAccording to the discrete Morse theory, an optimal discrete gradient vector field on a 2-sphere has one critical 0-cell and one critical 2-cell. An optimal regular CW-complex of a sphere has four 0-cells, six 1-cells, and four 2-cells. Let us denote the cells of the regular cell partition as shown in Fig. <ref>.\n\n\n\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that the critical 2-cell is cell B. If none of the 1-cells (e, d, f) bordering it are in pairs with 2-cells, then they form a cycle, which is impossible. Thus, three cases are possible: 1) one of these cells is paired with a 2-cell (eA), 2) two pairs (eA and fC), 3) three pairs (eA, fC and dD). In the first case, there are 2 variant:\n\n    V_1-3={\u2026, eA, aD, cC},\n\n\n    V_4-7={\u2026, eA, aD, bC}.\n\n\nBy V_1-3 we denote next three vector fields: \n\nIn the first variant it is possible to select the critical vertex in 3 ways (due to symmetry):\n\n    V_1={2b,1d,3f, eA, aD, cC},\n\n\n    V_2={0b,2d,3f, eA, aD, cC},\n\n\n    V_3={0b,1d,3f, eA, aD, cC}.\n \nIn the second variant we have 4 vector fields:\n\n    V_4={1d,2f,3c, eA, aD, bC},\n\n\n    V_5={0c,2d,3f, eA, aD, bC},\n\n\n    V_6={0c,1d,3f, eA, aD, bC},\n\n\n    V_7={0c,1d,2f, eA, aD, bC}.\n\nIn the second case \n    V_8-11={\u2026, eA, fC, aD}\n there are four ways for critical vertex location. \n\nIn the third case \n    V_12-13={\u2026, eA, dD, fC}\n there are two ways for critical vertex location.\nThus, the following is true.\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic optimal discrete vector fields on the 2-sphere is equal 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISCRETE VECTOR FIELDS ON THE CYLINDER \n \nThe optimal structure of the cell complex on a cylinder consists of three 2-cells, quadrilaterals, glued in a circle. All vertices in it are equal. Let's assign number 0 to the critical vertex. We cut the cylinder along the glue, ending at this vertex. we get a rectangle divided into three squares. We number its cells as in Fig. <ref>.\n\nNote that an optimal vector field has one critical vertex and a critical edge. There is one non-trivial isomorphism of the cell complex onto itself, which is fixed at the critical vertex. On fig. 3 it corresponds to axial symmetry about the vertical axis.\n\nThe vector field is determined by the pairs that contain the 2-cell and the location of the critical 1-cell. The following options are possible:\n\t \n    V_1-3={\u2026, aA, bB, iC}, \t V_4-6={\u2026, aA, bB, fC}, \t V_7-9={\u2026, gA, bB, aC},  \t V_10-12={\u2026, gA, bB, iC},\n\n\t\n    V_13-15={\u2026, gA, bB, cC},  \tV_16-20={\u2026, gA, bB, fC},  \tV_21-23={\u2026, dA, bB, aC},\n\n\t \n    V_24-28={\u2026, dA, bB, iC},  \t V_29-31={\u2026, dA, bB, cC},  \t V_32-34={\u2026, dA, bB, fC},\n\n\t \n    V_35-39={\u2026, gA, eB, aC},  \t V_40-44={\u2026, gA, eB, iC},  \t V_44-49={\u2026, gA, eB, cC},\n\n\t \n    V_50-54={\u2026, gA, eB, fC},  \t V_55-57={\u2026, aA, eB, cC}, \t V_58-60={\u2026, aA, eB, fC},\n\n\t \n    V_61-63={\u2026, bA, eB, cC},  \n    \t V_64-66={\u2026, bA, eB, fC}, \t V_67-69={\u2026, dA, eB, fC},\n\n\t \n    V_70-72={\u2026, gA, hB, aC},  \t V_73-75={\u2026, gA, hB, iC},  \t V_76-78={\u2026, gA, hB, cC},\n\n\t \n    V_79-83={\u2026, gA, hB, fC},   \n    \t V_84-86={\u2026, aA, hB, cC},  \t V_87-91={\u2026, aA, hB, fC},\n\n\t \n    V_92-94={\u2026, bA, hB, cC}, \t V_95-99={\u2026, bA, hB, fC},  \t V_100-104={\u2026, dA, hB, fC}.\n\n\nThus, the following is true.\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic optimal discrete vector fields on the cylinder S^1\u00d7 [0,1]  is equal 104.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISCRETE VECTOR FIELDS ON THE MOBIUS BAND\n\n\nThe case with the Mobius band is similar to the case with the cylinder. The axial symmetry of the rectangle is replaced by central symmetry. Cell designations are shown in fig. 4.\n\n\nThe vector field is determined by the pairs that contain the 2-cell and the location of the critical 1-cell. The following options are possible:\n\t \n    V_1-4={\u2026, aA, bB, iC}, \t V_5-8={\u2026, aA, bB, fC}, \t V_9-12={\u2026, gA, bB, aC},  \t V_13-16={\u2026, gA, bB, iC},\n\n\t\n    V_17-20={\u2026, gA, bB, cC},  \tV_21-24={\u2026, gA, bB, fC},  \tV_25-28={\u2026, dA, bB, aC},\n\n\t \n    V_29-32={\u2026, dA, bB, iC},  \t V_33-36={\u2026, dA, bB, cC},  \t V_37-40={\u2026, dA, bB, fC},\n\n\t \n    V_41-44={\u2026, gA, eB, aC},  \t V_45-50={\u2026, gA, eB, iC},  \t V_51-54={\u2026, gA, eB, cC},\n\n\t \n    V_55-58={\u2026, gA, eB, fC},  \t V_59-62={\u2026, aA, eB, cC}, \t V_63-66={\u2026, aA, eB, iC},\n\n\t \n    V_58-70={\u2026, aA, eB, fC},  \t V_71-74={\u2026, bA, eB, cC},  \n    \t V_75-78={\u2026, bA, eB, iC},\n\n\t \n    V_79-82={\u2026, bA, eB, aC}, \t V_83-86={\u2026, bA, eB, fC}, \t V_87-90={\u2026, dA, eB, aC},\n\n\t\n    V_91-94={\u2026, dA, eB, iC },  \tV_95-98={\u2026, dA, eB, fC},  \tV_99-102={\u2026, dA, eB, cC}.\n\n\n\nThus, the following is true.\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic optimal discrete vector fields on the cylinder S^1\u00d7 [0,1]  is equal 102.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSION\n\nThe results of the article prove the effectiveness of the proposed invariants (distinguishing graph and code) for classifying flows on a two-dimensional disk with one singular point. We hope that they can be used to construct similar invariants for flows with a large number of singular points on other surfaces as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nakchurin2022three\nO.\u00a0Akchurin, S.\u00a0Bilun, and A.\u00a0Prishlyak.\nThree-color graph as the 1-skeleton of the 2-sphere triangulation.\narXiv preprint arXiv:2209.05737, 2022.\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2209.05737 doi: 10.48550/ARXIV.2209.05737.\n\nbilun2002closed\nS.\u00a0Bilun and A.\u00a0Prishlyak.\nThe closed morse 1-forms on closed surfaces.\nVisn., Mat.
