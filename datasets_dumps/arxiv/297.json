If these anomalies are physical, i.e. not due to systematics, they naively suggest that H_0 decreases and S_8 increases with effective redshift. Here, on the assumption that matter density parameter today \u03a9_m is a constant, we show that S_8 determinations from f \u03c3_8(z) constraints increase with effective redshift, thereby providing corroborating support for an S_8 discrepancy that is physical in origin. Results here and elsewhere suggest that the \u039bCDM cosmological parameters are redshift dependent. Fitting parameters that evolve with redshift is a recognisable hallmark of model breakdown.  \n            S_8 increases with effective redshift in \u039bCDM cosmology\n                A. A. Sen\n                March 30, 2023\n            =======================================================\n            \n            \n            \n            \u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n             \n            Modern cosmology is a pursuit where one theoretically guesses a function (or model) and compares it to another a priori unknown function, the Hubble parameter H(z), extracted observationally from Nature. Given the possibilities, the guess is invariably wrong, but existing cosmological data can mask disagreement until precision improves. Viewed historically, concordance  Lambda cold dark matter (\u039bCDM) cosmology emerged when a spatially flat, homogeneous & isotropic Universe, filled exclusively with radiation and (pressure-less) matter, required a dark energy sector to explain observations\u00a0<cit.>. Further improvements in data in recent years have unveiled anomalies in the Hubble constant H_0 := H(z=0)\u00a0<cit.>, the weighted amplitude of matter fluctuations S_8 := \u03c3_8 \u221a(\u03a9_m/0.3)\u00a0<cit.>, the lensing parameter A_lens and/or curvature \u03a9_k\u00a0<cit.>, the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect\u00a0<cit.>, and high redshift galaxies that seemingly defy \u039bCDM expectations\u00a0<cit.>. See\u00a0<cit.> for reviews of \u039bCDM anomalies. It is plausible that the (flat) \u039bCDM cosmological model is breaking down. What remains is to confirm this diagnosis. \n            \n            To that end, a simple insight comes directly to us from the Friedmann equations; H_0 is by construction an integration constant. In other words, it is theoretically a constant within the Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework on which \u039bCDM is established by assuming spatial flatness. Nevertheless, it is observationally a constant only when one has the correct cosmological model\u00a0<cit.>. This statement is true not only for H_0, but also for other model parameters that are integration constants, such as matter density parameter (today) \u03a9_m:=\u03c1_m0/3H_0^2 (\u03c1_m0 being the matter energy density today) in the \u039bCDM model. Thus,  if the \u039bCDM model is breaking down, as all cosmological models must at some precision for the reason outlined above, one expects H_0, \u03a9_m, etc, to evolve with effective redshift. There are now numerous observations suggesting that H_0 evolves,  more accurately decreases with effective redshift\u00a0<cit.> (see also\u00a0<cit.>). Likewise there are claims of \u03a9_m increasing with effective redshift\u00a0<cit.> (see also \n            <cit.>). Furthermore, it has been noted in\u00a0<cit.> that evolution of H_0 and \u03a9_m within \u039bCDM are anti-correlated with each other. Note that if \u03a9_m evolves with effective redshift, it is unlikely that S_8 is a constant, because \u03c3_8 conspiring to balance evolution in \u03a9_m represents a contrived scenario. \n            \n            Here we focus on the S_8 discrepancy\u00a0<cit.>. Taken at face value, this anomaly says that S_8 as inferred by Planck collaboration (high redshift inference) has a larger value than the one from galaxy surveys (low redshift measurement).\n            This can be independently verified with growth rate data, in particular measurements of f \u03c3_8 (z), which are independent of galaxy bias. Concretely, we will assume expressions that are valid for \u039bCDM cosmology and fit f \u03c3_8 (z) constraints in bins of varying effective redshift. However, since growth rate data suffers from large fractional errors, we will leverage a working assumption in modern cosmology that \u03a9_m is a constant to elucidate the trend. This means that the increases observed in S_8 are driven by increases in \u03c3_8. Interestingly, this effect is also evident when one compares low redshift \u03c3_8 constraints from clusters with high redshift \u03c3_8 constraints from Lyman-\u03b1 data\u00a0<cit.>. Admittedly, \u03a9_m may not be a constant\u00a0<cit.>, but this is currently a fringe viewpoint. Our goal in this letter is to explore evolution of S_8\n            within \u039bCDM in the late Universe under standard assumptions. \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \u00a7 WARM UP\n             \n            To get oriented, we impose a Gaussian prior, \u03a9_m = 0.3111 \u00b1 0.0056, which arises from combining Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), galaxy, quasar and Lyman-\u03b1 baryon acoustic oscillation  (BAO) constraints\u00a0<cit.>. The CMB+BAO prior is needed to compensate for the relatively low quality of the  growth rate data, which is further reduced through binning. Compared to Planck <cit.>, it is marginally more constraining, but remains representative of a Planck prior. In the absence of Gaussian priors, we employ generous uniform priors \u03a9_m \u223c\ud835\udcb0 (0, 1.5), in addition to \u03c3_8 \u223c\ud835\udcb0(0, 3) throughout. \n            We combine this prior with 20 measurements of f \u03c3_8 (z) from peculiar velocity and redshift-space distortion (RSD) data\u00a0<cit.>, as compiled recently in\u00a0<cit.>. We illustrate the constraints in Fig.\u00a0<ref>\n            in red. We will be interested in the combination \n            \n            S_8 := \u03c3_8\u221a(\u03a9_m/0.3), \n            \n            where the constant \u03c3_8 is the amplitude of mass fluctuations in spheres of 8 h^-1 Mpc with h:=H_0/100  km s^-1 Mpc^-1. Following\u00a0<cit.>, we introduce the matter density parameter\n            \u03a9(z) := \u03a9_m (1+z)^3/1- \u03a9_m + \u03a9_m (1+z)^3, \n            \n            thereby allowing us to obtain \n            \n            f \u03c3_8 (z)  = \u03c3_8 \u03a9^6/11(z) exp( - \u222b_0^z\u03a9^6/11(z^')/1+z^' z^').    \n            \n            As explained in\u00a0<cit.>, these expressions are valid for \u039bCDM and represent a good approximation to the growth of large scale structure in the linear regime. For all redshifts z, the function \u03a9(z) is bounded \u03a9_m\u2264\u03a9 (z)  <1. In particular, \u03a9\u2192 1 as z \u2192\u221e, so that \u03a9_m dependence drops out as an overall factor in (<ref>) at high redshifts, but some knowledge of \u03a9_m is retained through the integral. \n            \n            The green curve in Fig.\u00a0<ref> denotes the best fit of the \u039bCDM model to the 20 data points, whereas the blue curve documents the effect of introducing the Gaussian prior on \u03a9_m. It is worth noting that this increases the S_8 inference and visibly worsens the fit to the f \u03c3_8 (z) constraints at z \u2248 0 and z \u2248 1.5, thereby underscoring the tension between the \u03a9_m prior and the lower value of \u03a9_m preferred by f \u03c3_8 (z) data. The blue curve worsens the fit to f \u03c3_8 (z) data by \u0394\u03c7^2 \u2248 4.9. The f \u03c3_8 (z) constraints are weak while the Gaussian prior is strong. Therefore, the prior effectively fixes \u03a9_m, so that the only parameter being fitted is \u03c3_8. As is clear from (<ref>), one is simply fitting the scale of the f \u03c3_8(z) function, whereas the functional form is fixed. In Fig.\u00a0<ref> we see the effect of removing f \u03c3_8 (z) constraints below z = z_min. We see that with \u03a9_m constrained through the prior, \u03c3_8 increases leading to larger values of S_8. As S_8 increases, the curves visibly provide a better fit to high redshift f \u03c3_8 (z) constraints. This increase in S_8 is driven by the two high redshift data points and is expected, even without performing data analysis.   \n            \n            We next split the f \u03c3_8(z) data at z= 0.7 into a low redshift sample of 14 data points and a high redshift sample of 6 data points. This choice is arbitrary, but it is guided by Fig.\u00a0<ref> and the intuition that evolution in S_8 is expected once we see evolution in H_0\u00a0<cit.> and \u03a9_m\u00a0<cit.> elsewhere. We impose the Gaussian prior on \u03a9_m to each sample and perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The result is shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, where in line with expectations from Fig.\u00a0<ref>, the contours separate in the \u03c3_8 or S_8 direction. The contours are Gaussian, allowing us to directly compare S_8 = 0.752 \u00b1 0.015(z < 0.7) to S_8 = 0.841 \u00b1 0.036(z \u2265 0.7) and conclude that the discrepancy in S_8 is 2.3 \u03c3. \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \u00a7 LARGER DATA SET\n            \n            Given that the increase in S_8 is driven exclusively by two high redshift data points, it is prudent to work with a larger data set. To that end, we focus on Table II of\u00a0<cit.>, where one finds 63 historical measurements of f \u03c3_8(z)\u00a0<cit.>. We add more recent data from\u00a0<cit.> to increase the sample to 66 data points. We observe that Refs.\u00a0<cit.> are common to both data sets in Fig.\u00a0<ref> and Fig.\u00a0<ref>. The other data points are the work of independent groups, but as cautioned in\u00a0<cit.>, most analyses of growth rate data, e.g.\u00a0<cit.>, tend to pick 20 odd data points to counteract any overcounting of data. However, this choice of independent data points is largely subjective. Moreover, different studies make use of different fiducial cosmologies. To address this latter concern, we follow equation (2.6) of <cit.> (see also\u00a0<cit.>) and  correct for this choice of fiducial model by performing a rescaling by the combination H(z) D_A(z), where H(z) and D_A(z) denote the Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance at a given z. Note, following <cit.>, we did not perform this correction in the last section.   \n            \n            In Fig.\u00a0<ref> we show the effect of removing f \u03c3_8(z) constraints below z = z_min. Where relevant, e.g.\u00a0<cit.>, we crop covariance matrices accordingly as we remove data points. Our strong Gaussian prior on \u03a9_m ensures that our a posteriori distributions from MCMC analysis remain Gaussian. As a result, the 1 \u03c3 errors in Fig.\u00a0<ref> are representative. The reader will note that, in line with expectations, the size of the error bar increases as we remove data. Furthermore, the error bars in Fig.\u00a0<ref> are correlated, because all plotted constraints larger than a given z_min share data points.  \n            \n            We can address criticism regarding the correlated constraints in Fig.\u00a0<ref> by simply splitting the sample into independent subsamples. Our results in Fig.\u00a0<ref> suggest that any split at z \u223c 1 may maximise the discrepancy between low redshift and high redshift subsamples. The choice is somewhat arbitrary, as it depends on the composition or makeup of the overall sample, notably redshift distribution and quality of the data. For this reason, the split here is conducted at z = 1.1, whereas it was z = 0.7 in the previous section. Note that our sample here now has an extended range, so we can explore higher redshift splits of the sample. Concretely, we find that a split at z= 1.1 leads to S_8 = 0.732 \u00b1 0.010 at lower redshifts and S_8 = 0.906 \u00b1 0.043 at higher redshifts, with a tension at 3.9 \u03c3. While the discrepancy is large, not all of our data points are independent, so this constitutes an overestimation. The main point here is that the S_8 trend is robust to changes in the data set. Of course, evolution in S_8 within the \u039bCDM model is expected if evolution of cosmological parameters is seen elsewhere <cit.>.  \n            \n            \n            \n            \u00a7 CONCLUSIONS\n            \n            Binning data is not a crime. Neither is fitting a dynamical model, here the \u039bCDM model, to binned data in different temporal epochs, alternatively different redshift ranges. Either from the Friedmann equations directly, or the continuity equation and the assumption of pressure-less matter, both H_0 and \u03a9_m arise mathematically as integration constants. Thus, consistency demands that both H_0 and \u03a9_m are observationally constants. Similarly, \u03c3_8 is an integration constant of linear growth equations\u00a0<cit.>. Here, working within these assumptions, we have shown that the S_8 \u2261\u03c3_8 \u221a(\u03a9_m/0.3) parameter increases with effective redshift in the late Universe, z \u2272 2. This evolution is compelling because it corroborates the tendency of cosmic shear to give lower values of S_8 than Planck-\u039bCDM\u00a0<cit.>. Moreover, it is not an isolated observation and it has been noted that \u03c3_8 constraints from low redshift clusters are biased lower than high redshift Lyman-\u03b1 constraints with statistical significance \u223c 3.3 \u03c3\u00a0<cit.>. In <cit.>, systematics are a greater concern as one is comparing different observables, but here we are working with common f \u03c3_8(z) constraints throughout. However, these differences aside, we agree on the increasing \u03c3_8 trend.  \n            \n            Concretely, we presented analysis in a sample of 20 and 66 f \u03c3_8(z) constraints respectively. In both samples we find the same increasing S_8 trend, which is essentially a \u03c3_8 trend, because \u03a9_m is subject to a strong prior. Since there is considerable survey overlap in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, the tension between low and high redshift is admittedly overestimated at 3.9 \u03c3 (Fig.\u00a0<ref>). That being said, if the 20 data points in Fig.\u00a0<ref> are independent (Ref.\u00a0<cit.> assumes they are), then any discrepancy is bounded below by 2.3 \u03c3. This places the tension in the 2-4 \u03c3 range. Forthcoming releases from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)\u00a0<cit.> will be in a position to settle the matter. Our results also provide a targeted prediction for tomographic studies of cosmic shear <cit.>. These surveys, i. e. HSC, KiDS and DES, currently employ redshift bins with varying effective redshift across the surveys and shifts in cosmological parameters up to 1 \u03c3 are evident. Given our results here, it is plausible that S_8 evolution will be detected as cosmic shear data quality improves. Finally, our results caution theoretically that physics that alters the radius of the sound horizon\u00a0<cit.> cannot account for these expected hallmarks of model breakdown.  \n            \n            \n            \n            \u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n            \n            We thank Dragan Huterer, Leandros Perivolaropoulos, Sunny Vagnozzi, and Matteo Viel for correspondence on related topics. \u00d6A acknowledges the support by the Turkish Academy of Sciences in the scheme of the Outstanding Young Scientist Award (T\u00dcBA-GEB\u0130P). \u00d6A is supported in part by TUBITAK grant 122F124.
