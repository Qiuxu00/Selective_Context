We analyze in detail the sector with one electric charge and one magnetic flux and show that the spectrum in this sector consists of both bound states and scattering states of abelian anyons. Concretely, we have defined a family of lattice models in which abelian anyons arise naturally as finite-size quasi-particles with non-trivial dynamics that consist of a charge-flux pair. In particular, the anyons exhibit a non-trivial holonomy with a quantized phase, consistent with the gauge and duality symmetries of the Hamiltonian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n   \n\nWhen Leinaas and Myrheim published their remarkable paper <cit.>, the possibility of a new type of quasi-particles in two space dimensions with more general statistics than the well-established fermions and bosons, was a purely theoretical observation. This changed abruptly with the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) by Tsui, Stormer, and Gossard <cit.> and Laughlin's many-body wave function <cit.> as a proposed explanation shortly after the experimental discovery. Wilczek called these hypothetical particles with fractional statistics anyons <cit.> and they quickly became a central piece of many theoretical works on the FQHE <cit.>. Convincing experimental evidence for the existence of anyonic excitations in fractional quantum Hall materials has emerged in recent experiments <cit.>. \n\nAll this motivated several efforts to construct explicit Hamiltonian models of anyons and study their mathematical and physical properties. Many of such efforts focus on interpreting anyons as charge and flux tube pairs <cit.>. A relation between the filling fraction and the ground state degeneracy was proved in <cit.> for lattice models and in <cit.> for the Laughlin state. Haldane's pseudo-potential Hamiltonians have been derived in <cit.>. A truncated version of a pseudo-potential for the \u03bd=1/3 filled Laughlin state introduced in <cit.> was shown to have a non-vanishing ground state gap in <cit.>. Other aspects were investigated in a variety of models <cit.>.\n\nThe possibility of topological quantum computation envisaged in\u00a0<cit.> has been a further incentive to deepen our understanding of anyons. Among the Hamiltonian models in two dimensions developed for that purpose, the most famous ones are Kitaev's quantum double models <cit.> and his honeycomb model <cit.>, as well as the Levin-Wen string-net models\u00a0<cit.>. They do exhibit localized excitations with anyonic statistics, can be extended to describe anyon condensation\u00a0<cit.>, but these quasi-particles are not dynamical. In fact, the main purpose of these models is to realize, in their ground state space, a topological quantum field theory\u00a0<cit.>. This has led to further developments in the classification of topological matter in the language of tensor categories\u00a0<cit.>. Experimental realizations of these exotic topological phases have recently been proposed\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nThese rigorous results recover some of the features of anyons in the theories for the FQHE mentioned above but it is fair to say that we are still lacking a coherent theory starting from first principles. In this paper we present Hamiltonian lattice models of anyons with short-range interactions of the type prevalent in condensed matter theories of real materials. It may also be realizable as an artificial system created in today's laboratories. We introduce our models as perturbations of Kitaev's quantum double models based on an arbitrary abelian group G and rely on the stability of its anyon structure under short-range perturbations proved in <cit.>. This generalizes earlier work on the case of G=_2, which starts with the Toric Code model <cit.>. These models have a unique gapped ground state on the infinite lattice, and the excitation spectrum can be described by a set of abelian anyons. They have a duality symmetry which is reflected in the structure of the anyons: they consist of two basic sets, which we call electric and magnetic charges that appear symmetrically in the Hamiltonian. Anyons that have both non-zero electric and magnetic charges obtained by fusion, appear with their own dispersion relation. We calculate the dispersion relation for single-anyon excitations and show that it exhibits a Dirac cone for these fused anyons with non-trivial braiding statistics.  We show that under a simple condition on the coupling constants and the energy and momentum, bound states appear that should be interpreted as finite-size quasi-particles with non-trivial dynamics. We also prove that bounds states do not appear when the Hamiltonian only includes separate hopping terms for electric and magnetic charges. In summary, we have constructed a family of lattice models in which abelian anyons arise naturally as charge-flux pairs with the expected properties. We explicitly find that the anyons exhibit a non-trivial holonomy with a quantized phase, consistent with the gauge and duality symmetries of the Hamiltonian. There is no need to introduce charge-flux pairs or tracer particles a priori <cit.>. The anyonic holonomy as observed in <cit.> arises directly from the many-body Hamiltonian.\n\nIn Section <ref> we introduce the family of Hamiltonians, discuss their symmetry properties, and describe the structure of the anyons and the associated superselection sectors for these models, including concrete instances of the corresponding GNS representations. The spectral analysis of the Hamiltonian in the invariant subspaces of the relevant GNS representations is carried out in Section <ref>. We illustrate our findings with a set of figures based on numerical calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE MODEL\n   \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The (static) quantum double model\n\n\nLet us start with a quick reminder of the family of quantum double models (QDMs) with a finite Abelian group (G,\u00b7), which will allow us to set notations. We denote by \u0393 the cell complex given by a set \ud835\udcb1 = ^2 of vertices, a set \u2130 of oriented edges and a set \u2131 of faces. We denote by \u2202 the standard boundary map of this cell complex. For simplicity, all `vertical' edges are oriented upwards while all `horizontal' edges are pointing rightward. We attach to each edge e\u2208 the | G|-dimensional Hilbert space \u210b_e = \u2102^| G| and label an orthonormal basis by group elements g \u2208 G: {|g\u27e9_e:g\u2208 G}; If a statement is not specific to one particular edge, we shall simply denote . The observable algebra associated with each edge is _e = (_e). For any finite subset \u039b\u2282, the algebra is given by _\u039b = (\u2297_e\u2208\u039b_e). As usual, \u039b_1\u2282\u039b_2 yields a natural embedding _\u039b_1\u21aa_\u039b_2 by the identification of A\u2208_\u039b_1 with A\u2297__\u039b_2\u2216\u039b_2. The algebra of local observables _loc is the union of these finite volume algebras, and the C*-algebra of quasi-local observables  is the completion of _loc with respect to the operator norm.\n\nFor any h\u2208 G, let L^h be the linear operator defined by its action on the basis:\n\n\n    L^h|g\u27e9 = |hg\u27e9.\n\n\nSimilarly, for any character \u03c7\u2208\u011c, let T^\u03c7 be the linear operator defined by\n\n\n    T^\u03c7|g\u27e9 = \u03c7\u0305(g)|g\u27e9,\n\n\nwhere \u03c7\u0305 denotes the inverse of the character \u03c7. These operators form a unitary representation of G, respectively \u011c, on , and (L^h) = L^h\u0305, (T^\u03c7) = T^\u03c7, where h\u0305=h^-1, the inverse in G. Moreover, they satisfy the following commutation relation:\n\n\n    T^\u03c7 L^h = \u03c7\u0305(h)L^hT^\u03c7.\n\n\n\nIt will be convenient to label operators not only by an edge, but by pairs (v,e) with v\u2208\u2202 e or (f,e) with e\u2208\u2202 f. For a vertex-edge pair, ^h(v,e) = L^h_e and ^\u03c7(v,e) = T^\u03c7_e if the edge is outgoing from v, while ^h(v,e) = L^h\u0305_e and ^\u03c7(v,e) = T^\u03c7\u0305_e if it is incoming. Similarly for a face-edge pair with incoming (respectively outgoing) being replaced by the face being on the left (respectively on the right) of the edge. These conventions are illustrated in Figure\u00a0<ref>. \n\n\n\nA string \u03b3 is a sequence of pairs {(v_i,e_i):v_i\u2208, e_i\u2208} such that \u2202 e_i = {v_i,v_i+1}. If it is finite, the last vertex is not listed but it is uniquely determined by (v_N,e_N) and we denote it \u2202_1\u03b3; analogously, \u2202_0\u03b3 = v_1, and we let \u2202\u03b3 = {\u2202_0\u03b3,\u2202_1\u03b3}. We define similarly a dual string \u03b3, where faces replace vertices, and the edge e_i is the unique edge in \u2202 f_i\u2229\u2202 f_i+1, see Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n We now define the following unitary string operators\n\n    ^g_\u03b3 = (f,e) \u2208\u03b3\u220f\u2112^g (f ,e)    ^\u03c7_\u03b3= (v,e) \u2208\u03b3\u220f\ud835\udcaf^\u03c7 (v ,e)\n\nfor g\u2208 G, \u03c7\u2208\u011c. Note that the order in which the operators appear is irrelevant in the present context. The boundary of a face f\u2208\u2131 is naturally associated with a string \u03b3(f), while a vertex v \u2208\ud835\udcb1 is naturally associated with a dual string \u03b3(v). We shall always consider these strings to carry a counterclockwise orientation. We define for any face f and vertex v \n\n    ^h_f= 1/|\u011c|\u2211_\u03c7\u2208\u011c\u03c7(h) ^\u03c7_\u03b3(f),\n        \u03c7_v= 1/| G|\u2211_g \u2208 G\u03c7(g)^g_\u03b3(v).\n\nThe normalization is chosen so as to make these operators into (orthogonal) projections, and one can check that they are mutually commuting: In fact,\n\n\n    _v^\u03c7_v^\u03be = \u03b4_\u03c7,\u03be_v^\u03c7 = _v^\u03be_v^\u03c7,    _f^g_f^h = \u03b4_g,h_f^g = _f^h _f^g,\n\n\nby the orthogonality of the characters. Their action on basis vectors is illustrated in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\nFor any finite subset \u039b\u2282, the Hamiltonian of the (static) quantum double model is given by\n\n    H^0_\u039b = v\u2208\u039b\u2211 ( - \u03b9_v) + f\u2208\u039b\u2211 (  - ^1_f),\n\nwhere \u03b9\u2208\u011c is the constant character \u03b9(g) = 1, 1\u2208 G is the neutral element, and v\u2208\u039b means that {e\u2208:v\u2208\u2202 e}\u2282\u039b, and similarly for f\u2208\u039b. This choice of boundary condition is arbitrary and made only for simplicity here; it will not play a role in the following discussion.\n\nIn fact, we shall be interested in the infinite-volume limit of the model. We recall some elementary properties of the model exhibited in the original\u00a0<cit.>, and refer to\u00a0<cit.> for a complete set of proofs. The sum\u00a0(<ref>) is not convergent in norm, but it remains meaningful as the generator of the dynamics: for any local observable A, the limit\n\n\n    \u03b4^0(A) = lim_\u039b\u2192^2[H^0,A]\n\n\nexists for all A\u2208_loc and extends to a densely defined unbounded *-derivation on . In this infinite volume limit, the model has a unique translation-invariant ground state \u03c9_0 which is frustration-free and gapped \u2013 we shall henceforth call it the vacuum state. \u03c9_0 is a ground state in the sense of being a positive normalized functional on  such that\n\n\n    -\u03c9_0(A\u03b4^0(A))\u22650\n\n\nfor all A\u2208_loc. That it is gapped means that there is g>0 such that \n\n\n    -\u03c9_0(A\u03b4^0(A))\u2265 g\u03c9_0(A A)\n\n\nfor all A\u2208_loc such that \u03c9_0(A) = 0. Specifically, g=1 here. Finally, the frustration-freeness is expressed  by\n\n\n    \u03c9_0(\u03b9_v)=1,    \u03c9_0(^1_f) = 1,\n\n\nfor all v\u2208,f\u2208. \n\nAdditional properties of the vacuum state are that \u03c9_0(\u03c7_v)=0=\u03c9_0(^g_f) for all non-trivial elements of G (respectively \u011c) from which we deduce that\n\n\n    \u03c9_0([_v^\u03c7,A])=0,    \u03c9_0([_f^g,A])=0,\n\n\nfor all A\u2208 by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nLet us briefly come back to the string operators introduced above. They satisfy the following commutation relations:\n\n\n    \u03c7_\u2202_0 \u03b3\u03be\u03b3 = \u03be\u03b3\u03c7\u03be\u0305_\u2202_0 \u03b3,     \u03c7_\u2202_1 \u03b3\u03be\u03b3 = \u03be\u03b3\u03c7\u03be_\u2202_1 \u03b3, \n       ^h_\u2202_0 \u03b3g\u03b3 = g\u03b3^hg_\u2202_0 \u03b3,\n        ^h_\u2202_1 \u03b3g\u03b3 =  g\u03b3^hg_\u2202_1 \u03b3,\n\n\nwhere we used that \u03c7(g\u0305) = \u03c7(g) = \u03c7(g). Moreover, \u03c7_v commutes with \u03be\u03b3 for v \u2209\u2202\u03b3 and ^h_f commutes with g\u03b3 for f \u2209\u2202\u03b3. We further note that any (dual) string operators commute with all 's and all 's. We shall also need commutation relations between string operators of different types:\n\n\n    _\u03b3^\u03c7_\u03b3^g = (\u03c7(g))^c(\u03b3,\u03b3)_\u03b3^g _\u03b3^\u03c7\n\n\nHere, c(\u03b3,\u03b3) is the number of signed crossings of the two strings: each crossing, from right to left, of \u03b3 and \u03b3 yields a factor \u03c7(g); since a change in the orientation of a string amounts to the exchange of the charge with its inverse, a crossing from left to right yields \u03c7(g) = \u03c7(g).  \n \n\nLocalized excitations above the ground state are simple to characterize. These quasi-particles arise from the violation of the conditions\u00a0(<ref>). Indeed, we shall say that a state \u03c9 carries an electric charge at vertex v if \u03c9(\u03b9_v) = 0, or a magnetic flux through face f if \u03c9_0(^1_f) = 0. The commutation relations\u00a0(<ref>) yield that\n\n\n    \u03c9_0((F_\u03b3^\u03c7) A_\u2202_0\u03b3^\u03be F_\u03b3^\u03c7)=\u03b4_\u03be,\u03c7,    \u03c9_0((F_\u03b3^\u03c7) A_\u2202_1\u03b3^\u03be F_\u03b3^\u03c7)=\u03b4_\u03be,\u03c7,\n\n\nso that it is natural to interpret the string operator ^\u03be_\u03b3 as creating a pair of quasi-particles with opposite electric charges (\u03c7,\u03c7) at either ends of \u03b3, while ^g_\u03b3 creates a pair of fluxes (g,g\u0305) on the two extremal faces of \u03b3. This is consistent with the fact that if \u03b3_1,\u03b3_2 are such that \u2202_1\u03b3_1 = \u2202_0\u03b3_2, then ^\u03be_\u03b3_1^\u03be_\u03b3_2 = ^\u03be_\u03b3_1\u00b7\u03b3_2, where \u03b3_1\u00b7\u03b3_2 denotes the concatenation of two strings.\n\nSince this Hamiltonian is a sum of strictly local commuting terms, we have that\n\n\n    \u03b4^0(\u03c7_v) = 0 = \u03b4^0(^g_f),\n\n\nfor all \u03c7\u2208\u011c and g\u2208 G, showing that excitations are not dynamical. We shall in the next section introduce hopping terms for these quasi-particles which will define a dynamical version of the QDM. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The dynamical quantum double model\n\n\nHopping of electric charges between two vertices along an edge e\u2208 will be induced by the following operator\n\n\n    T_e^\u03f5 = \u2211_\u03c7\u2208\u011c,\u03c7\u2260\u03b9(\n    \u2131^\u03c7_(v,e)\u03b9_v'\u03c7_v + \u2131^\u03c7_(v',e)\u03b9_v\u03c7_v')\n\n\nwhere the edge e is between v and v'. Since (\u2131^\u03c7_(v,e)) = \u2131^\u03c7_(v,e)=\u2131^\u03c7_(v',e), the second term is the adjoint of the first one and hence T_e^\u03f5 is self-adjoint. Flux hopping between two faces across e\u2208 can be defined similarly,\n\n\n    T_e^\u03bc = \u2211_h\u2208 G,h\u2260 1(\n    \u2131^h_(f,e)^1_f'^h_f + \u2131^h\u0305_(f',e)^1_f^h_f')\n\n\nwhere the edge e is shared by f and f'.\n\nFinally, and in accordance with the fact that a flux-charge pair can be considered a particle of its own type, we also introduce a hopping such a pair:\n\n\n    T_e^\u03f5\u03bc = \u2211_h\u2208 G,h\u2260 1 \n    \u03c7\u2208\u011c,\u03c7\u2260\u03b9{   (\n    \u2131^\u03c7_(v,e)\u03b9_v'\u03c7_v +  \u2131^\u03c7_(v',e)\u03b9_v\u03c7_v')(_f^h + _f'^h) \n    \n       + (\n    \u2131^h\u0305_(f,e)^1_f'^h_f + \u2131^h\u0305_(f',e)^1_f^h_f')(_v^\u03c7 + _v'^\u03c7)\n    }\n\n\nwhere e,v,v',f,f' are illustrated in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\nWith these definitions, we define the full Hamiltonian of the model by\n\n\n    H = H^0 + \u03bb_\u03f5 H^\u03f5 + \u03bb_\u03bc H^\u03bc + \u03bb_\u03f5\u03bc H^\u03f5\u03bc,\n\n\nwhere H^\u266f = \u2211_e\u2208 T^\u266f_e, with \u266f stands for \u03f5, \u03bc or \u03f5\u03bc, and the sum is interpreted as in\u00a0(<ref>). We denote\n\n\n    \u03b4 = lim_\u039b\u2192^2[H_\u039b,\u00b7] = \u03b4^0+\u03b4^\u03f5+\u03b4^\u03bc+\u03b4^\u03f5\u03bc,\n\n\nthe generator of the dynamics in the infinite volume limit, while \u03b4^\u266f are the derivations associated with H^\u266f. The corresponding dynamics is denoted \u03c4_t, respectively \u03c4_t^\u266f. \n\nThe following proposition justifies the nomenclature that has been used thus far in describing the various terms of the Hamiltonian. The first part\u00a0(<ref>) is a continuity equation for the charge \u03b6\u2208\u011c and it should be contrasted with\u00a0(<ref>). The operator _\u039b^\u03b6 has the natural interpretation of the total charge of type \u03b6 in the volume \u039b. The second part of the proposition shows that the hopping terms are gauge invariant. \n\n\nLet \u03b6\u2208\u011c, \u03b6\u2260\u03b9, and let \u039b be a finite subset of . Let _\u039b^\u03b6 = \u2211_v\u2208\u039b^\u03b6_v. \n\n(i) Let ^\u03b6_(v,e) = (^\u03b6\u0305_(v,e)^\u03b9_v'^\u03b6_v - ^\u03b6\u0305_(v',e)^\u03b9_v^\u03b6_v'). Then\n\n\n    \u03b4^\u03f5(^\u03b6_\u039b) = \u2211_(v,e)\u2208\u2202\u039b^\u03b6_(v,e),\n\n\nwhere (v,e)\u2208\u2202\u039b if \u2202 e\u2229\u039b\u2260\u2205 and \u2202 e\u2229\u039b^c \u2260\u2205. Moreover, \u03b4^\u03bc(^\u03b6_\u039b) = 0. \n\n(ii) For any edge e\u2208, \n\n\n    \u2211_v\u2208[T_e^\u03f5, ^\u03b6_v] = 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe operators T_e^\u03f5 and ^\u03b6_v do not commute only if v is one of the vertices at the boundary of e, in which case as short calculation yields\n\n\n    [T_e^\u03f5, ^\u03b6_v]    = \u2211_\u03c7\u2208\u011c([^\u03c7_(v,e),^\u03b6_v] ^\u03b9_v'^\u03c7_v + \n    [^\u03c7_(v',e),^\u03b6_v] ^\u03b9_v^\u03c7_v') \n       = \u2211_\u03c7\u2208\u011c(^\u03c7_(v,e)(^\u03b6_v - ^\u03b6\u03c7_v)^\u03b9_v'^\u03c7_v\n    + ^\u03c7_(v',e)(^\u03b6_v - ^\u03b6\u03c7_v)^\u03b9_v^\u03c7_v').\n\n\nWith\u00a0(<ref>) and since \u03b6\u2260\u03b9, we have that ^\u03b6\u03c7_v^\u03c7_v = 0 as well as ^\u03b6_v^\u03b9_v=0, and this further imposes that \u03c7 = \u03b6 in both remaining terms, namely [T_e^\u03f5, ^\u03b6_v] = ^\u03b6_(v,e). Claim (ii) immediately follows since [T_e^\u03f5, \u2211_v^\u03b6_v] = ^\u03b6_(v_1,e) + ^\u03b6_(v_2,e) = 0 by the antisymmetry of ^\u03b6_(v,e) under the exchange of the vertices. Claim (i) follows similarly: By the same argument, the contribution from all edges that are internal to \u039b vanish, the only remaining ones being those on the boundary. Finally, \u03b4^\u03bc(^\u03b6_\u039b) = 0 follows from the fact that both 's and dual strings are products of  operators, which are all mutually commuting. \n\n\nWe conclude this section by pointing out that a natural extension of the Hamiltonian above would be to introduce an external `vector potential' by twisting the various hopping term, as for example\n\n\n    -\u03b2_e\u2131^\u03c7_(v,e)\u03b9_v'\u03c7_v + \u03b2_e\u2131^\u03c7_(v',e)\u03b9_v\u03c7_v'.\n\n\nAn edge-dependent \u03b2:\u2192 would allow one to add external `fluxes' through plaquettes. Of course, similar variations are possible with the other hopping terms. As we shall see shortly, such a flux attachment that is typical of anyons will appear intrinsically as soon as pairs of particles are present in the system.  \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Superselection sectors and anyons\n\n\nRecall that the state \u03c9_0 is the unique translation invariant ground state. We briefly discussed above the states \u03c9_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7 where \u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7 = _\u03b3^\u03c7(\u00b7)_\u03b3^\u03c7 creates a pair of excitations (\u03c7,\u03c7) localized at the ends of the string on top of the existing vacuum. \n\nIf \u03b3 = {(v_i,e_i):i\u2208} is an infinite string, the operator _\u03b3^\u03c7 is not well-defined, but the corresponding automorphism \u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7 exists. Indeed, let \u03b3^(N) = {(v_i,e_i):i=1,\u2026,N} be its truncation to the first N edges. For any A\u2208_loc, the limit\n\n\n    \u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3(A) = lim_N\u2192\u221e_\u03b3^(N)^\u03c7 A _\u03b3^(N)^\u03c7\n\n\nexists since the sequence of operators on the right hand side is eventually constant, and \u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7 extends to an automorphism of  since \u2016\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7(A)\u2016 = \u2016 A\u2016. In particular, the linear functional \u03c9_0\u2218\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3 defines a state on , which we shall refer to as a charged state. It is so that \n\n\n    (\u03c9_0\u2218\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3)(_v^\u03b9) = \n    0    if v=\u2202_0\u03b3\n     1    otherwise  and   (\u03c9_0\u2218\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3)(_f^1) = 1  for all f\u2208.\n\n\nNow, if \u03bb is a (finite) closed loop, namely \u2202_0\u03bb = \u2202_1\u03bb, then the action of F_\u03bb^\u03c7 is trivial on the vacuum state, namely\n\n\n    \u03c9_0(_\u03bb^\u03c7 A _\u03bb^\u03c7) = \u03c9_0(A)    (\u03bb closed)\n\n\nfor all A\u2208. This, and the composition property of string operators implies that \n\n\n    \u03c9_0\u2218\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3 = \u03c9_0\u2218\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3\u0303\n\n\nfor all strings \u03b3 such that \u2202\u03b3 = \u2202\u03b3\u0303. If \u03b3 is an infinite string, this shows that the state \u03c9_0\u2218\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3 depends only on the position of the initial vertex v = \u2202_0\u03b3, which justifies the notation \u03c9_v^\u03c7. Physically, the state \u03c9_v^\u03c7 is a state carrying one electric charge \u03c7 at the vertex v and remains indistinguishable from the vacuum state everywhere else. It can be shown (<cit.>,<cit.>) that \u03c9_v^\u03c7 is a ground state in the sense of\u00a0(<ref>) for any \u03c7\u2208\u011c and any v\u2208.\n\nLet (_0,\u03c0_0,\u03a9_0) be the GNS representation of the vacuum state \u2014 we shall henceforth refer to it as the vacuum representation. \nFor a given state, all GNS representations are unitarily equivalent.\nA charged state \u03c9_v^\u03c7 is not equivalent to \u03c9_0. Its GNS representation can be given by (_0,\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7,\u03a9_0), where \u2202_0\u03b3 = v:\n\n\n    \u03c9_v^\u03c7(A) = \u27e8\u03a9_0|(\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7)(A) \u03a9_0\u27e9 = \u03c9_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7(A).\n\n\n Similarly, if \u03c7\u2260\u03be, then \u03c9_v^\u03c7 and \u03c9_v^\u03be are inequivalent.\n\n\nWhile the state \u03c9_v^\u03c7 depends only on the endpoint v of the string \u03b3, the GNS representation does depend on the entire string \u03b3. The uniqueness of the GNS representation implies that for any two strings \u03b3_1,\u03b3_2 starting at v, the representations \u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3_1^\u03c7,\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3_2^\u03c7 are equivalent: this is very reminiscent of the freedom of choice of the flux line needed to introduce a flux piercing the plane in a 2d electron gas. We shall make a choice which will be convenient for the rest of the discussion: The string associated with the state \u03c9_v^\u03c7 is taken to be extending vertically down from the vertex\u00a0v, as illustrated in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\nThe construction just discussed can be carried out with dual strings to yield charged ground states of the form \u03c9_f^g = \u03c9_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^g, and we pick those strings to be oriented vertically upwards from the face f.\n\n\n\nA superselection sector of \u03b4^0 is a class of unitarily equivalent \u03b4^0-ground state representations. The above discussion shows that group elements and characters label superselection sectors. We claim furthermore that states carrying the same charge but located at different vertices are equivalent. Indeed, the composition property of the string operators implies that two states \u03c9_v^\u03c7 and \u03c9_v'^\u03c7 are related by\n\n\n    \u03c9_v'^\u03c7(A) = \u03c9_v^\u03c7(^\u03c7_\u03b3(v'\u2192 v) A ^\u03c7_\u03b3(v'\u2192 v)),\n\n\nwhere \u03b3(v'\u2192 v) is any string such that \u2202_0\u03b3(v'\u2192 v) = v' and \u2202_1\u03b3(v'\u2192 v) = v. The operator ^\u03c7_\u03b3(v\u2192 v') is a unitary element of the algebra, so that the two states are indeed unitarily equivalent. That these are all possible sectors is the following result of\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n\nThe complete set of superselection sectors of \u03b4^0 is labelled by elements of G\u00d7\u011c. \n\n\n\nAs was already pointed out in the original paper <cit.>, the quasi-particles associated with each superselection sector are Abelian anyons. In the present language, this can be made precise in the sense of the DHR analysis\u00a0<cit.>, see again\u00a0<cit.>. While the anyonic nature of particles has a general abstract treatment in terms of the superselection sectors, see\u00a0<cit.>, or\u00a0<cit.> for the quantum double models, we can understand braiding here in the sense of parallel transport, close to the original description of Leinaas and Myrheim, namely by starting with the two-particle representation (_0,\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^g\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7,\u03a9_0), and continuously braiding the electric charge \u03c7 around the flux g. For this, let \u03bb be a closed string of length N such that \u2202_0\u03bb = \u2202_1\u03bb = \u2202_0\u03b3. Let \u03a8_\u03bb(t)\u2208_0 be defined by \u03a8_\u03bb(0) = \u03a9_0 and \u03a8_\u03bb(t) = F^\u03c7_\u03bb(t) \u03a9_0, where F^\u03c7_\u03bb(t) is given by\n\n\n    F^\u03c7_\u03bb(t) = (\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^g\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7) (\u220f_j=0^N( + f(t - j)(\u2131^\u03c7_(v_N-j,e_N-j) - ))),    (t>0).\n\n\nHere, f is a smooth switch function such that f(t) = 0 if t\u22640 and f(t) = 1 if t\u22651. At integer time steps t=k with 1\u2264 k\u2264 N, we have that \n\n\n    \u03a8_\u03bb(k) = (\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^g\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7) (\u220f_j=0^k-1\u2131^\u03c7_(v_N-j,e_N-j))\u03a9_0,\n\n\nand \u03a8_\u03bb(t) = (\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^g\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7) (\u2131^\u03c7_\u03bb) \u03a9_0 for all t\u2265 N. It is now immediate to compute the holonomy associated with \u03bb and note that it is quantized.\n\n\nLet \u03b7_\u03bb = \u27e8\u03a9_0|\u03a8_\u03bb(N)\u27e9. Then\n\n\n    \u03b7_\u03bb = \u03c7(g)^w_\u2202_0\u03b3(\u03bb),\n\n\nwhere w_\u2202_0\u03b3(\u03bb) is the winding number of the string \u03bb around the face \u2202_0\u03b3.\n\n\n\nThe commutation relation\u00a0(<ref>) implies that\n\n\n    (\u0393_\u03b3^g\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7)(\u2131^\u03c7_\u03bb) \n    = \u0393_\u03b3^g(\u2131^\u03c7_\u03bb) = \u03c7(g)^w_\u2202_0\u03b3(\u03bb)\u2131^\u03c7_\u03bb\n\n\nwhich yields immediately \u03b7_\u03bb = \u03c7(g)^w_\u2202_0\u03b3(\u03bb)\u27e8\u03a9_0,\u03c0_0(\u2131^\u03c7_\u03bb)\u03a9_0\u27e9 = \u03c7(g)^w_\u2202_0\u03b3(\u03bb) since \u03bb is a closed string, see\u00a0(<ref>). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Symmetries\n \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Charge conservation\n\n\nFor any \u03c7\u2208\u011c, let \u03b4^\u03c7 be the *-derivation on  formally given by \u2211_v[^\u03c7_v,\u00b7]. Similarly, for any g\u2208 G, let \u03b4^g be the *-derivation given by \u2211_f[_f^g,\u00b7]. Let \u03b1^\u03c7_s, respectively \u03b2^g_s be the corresponding groups of automorphisms. A slight extension of the proof of Proposition\u00a0<ref> yields the following proposition:\n\n\nFor all \u03c7\u2208\u011c and all g\u2208 G,\n\n\n    \u03b1^\u03c7_s \u2218\u03c4_t = \u03c4_t\u2218\u03b1^\u03c7_s,    \u03b2^g_s\u2218\u03c4_t = \u03c4_t\u2218\u03b2^g_s,\n\n\nfor all s,t\u2208.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Charge conjugations\n\n\nThere are two types of conjugations in these models, corresponding to a flux-anti flux exchange or a charge-anti charge exchange. We first define an antilinear transformation \u03b8^\u03bc on  by\n\n\n    \u03b8^\u03bc| g\u27e9 = |g\u0305\u27e9,\n\n\nand extension by antilinearity, for which (\u03b8^\u03bc)^2 =. It is immediate to check that\n\n\n    \u03b8^\u03bc L^g = L^g\u0305\u03b8^\u03bc,    \u03b8^\u03bc T^\u03c7 = T^\u03c7\u03b8^\u03bc,\n\n\nfor all g\u2208 G,\u03c7\u2208\u011c. The automorphism\n\n\n    \u0398^\u03bc(\u00b7) = lim_\u039b\u2192^2\u0398^\u03bc_\u039b(\u00b7)\u0398^\u03bc_\u039b,\n\n\nwhere \u0398^\u03bc_\u039b = \u2297_e\u2208_\u039b\u03b8_e, acts as\n\n\n    \u0398^\u03bc(_v^\u03c7) = _v^\u03c7,    \u0398^\u03bc(^h) = ^h\u0305.\n\n\n\n\nA second antiunitary on  is given by complex conjugation, namely\n\n\n    \u03b8^\u03f5| g\u27e9 = | g\u27e9,\n\n\nand extension by antilinearity. It again squares to the identity but\n\n\n    \u03b8^\u03f5 L^g = L^g\u03b8^\u03f5,    \u03b8^\u03f5 T^\u03c7 = T^\u03c7\u03b8^\u03f5,\n\n\nfor all g\u2208 G,\u03c7\u2208\u011c. It follows that\n\n\n    \u0398^\u03f5( _v^\u03c7 ) = _v^\u03c7,    \u0398^\u03f5( ^h ) = ^h,\n\n\nwhere \u0398^\u03f5 is the automorphism of  associated with the local \u03b8^\u03f5.\n\n\n\nFor all \u03c7\u2208\u011c and all g\u2208 G,\n\n\n    \u0398^\u266f\u2218\u03c4_t = \u03c4_-t\u2218\u0398^\u266f,\n\n\nwhere \u266f\u2208{\u03f5,\u03bc}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Duality\n\n\nThe Abelian quantum double models exhibit a duality symmetry that corresponds to the exchange of fluxes with charges. Using the Fourier transform associated with the finite Abelian group G, and the fact that G and \u011c are isomorphic as \nAbelian groups, we can define a duality transformation U on the edge Hilbert space . For clarity we recall the standard definitions. \nSince \u2245\u2113^2(G)\u2245\u2113^2(\u011c), and using the orthogonality relation for characters, we can introduce an orthogonal \nbasis {|\u03c7\u27e9|\u03c7\u2208\u011c}, labelled by the characters, by requiring \u27e8\u03c7|\u03be\u27e9=\u03c7(g). The conventional normalization \nthen gives:\n\n    \u27e8\u03c7|\u03be\u27e9=|G| \u03b4_\u03c7,\u03be,   \u03c7,\u03be\u2208\u011c.\n\nThe two bases {|g\u27e9: g\u2208 G} and {|\u03c7\u27e9: \u03c7\u2208\u011c} give rise to a unitary transformation U on =\u2113^2(G) such that \n\n    v\u0302 = Uv, v\u0302(\u03c7) = | G|^-1/2\u2211_g\u2208 G\u03c7(g) v(g).\n\nand with the inverse given by\n\n    v(g) = | G|^-1/2\u2211_\u03c7\u2208\u011c\u03c7(g) v\u0302(\u03c7).\n\nAs operators on \u2113^2(G), L^h and T^\u03c7 take the form\n\n    (L^h v)(g) = v(h\u0305 g),    (T^\u03c7 v)(g) = \u03c7(g)v(g).\n\nThe Fourier transform interchanges their actions on \u2113^2(\u011c) (up to a complex conjugate)\n\n    U L^h U^* v\u0302 (\u03be) = \u03be(h) v\u0302 (\u03be),    U T^\u03c7 U^* v\u0302 (\u03be) = v\u0302 (\u03c7\u03be).\n\nIt follows that the transformed Hamiltonian (\u2297 U) H (\u2297 U^*) is identical to H upon the replacement of G by \u011c and the lattice by its dual lattice, and after interchanging \u03bb_\u03f5 \nand \u03bb_\u03bc.\n \nNote that in the cyclic case G=_N, with the characters labelled by m=0,\u2026,N-1, \u03c7_m: j\u21a6\u03c9^mj, with \u03c9=e^2\u03c0 i/N, U is the usual finite Fourier transform:\n\n\n    U| j\u27e9 = 1/\u221a(N)\u2211_k=0^N-1\u03c9^jk| k\u27e9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Dynamics in Hilbert space\n\n\nThe vacuum state remains invariant under the full dynamics \u03c4_t since \u03c9_0\u2218\u03b4 = \u03c9_0. It follows that\n\u03c4_t is unitarily implementable in the vacuum representation, namely there is a strongly continuous unitary group t\u21a6 U_0,t on _0 such that\n\n\n    U_0,t\u03c0_0(A)(U_0,t) = \u03c0_0(\u03c4_t(A)),     U_0,t\u03a9_0 = \u03a9_0.\n\n\nLet K_0 be its self-adjoint generator, normalized so that K_0\u03a9_0=0:\n\n\n    [K_0,\u03c0_0(A)] = \u03c0_0(\u03b4(A)).\n\n\n\nWhile the charged states were also invariant under \u03b4^0, this is not the case anymore in the presence of the hopping terms. However, the dynamics is still unitarily implementable in the charged representations. We start with the charged state having one electric charge \u03c7. \n\n\n\nThe dynamics \u03c4_t is unitarily implementable in the GNS representation of \u03c9_v^\u03c7: There is a strongly continuous unitary group t\u21a6 U_\u03b3,t^\u03c7 on _0 such that\n\n\n    U_\u03b3,t^\u03c7(\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7)(A)(U_\u03b3,t^\u03c7) = (\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7)(\u03c4_t(A)),\n\n\nfor all A\u2208.\n\n\n\nSince the automorphism \u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3 is strictly local, in the sense that \u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3(_\u039b)\u2282_\u039b for any \u039b\u2282, its action on any Hamiltonian is naturally  defined by letting \u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3 act on every interaction term. Denoting the resulting Hamiltonian \u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3(H) and the corresponding derivation \u03b4^\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3(H), we have that\n\n\n    \u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3\u2218\u03b4 = \u03b4^\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3(H)\u2218\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3.\n\n\nA short calculation yields that\n\n\n    \u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7(H^0) = H^0 + (^\u03b9_\u2202_0\u03b3 - ^\u03c7_\u2202_0\u03b3)\n\n\nand\n\n\n    \u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7(H^\u03f5) = H^\u03f5 + \u2211_e\u2208: \n    \u2202 e = {\u2202_0\u03b3,v}\u2211_\u03be\u2208\u011c,\u03be\u2260\u03b9(^\u03be_(\u2202_0\u03b3,e)^\u03b9_v(^\u03c7\u03be_\u2202_0\u03b3 - ^\u03be_\u2202_0\u03b3)\n    + ^\u03be_(v,e)(^\u03c7_\u2202_0\u03b3 - ^\u03b9_\u2202_0\u03b3)^\u03be_v).\n\n\nThe action of \u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7 on H^\u03bc is trivial, up to the phase picked by all hopping terms across \u03b3, see\u00a0(<ref>), resulting in\n\n\n    \u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7(H^\u03bc) = H^\u03bc + \u2211_e\u2208\u03b3\u2211_h\u2208 G,h\u2260 1(\n    (\u03c7(h)^c(\u03b3,(f,e))-1) \u2131^h_(f,e)^1_f'^h_f + (\u03c7(h)^c(\u03b3,(f',e))-1)\u2131^h\u0305_(f',e)^1_f^h_f').\n\n\nFinally, we consider the action of \u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7 on H^\u03f5\u03bc. The charge hopping corresponding to the first line of\u00a0(<ref>) is affected as in\u00a0(<ref>) since  operators are left invariant. The flux hopping corresponding to the second line of\u00a0(<ref>) if affected in two ways: Firstly as in\u00a0(<ref>), the hopping terms across the string \u03b3 pick up a phase, and secondly the projectors _\u2202_0\u03b3^\u03be are mapped to _\u2202_0\u03b3^\u03be\u03c7. \n\nBy\u00a0(<ref>), all terms that contain an ^\u03c7 for \u03c7\u2260\u03b9 or a ^g for g\u2260 1 leave the vacuum state invariant. The same holds for H^0, and we gather the action of all of them under the notation \u03b4^\u03c7_\u03b3,0. The only terms that have a non-trivial action on \u03c9_0 are supported in a finite neighbourhood of \u2202_0\u03b3 and given explicitly by\n\n\n    P^\u03c7_\u2202_0\u03b3 = ^\u03b9_\u2202_0\u03b3\n    + \u2211_e\u2208: \n    \u2202 e = {\u2202_0\u03b3,v}^\u03c7_(\u2202_0\u03b3,e)^\u03b9_v^\u03b9_\u2202_0\u03b3\u2208_loc.\n\n\nSummarizing, we have that\n\n\n    \u03b4^\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3(H) = \u03b4^\u03c7_\u03b3,0+[P^\u03c7_\u2202_0\u03b3,\u00b7],\n\n\nand \u03c9_0 is invariant under the action of\u00a0\u03b4^\u03c7_\u03b3,0. We conclude as in\u00a0(<ref>) that \u03b4^\u03c7_\u03b3,0 is implemented by a self-adjoint operator K_\u03b3,0^\u03c7 and so\n\n\n    \u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7\u2218\u03b4(A) = [K_\u03b3,0^\u03c7 + \u03c0_0(P^\u03c7_\u2202_0\u03b3),\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7(A)]     K_\u03b3,0^\u03c7\u03a9_0 = 0.\n\n\nHence, U_\u03b3,t^\u03c7 =  t K_\u03b3^\u03c7 where K_\u03b3^\u03c7 = K_\u03b3,0^\u03c7 + \u03c0_0(P^\u03c7_\u2202_0\u03b3).\n\n\n\nThe Hamiltonian K^\u03c7_\u03b3 \u2014 and its cousins to be described shortly \u2014 will be the main object of the spectral analysis carried out in the next section. Before doing this, we recall that, in the representation \u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7, the vector \u03a9_0 corresponds to the state having one electric charge \u03c7 at \u2202_0\u03b3. That this charge is dynamical is reflected in the fact that the propagator has a non-trivial action on \u03a9_0 since \n\n\n    K^\u03c7_\u03b3\u03a9_0 = \u03c0_0(P^\u03c7_\u2202_0\u03b3) \u03a9_0\n    =\u03a9_0 + \u03bb_\u03f5\u2211_e:\u2202_0\u03b3\u2208\u2202 e\u03c0_0(^\u03c7_(\u2202_0\u03b3,e)) \u03a9_0,\n\n\nwhere we used that \u03c0_0(^\u03b9_v)\u03a9_0 = \u03a9_0 for all v\u2208.\n\nThe results above extend with the obvious modifications to the case of a magnetic charge localized on a face. The case of both an electric charge \u03c7\u2208\u011c at vertex v and a magnetic flux g\u2208 G at face f is similar but requires a little more attention. The GNS representation of the state \u03c9^\u03c7,g_v,f is given by (\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393^g_\u03b3\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7,_0,\u03a9_0), where \u2202_0\u03b3 = v and \u2202_0\u03b3= f, as in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We denote K^\u03c7,g_\u03b3,\u03b3 the generator of the dynamics in the GNS representation. It is of the same form as\u00a0(<ref>), namely\n\n\n    K^\u03c7,g_\u03b3,\u03b3 = K^\u03c7,g_\u03b3,\u03b3,0 + \u03c0_0(P^\u03c7,g_v,f),\n         K^\u03c7,g_\u03b3,\u03b3,0\u03a9_0 = 0,\n\n\nwhere P^\u03c7,g_v,f is again strictly local. The action of \u0393_\u03b3^g on\u00a0(<ref>) is simple,\n\n\n    (\u0393^g_\u03b3\u2218\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3)(H^0)-H^0 =\n    (^\u03b9_\u2202_0\u03b3 - ^\u03c7_\u2202_0\u03b3)\n    +(_\u2202_0\u03b3^1 - _\u2202_0\u03b3^g),\n\n\nproviding (^\u03b9_\u2202_0\u03b3 + _\u2202_0\u03b3^1) to P^\u03c7,g_v,f. Secondly, \u0393_\u03b3^g adds phases to the hopping terms of\u00a0(<ref>) that cross \u03b3 with only \n\n\n    \u2211_e\u2208: \n     e = \u27e8\u2202_0\u03b3,v\u27e9\u03c7(g)^-c((\u2202_0\u03b3,e),\u03b3)^\u03c7_(\u2202_0\u03b3,e)^\u03b9_v^\u03b9_\u2202_0\u03b3\n\n\nnot leaving \u03c9_0 invariant. Furthermore, the only non-trivial action of \u0393_\u03b3^g on \u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7(H^\u03bc) given in\u00a0(<ref>) is at the end of the dual string \u2202_0\u03b3, which adds\n\n\n    \u2211_e\u2208: \n     e \u2208\u2202\u2202_0\u03b3\u2229\u2202 f\u03c7(g)^c(\u03b3,(\u2202_0\u03b3,e))^g_(\u2202_0\u03b3,e)^1_f^1_\u2202_0\u03b3.\n\n\nto P^\u03c7,g_v,f.\nFinally, (\u0393^g_\u03b3\u2218\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3)(H^\u03f5\u03bc) acts that act non-trivially on \u03c9_0 if and only if \u2202_0\u03b3, \u2202_0\u03b3 belong to the same site, namely \u2202_0\u03b3\u2208\u2202_0\u03b3. In that case, there are four different possible hopping terms of either form above, as illustrated in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, the see that in a two-particle state, the \u03c7 particle exhibits nearest neighbour hopping on the set of vertices, the g particle exhibits nearest neighbour hopping on the set of faces, and the hopping of the composite particle is to the neighbouring sites. The hopping of each type of single particle is influenced by the presence of the other type in its immediate vicinity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS IN THE ONE-PARTICLE SECTORS\n   \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The Hamiltonian in one- and two-particle subspaces\n\n\nWe introduced in Section\u00a0<ref> the derivations corresponding to the number operators. In the GNS representations discussed above, the derivation is implemented by the commutator with a self-adjoint operator, analogous to the number operator on Fock space. Let us first recall the definition of\u00a0^\u03b6_\u039b in Proposition\u00a0<ref>. We define\n\n\n    ^\u011c_\u039b = \u2211_\u03b6\u2208\u011c^\u03b6_\u039b\u2208.\n\n\nIf \u2202_0\u03b3\u2208\u039b, then\n\n\n    \u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7(^\u011c_\u039b) = ^\u011c_\u039b + (^\u03b9_\u2202_0\u03b3 - ^\u03c7_\u2202_0\u03b3).\n\n\nIn the vacuum representation, the limit\n\n\n    N_0^\u011c = _\u039b\u2192\u03c0_0(^\u011c_\u039b)\n\n\ndefines an unbounded self-adjoint operator with a dense domain for which N_0^\u011c\u03a9_0 = 0. It follows that the derivation lim_\u039b\u2192[_\u039b^\u011c,\u00b7] is implemented in the GNS space of \u03c9_\u2202_0\u03b3^\u03c7 by\n\n\n    N^\u011c = N_0^\u011c + \u03c0_0(A^\u03b9_\u2202_0\u03b3 - A^\u03c7_\u2202_0\u03b3).\n\n\nIn particular, N^\u011c\u03a9_0 = \u03c0_0(A^\u03b9_\u2202_0\u03b3)\u03a9_0 = \u03a9_0. Had we not summed over \u011c, the same sequence of ideas would have given a generator N^\u03b6 for any \u03b6\u2208\u011c with the property that N^\u03b6\u03a9_0 = \u03b4_\u03b6,\u03c7\u03a9_0. \n\n\nReplacing ^\u03c7's by ^g's, we obtain a second number operator denoted N^ G and such that N^ G\u03a9_0=0. Finally,\n\n\n    N = N^\u011c + N^ G\n\n\nis the total number operator. \n\nTwo charged states differing only by the position of the particle are unitarily equivalent and the intertwiner of representations is explicit. (<ref>) shows that if T_v\u2192 v' = \u03c0_0(^\u03c7_\u03b3(v'\u2192 v)), then T_v\u2192 v' (\u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_v^\u03c7)(A) T_v\u2192 v' provides a GNS representation of \u03c9_v'^\u03c7 on _0. The corresponding string does however not satisfy the gauge fixing condition. As shown in\u00a0<cit.>, this can be remedied by introducing an additional unitary intertwiner V^\u03c7 which is explicitly given as a limit, in the weak operator topology, of operators corresponding to closed strings. In particular, V^\u03c7\u03a9_0 = \u03a9_0. Precisely,\n\n\n    \u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3'(A) = lim_n\u2192\u221e(_v,v',n^\u03c7) (^\u03c7_\u03b3(v'\u2192 v))\u0393^\u03c7_\u03b3(A)\n    ^\u03c7_\u03b3(v'\u2192 v)_v,v',n^\u03c7\n\n\nfor all A\u2208_loc, and \u03c9_0((_v,v',n^\u03c7) A _v,v',n^\u03c7) = \u03c9_0 as well as V ^\u03c7= _n\u2192\u221e\u03c0_0(_v,v',n^\u03c7), where _v,v',n^\u03c7 are illustrated in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We conclude that\n\n\n    (_0, \u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7, T_v\u2192 v'\u03a9_0)\n\n\nis a GNS representation of \u03c9_v'^\u03c7, with the gauge fixed as prescribed. \n\n\n\nFor notational clarity and simplicity, we denote the vectors T_v\u2192 v'\u03a9_0 of _0 in the representation \u03c0_0\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7 by {|\u03c7,v'\u27e9:v'\u2208} and let _\u03c7\u2282_0 be the space they span; in particular, \u03a9_0 = |\u03c7,v\u27e9. They satisfy \n\n\n    N|\u03c7,v\u27e9 = |\u03c7,v\u27e9\n\n\nfor all v\u2208 and we refer to them as one-particle states. The vector |\u03c7,v\u27e9 corresponds to a state having exactly one charge \u03c7 localized at vertex v. The same holds for the dual picture, yielding one-particle vectors {| g,f'\u27e9:f'\u2208} of _0 in the representation \u03c0_0\u2218\u0393^g_\u03b3, for any g\u2208 G.\n\nFinally, in the GNS space of the states \u03c9^\u03c7,g_v,f, the corresponding vectors {| (\u03c7,v), (g,f)\u27e9:v\u2208,f\u2208} are such that N| (\u03c7,v), (g,f)\u27e9 = 2| (\u03c7,v), (g,f)\u27e9 and we refer to their span _\u03c7,g\u2282_0 as a two-particle subspace. In fact, _\u03c7,g is completely characterized by \n\n\n    \u03c8\u2208_\u03c7,g  \u27fa   N\u03c8 = 2\u03c8 and N^\u03c7\u03c8 = \u03c8, N^g\u03c8 = \u03c8.\n\n\nWe note here, and shall use it later, that\n\n\n    _\u03c7,g\u2243\u2113^2(^2\u00d7^2).\n\n\nWe also point out that the transportability of charges remains simple in the two-particle state. Indeed, while  operators corresponding to intersecting strings and dual strings do not commute, the corresponding automorphisms do so: \u0393_\u03b3^g((_v,v',n^\u03c7) (^\u03c7_\u03b3(v'\u2192 v))\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7(A) ^\u03c7_\u03b3(v'\u2192 v)_v,v',n^\u03c7) = (_v,v',n^\u03c7) (^\u03c7_\u03b3(v'\u2192 v)) (\u0393^g_\u03b3\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7)(A) ^\u03c7_\u03b3(v'\u2192 v)_v,v',n^\u03c7. Hence,\n\n\n    (_0, \u03c0_0\u2218\u0393^g_\u03b3\u2218\u0393_\u03b3^\u03c7, T^\u03c7_v\u2192 v'\u03a9_0)\n\n\nis a GNS representation of \u03c9^\u03c7,g_v',f, with the gauge fixed as prescribed. \n\nSince charge is conserved, we obtain the following:\n\n\nLet K^\u03c7,g_\u03b3,\u03b3 be the GNS Hamiltonian introduced in\u00a0(<ref>). Then\n\n\n    K^\u03c7,g_\u03b3,\u03b3_\u03c7,g\u2282_\u03c7,g.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now concentrate our attention on the Hamiltonian restricted to this two-particle (respectively one if either \u03c7 = \u03b9 or g = 1) invariant subspace. The fact that the GNS representation and K^\u03c7,g_\u03b3,\u03b3 are explicit allows us to compute all relevant matrix elements, allowing for a spectral study of the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 A matrix representation of the Hamiltonian\n \n\nTo start with an easy case, we first consider\u00a0(<ref>), denote again v = \u2202\u03b3, and compute\n\n\n    \u27e8\u03c7,v_1 | K_\u03b3^\u03c7 |\u03c7,v\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c7,v_1 | K_\u03b3^\u03c7 | \u03a9_0 \u27e9\n    =\u27e8\u03c7,v_1 |\u03a9_0\u27e9 + \u03bb_\u03f5\u2211_e:v\u2208\u2202 e\u27e8\u03c7,v_1 |\u03c0_0(^\u03c7_(v,e)) \u03a9_0\u27e9\n\n\nIf v\u2260 v_1, then\n\n\n    \u27e8\u03c7,v_1 | \u03c7,v\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c0_0(^\u03c7_\u03b3(v_1\u2192 v))\u03a9_0 |\u03a9_0\u27e9 = \u03c9_0(^\u03c7_\u03b3(v_1\u2192 v))\n\n\nvanishes since \u03c0_0(^\u03c7_\u03b3(v_1\u2192 v)) adds one pair of particles to the existing \u03a9_0. More formally, since \u03c7\u2260\u03b9, there is g\u2208 G such that \u03c7(g)\u2260 1; the invariance of \u03c9_0 under the action of ^g_\u03bb for any closed dual path \u03bb and\u00a0(<ref>) together yield that for any A\u2208,\n\n\n    \u03c9_0(^\u03c7_\u03b3(v_1\u2192 v)) = \u03c9_0((^g_\u03bb)^\u03c7_\u03b3(v_1\u2192 v)^g_\u03bb) = \n    \u03c7(g)\u03c9_0(^\u03c7_\u03b3(v_1\u2192 v))\n\n\nwhenever \u03bb winds once around v but not around v_1, and so \u03c9_0(^\u03c7_\u03b3(v_1\u2192 v)) = 0 indeed.\n\nFor the same reason, \u27e8\u03c7,v_1 |\u03c0_0(^\u03c7_(v,e)) \u03a9_0\u27e9 is non-zero only if ^\u03c7_\u03b3(v_1\u2192 v) = ^\u03c7_(v,e) (in which case it is equal to 1) namely \u03b3(v_1\u2192 v) = (v_1,e). As could have been expected from the basic picture of a single particle freely hopping on the lattice, we conclude that the one-particle Hamiltonian reduces to a multiple of the discrete Laplacian:\n\n\n    \u27e8\u03c7,v_1 | K_\u03b3^\u03c7 |\u03c7,v_2\u27e9=\n    \u03bb_\u03f5   if d(v_1,v_2)=1, \n     \n    1    if v_1 = v_2,\n    \n    0   otherwise.\n\n\nThe same holds for any other type of particle, with the hopping amplitude adjusted accordingly. In the following, we shall renormalize the Hamiltonian by replacing K_\u03b3^\u03c7\u2192 K_\u03b3^\u03c7-.\n\nIn the two-particle situation, it will be convenient to insist on the representation of the lattice using sites. We first rescale the lattice so that vertices are on v\u2208(4)^2 and faces lie on f\u2208(4+2)^2. The sites are then labelled by (2+1)^2. Physically, they correspond to the coordinates of the center of mass of pairs of particles, which we denote \n\n\n    X = 1/2(f+v) \u2208 (2+1)^2.\n\n\nTheir relative position is given by the complementary coordinate\n\n\n    d = 1/2(f-v)\u2208 (2+1)^2,\n\n\nand a general two-particle wavefunction is given by \u03c8(X,d) in \u2113^2((2+1)^2\u00d7(2+1)^2). \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Dirac anyons\n\n\nWe now consider a two-particle state having a charge \u03c7\u2208\u011c at v\u2208 and a charge g\u2208 G at f\u2208. We let \u03bb^\u03f5 = \u03bb^\u03bc = \u03bb to ensure that the duality symmetry holds, and denote \u03bb^\u03f5\u03bc=\u03c1. We shall label the Hamiltonian K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1. As we shall see, the anyonic nature of the composite particle will reveal itself in the appearance of a non-trivial spectrum. \n\nLet us first consider the case \u03bb = 0, \u03c1 = 1. Let S = {(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(-1,-1)}. The results of Section\u00a0(<ref>), see also Figure\u00a0<ref>, imply that the subspace \u2113^2((2+1)^2\u00d7 S) is invariant for K^\u03c7,g_0,1, and that its orthogonal complement is the kernel of the Hamiltonian. After Fourier transforming with respect to the variable X, we conclude that, for k\u2208^2, \n\n\n    K^\u03c7,g_0,1(k) = 2 \n                [              0      cos(2k_y)      cos(2k_x)              0;      cos(2k_y)              0              0 \u03c7(g) cos(2k_x);      cos(2k_x)              0              0      cos(2k_y);              0 \u03c7(g) cos(2k_x)      cos(2k_y)              0;                ].\n\n\nAs discussed earlier, the phase \u03c7(g) is accumulated by the hopping of the particles across each other's string, which happens only in the case (1,-1)\u2194(-1,-1), see again Figure\u00a0<ref>. We obtain four bands given explicitly by\n\n\n    E^\u03c7,g_0,1(k) = \u00b12\u221a(cos^2(2k_x)+cos^2(2k_y)\u00b1|cos(2k_x)cos(2k_y)|\u221a(2+2Re\u03c7(g)))).\n\n\nGenerically, this exhibits a Dirac cone at (\u03c0/4,\u03c0/4), see Figure\u00a0<ref>. The case \u03c7(g) = -1, which arises for example for G = _2, is special in that two sheets are exactly degenerate.\n\n\nThe case \u03c7(g) = 1 is trivial with dispersion relation \u00b1 2cos(2k_x)\u00b12cos(2k_y). It corresponds to simple bosons with no phase being accumulated as the strings cross each other. Unsurprisingly maybe, the anyonic nature of the quasi-particles manifests itself in the spectrum of the two-particles Hamiltonian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dirac cone is a consequence of the duality symmetry, and it is not stable under the breaking of the symmetry. If we consider an asymmetric hopping by giving a different weight to the two terms of\u00a0(<ref>), namely (\n\u2131^\u03c7_(v,e)\u03b9_v'\u03c7_v +  \u2131^\u03c7_(v',e)\u03b9_v\u03c7_v'\n)(_f^h + _f'^h) and (1+m)(\n\u2131^h\u0305_(f,e)^1_f'^h_f + \u2131^h\u0305_(f',e)^1_f^h_f'\n)(_v^\u03c7 + _v'^\u03c7), with m>0, the dispersion relation then reads\n\n\n    E^(\u03c7,g)_0,1(k) = \u00b1\u221a(| c(k_x)|^2+| c(k_y)|^2\u00b1| c(k_x)|| c(k_y)|\u221a(2+2Re\u03c7(g))).\n\n\nwhere c(s) = 2 s + (1+m)-2 s opening up a gap of size 2 m at the Dirac point, see Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Bound states and scattering states.\n The dynamics discussed above is that of a strictly bound pair of a flux and a charge. In the presence of the additional terms producing independent hoppings of the charge and the flux, we now show that the bound pair may become unstable and decay into two freely moving particles scattering away from each other.\n\nFirst of all we prove that, in the extreme case \u03c1 = 0 and \u03bb\u2260 0, there is no bound state of the two particles at all. The restriction of H^\u03f5+H^\u03bc to the invariant space _\u03c7,g is immediately read off\u00a0(<ref>,<ref>). As in Section\u00a0<ref>, it reduces to a simple discrete Laplacian, up to the phase picked up whenever the \u03c7 particle crosses the string \u03b3 associated with the g flux and reciprocally. After subtraction of the constant, we obtain\n\n\n    K^\u03c7,g_1,0(k) = 2cos(2 k_x)\u0394\u2297+2 cos(2k_y) \u2297\u0394\n    +2cos(2 k_x) (\u03c7(g) \u03c3^+ + \u03c7(g)\u03c3^- - \u03c3^x) \u2297\u0398,\n\n\nacting on the fibers \u2113^2(2+1)\u2297\u2113^2(2+1) and corresponding to the dynamics of the relative coordinate. Here\n\n\n    (\u0394\u03c8)(z) = \u03c8(z-2) + \u03c8(z+2)\n\n\nfor any z\u2208 2 + 1 and \u0398 is the multiplication operator by the characteristic function of {j\u22082+1,j<0}. In the last term, \u03c3^\u266f are the Pauli matrices acting in the space spanned by |\u00b11\u27e9 (as a function in \u2113^2(2 + 1), the vector | m\u27e9 for m\u22082 + 1 is the normalized sequence whose only non-zero element is at m), and this term amounts to replacing the trivial phase accumulated along a hopping by \u03c7(g), respectively \u03c7(g), whenever the two strings cross. \n\n\nLet k\u2260(\u03c0/4,\u03c0/4) (mod\u03c0/2). The pure point spectrum of K^(\u03c7,g)_1,0(k) is empty.\n\n\n\nWe recall the setting of\u00a0<cit.>, which is very close to the current situation. For j=1,2, let T^A_j\u2208(\u2113^2((2+1)^2)) be the magnetic translations in the direction of the unit vectors e_j, associated with a magnetic vector potential A: (2+1)^2\u00d7(2+1)^2\u2192:\n\n\n    (T_e_j\u03c8)(x) = - A(x,x+2e_j)\u03c8(r+2e_j).\n\n\nHere A is so that -A(x,y) = A(y,x). A simple calculation yields that (T_e_j) = (T_e_j)^-1 = T_-e_j. They satisfy the following commutation relations\n\n\n    T_e_j^-1T_e_k^-1T_e_jT_e_k = -\u03d5_(e_k,e_j),\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n    \u03d5_(e_k,e_j)(x) = A(x,x-2e_j) + A(x-2e_j, x-2e_j-2e_k) - A(x-2e_k,x-2e_k-2e_j) - A(x,x-2e_k)\n\n\nis naturally interpreted as the flux through the face centred at x-e_k-e_j\u2208(2)^2; In particular it is equal to zero whenever j=k. Note that -\u03d5_(e_k,e_j) is to be understood as the corresponding multiplication operator. \n\nThe magnetic Hamiltonian is given by\n\n\n    H = c_1(T_e_1 + T_-e_1) + c_2(T_e_2 + T_-e_2),\n\n\nwhere c_1,c_2 are real constants. Let q(x) = \u27e8 x,x\u27e9, where \u27e8,\u27e9 is the restriction of the Euclidean inner product to (2+1)^2. Let now\n\n\n    A = [H,q].\n\n\nWe observe that for any function f,\n\n\n    [T_e_j,f] = (D_e_jf)T_e_j\n\n\nwhere (D_e_jf)(x) = f(x+2e_j) - f(x), and that \n\n\n    D_e_jD_e_kq = 8 \u27e8 e_j,e_k\u27e9.\n\n\nA computation now yields that\n\n\n    /8[H, A] = -\u2211_j,k=1^2(T_e_j-T_-e_j) c_j \u27e8 e_j,e_k\u27e9 c_k(T_e_k-T_-e_k) + C,\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n    C = \u2211_j, k=1^2(c_jc_k)(D_e_kq)[T_e_j + T_-e_j,T_e_k] + (c_jc_k)(D_-e_kq)[T_e_j + T_-e_j,T_-e_k]\n\n\nis only non-zero because of the non-commutativity of the magnetic translations, since\n\n\n    [T_e_j,T_e_k] = ( - -\u03d5_(-e_j,-e_k)))T_e_jT_e_k.\n\n\n\nLet us now consider the specific case K^\u03c7,g_1,0(k), namely\n\n\n    c_1 = 2cos(2k_x),   c_2 = 2cos(2k_y),  - A(x,x+2e_j)=\u03c7(g) \u03b4_j,1\u03b4_x_1,-1\u03b4_x_2<0.\n\n\nHere, the magnetic vector potential corresponds to a flux tube through the plaquette at (0,0). Hence, the factor 1 - -\u03d5_(\u2213 e_j,\u2213 e_k)(x) appearing in C does not vanish if and only if x\u00b1 e_j\u00b1 e_k = (0,0). In particular, it vanishes if x\u2209 S and hence C is a finite rank operator.\n\nWe now note that q(x) = \u2016 x\u2016^2 is constant on S and hence (D_e_kq)(x) vanishes for all (e_k,x) such that \u03d5_(-e_j,-e_k)(x)\u2260 0. It follows that C=0 and\n\n\n    /8[K^\u03c7,g_1,0(k), A] = -\u2211_j=1^2c_j^2(T_e_j-T_-e_j)^2 = \u2211_j=1^2c_j^2(T_e_j-T_-e_j)(T_e_j-T_-e_j),\n\n\nwhich is the sum of two non-negative, but mutually non-commuting, terms. The triangle inequality yields\n\n\n    | ((T_e_j-T_-e_j)\u03c8)(x)|\u2265||\u03c8(x+2e_j)| - |\u03c8(x-2e_j)||\n    =| ((T_e_j^0-T_-e_j^0)|\u03c8|)(x) |,\n\n\nwhere T_e_j^0 are translation operators with A=0. This is a discrete version of the diamagnetic inequality. Hence,\n\n\n    1/8\u27e8\u03c8,[K^\u03c7,g_1,0(k), A]\u03c8\u27e9\u2265\u2211_j=1^2c_j^2\u2016 (T_e_j^0-T_-e_j^0)|\u03c8|\u2016^2\n\n\nand it suffices to show that Ker(T_e_j^0-T_-e_j^0) = {0} to rule out pure point spectrum. That is immediate since the only square summable solution of\n\n\n    ((T_e_j^0-T_-e_j^0)\u03c8)(x) = \u03c8(x+2e_j)-\u03c8(x-2e_j) = 0\n\n\nis the zero function.\n\n\nWe now turn to the full Hamiltonian K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1 in the two-particle sector. Let P be the orthogonal projection onto the space spanned by |\u00b11\u27e9. Then\n\n\n    K^\u03c7,g_0,1(k) = cos(2 k_x)\u03c3^x\u2297(\u03c3^z+P)+2 cos(2k_y) P \u2297\u03c3^x\n    +cos(2k_x)(\u03c7(g) \u03c3^+ + \u03c7(g)\u03c3^-) \u2297(P-\u03c3^z),\n\n\nwhich, combined with K^\u03c7,g_1,0(k) given in\u00a0(<ref>), yields the full Hamiltonian. \n\n\nFor any k\u2208^2, let R_\u03bb(k) = 4 \u03bb(|cos(2k_x)| + |cos(2k_y)|). Then\n\n\n    \u03c3_ess(K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(k)) = [-R_\u03bb(k),R_\u03bb(k)],\n\n\nin particular, the essential spectrum is independent of \u03c1.\n\n\n\nSince K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(k) = K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,0(k) + K^\u03c7,g_0,\u03c1(k), the independence of the essential spectrum on the parameter\u00a0\u03c1 follows from the fact that K^\u03c7,g_0,\u03c1(k) is a finite rank perturbation. It therefore suffices to consider\u00a0(<ref>), which is the magnetic operator with a simple flux tube considered in Proposition\u00a0<ref>. The claim follows from\u00a0Section\u00a02 of\u00a0<cit.>: The vector potential given here is gauge equivalent to the Aharonov-Bohm gauge \u00c3 and therefore K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,0(k) is unitarily equivalent to the operator K\u0303^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,0(k) given by magnetic translations with \u00c3 replacing\u00a0A. If we now denote K_\u03bb,0(k) the operator corresponding to A=0 (it does not depend on (\u03c7,g) indeed), then K\u0303^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,0(k) - K_\u03bb,0(k) is compact by Proposition\u00a03 in\u00a0<cit.>. Hence the essential spectrum of the full K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(k) equals that of K_\u03bb,0(k), which is a sum of two independent discrete Laplacians, concluding the proof.\n\n\nWe conclude with a proof that K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(k) has bound states for a range of parameters \u03bb,\u03c1. If \u03bb>0 then in particular K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(k) has a bound state for all \u03c1>0, in a neighbourhood of the two lines (k_x,\u03c0/4) and (\u03c0/4,k_y).\n\n\nLet | 1+\u03c1/\u03bb|>1 and let k_x\u2260\u03c0/4 (mod\u03c0/2). Then there is a neighbourhood  of (k_x,\u03c0/4) such that if k\u2208, then K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(k) has four possibly degenerate eigenvalues; The corresponding eigenstates are exponentially localized.\n\n\n\nFirst of all,\n\n\n    K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(k_x,\u03c0/4) = \u03bbcos(2k_x) {   (\u03c7(g) \u03c3^+ + \u03c7(g)\u03c3^-)\u2297(2\u0398 + \u03c1/\u03bb(P-\u03c3^z)) \n        + 2\u0394\u2297\ud835\udd40 + \u03c3^x\u2297(-2\u0398+ \u03c1/\u03bb(P+\u03c3^z)) }.\n\n\nAs should be expected, this operator is diagonal in the second tensor factor. Therefore, it suffices to search for eigenstates of the form \u03c8\u2297| j\u27e9 for any j\u2208 2+1. Then K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(k_x,\u03c0/4) \u03c8\u2297| j\u27e9 =  2\u03bbcos(2k_x) (\u0394_j^\u03c7,g\u03c8) \u2297|j\u27e9, where the matrix elements of \u0394_j^\u03c7,g are\n\n\n    (\u0394_j^\u03c7,g)_m,n = \n    1    if | m-n| = 2  and (| m|,| n| )\u2260 (1,1) \n    \n    b_j    if (m,n) = (-1,1) \n    b_j   if (m,n) = (1,-1) \n    \n    0    otherwise\n\n\nand the values of b_j are given by\n\n\n    b_j = \u03c7(g)    if j<-1 \n    \u03c7(g)(1+ \u03c1/\u03bb)    if j=-1 \n    \n    (1+ \u03c1/\u03bb)    if j=1 \n    \n    1    otherwise\n\n\nThis is amenable to a transfer matrix analysis. If \u03c8 is an eigenvector of \u0394_j^\u03c7,g for the eigenvalue E, then the vector \u03d5 given by \u03d5_n = (\u03c8_2n+1,\u03c8_2n-1)^T solves\n\n\n    T\u03d5_n = \u03d5_n+1,     \n    T = [  E -1;  1  0 ]\n\n\nfor all n\u2208\u2216{-1,0}, with boundary condition given by\n\n\n    \u03d5_0 = \n    [  E/b_j -1/b_j;      1      0 ]\u03d5_-1,    \u03d5_1 = \n    [    E -b_j;    1    0 ]\u03d5_0,\n\n\nnamely\n\n\n    \u03d5_1 = B_j\u03d5_-1,     \n    B_j = [ (E^2-| b_j|^2)/b_j             -E/b_j;              E/b_j             -1/b_j ].\n\n\nThe two eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are equal to \u03c4_\u00b1=1/2(E\u00b1\u221a(E^2-4)) with eigenvectors v_\u00b1= (\n\u03c4_\u00b1,1)^T. The eigenvector gives rise to a solution of the eigenvalue equation that decays exponentially at +\u221e, respectively -\u221e, if the corresponding eigenvalue has modulus <1, respectively >1. Both necessarily happen simultaneously since \u03c4_+\u03c4_- = 1. If | E|>2, then \u03c4_\u00b1 are real with \u03c4_+>1. Otherwise \u03c4_- = \u03c4_+ and hence |\u03c4_\u00b1| = 1. Therefore, a normalizable solution of the eigenvalue equation may only exist if | E|>2. In that case, we set \u03d5_1 = \u03b1 v_- for some \u03b1\u2260 0 and \u03d5_-1 = v_+ and the boundary condition\u00a0(<ref>) reduces after elimination of \u03b1 to an equation for the energy\n\n\n    (E^2 - | b_j|^2)\u03c4_+^2 =2 E\u03c4_+ - 1\n\n\nor equivalently \n\n\n    | b_j|^2 = \u03c4_+^2.\n\n\nSince |\u03c4_+|>1, we conclude that a solution exists if and only if | b_j|>1, which in turn holds if and only if j=\u00b1 1 and | 1+ \u03c1/\u03bb| >1. The eigenvalues are given by\n\n\n    E = \u03c4_+ +\u03c4_- = \u00b1(B + B^-1),     B = | 1+ \u03c1/\u03bb|,\n\n\neach of them being doubly degenerate since | b_1| = | b_-1|.\n\nIf | 1+ \u03c1/\u03bb| >1, the rest of the spectrum of \u0394_j^\u03c7,g lies in [-2,2] and corresponds to oscillatory solutions. In particular, the spectrum of K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(k_x,\u03c0/4) is characterized by a gap g(k_x) given by\n\n\n    g(k_x) = 2\u03bb|cos(2k_x) |(B + B^-1 -2),\n\n\nand g(k_x)>0 for all k_x\u2260\u03c0/4 (mod\u03c0/2). Since the operator-valued function k\u21a6 K^(\u03c7,g)_\u03bb,\u03c1(k)\u2208(\u2113^2((2+1)^2)) is smooth, the existence of four branches of eigenstates in a neighbourhood of (k_x,\u03c0/4) away from the degenerate points k_x\u2260\u03c0/4 (mod\u03c0/2) is ensured by spectral perturbation theory.\n\n\n\nA similar, and simpler, analysis can be carried out around (\u03c0/4,k_y). In that case, the Hamiltonian reduces to\n\n\n    K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(\u03c0/4,k_y) =2 \u03bbcos(2k_y) ( \u2297\u0394 + \u03c1/\u03bb P \u2297\u03c3^x)\n\n\nwhich is now diagonal with respect to the first factor. It is a simple Laplacian (and therefore has no bound state) on the range of - P, while \n\n\n    K^\u03c7,g_\u03bb,\u03c1(\u03c0/4,k_y)P\u2297 = 2 \u03bbcos(2k_y) P\u2297(\u0394 + \u03c1/\u03bb\u03c3^x)\n\n\nwhich is of the same form as above, with b_\u00b11\u2192 1+\u03c1/\u03bb. We conclude again that two bound states exist for any k_y provided | 1+\u03c1/\u03bb|>1 and they are stable away from the degenerate points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Acknowledgements\n\nBased upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grants DMS\u20131813149 and DMS\u201321083901 (B.N. & S.V.).
