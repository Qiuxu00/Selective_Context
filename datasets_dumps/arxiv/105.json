Nevertheless, higher-order corrections to the wave function at the origin for unequal masses are still missing in the literature.\n  \n\n\nIn this paper we will complete the computation of three-loop QCD corrections to the     matching coefficients  for    vector, axial-vector, scalar\t\tand pseudo-scalar currents with two different heavy quark masses, where the axial-vector case is achieved for the first time. We will not attempt to calculate the rigorous N^3LO expression of the wave function at origin for the double heavy quark system with different masses based on the pNRQCD effective theory, but employ the scale relation to obtain the   N^3LO correction to the wave functions at the origin for the vector B_c^* meson and the pseudo-scalar B_c meson   from  the known result for the equal-mass  heavy quarkonium. After  the three-loop matching coefficients are combined with the N^3LO corrections to the wave functions at the origin, the resultant decay constants for B_c^* and B_c   will test the perturbative convergence in the NRQCD effective theory.\n  \n  \n\n \n\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we introduce the  matching formula between QCD and NRQCD.\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>,  we describe details of our calculation procedure.\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we  present the three-loop analytical results of  the  renormalization constants and corresponding anomalous dimensions  in NRQCD.\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we present our numeric results of the  matching coefficients up to N^3LO.\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>, the phenomenological applications of three-loop matching coefficients to the cb\u0305 mesons are presented.\nSec.\u00a0<ref> contains a summary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MATCHING FORMULA \u00a0\n\nThe heavy flavor-changing  currents in the full QCD are defined by\n\n    j_v^\u03bc = \u03c8\u0305_b \u03b3^\u03bc\u03c8_c,\n    \n       \n    j_p     = \u03c8\u0305_b  i\u03b3_5 \u03c8_c,\n    \n       \n    j_a^\u03bc = \u03c8\u0305_b \u03b3^\u03bc\u03b3_5 \u03c8_c,\n    \n       \n    j_s     = \u03c8\u0305_b \u03c8_c,\n\nwhich  can be expanded  in terms of NRQCD currents as follows,\n\n\n    j_v^0 = 0+ \ud835\udcaa(u^2),\n    \n       \n    j_v^i = \ud835\udc9e_vj\u0303_v^i + \ud835\udcaa(u^2),\n    \n       \n    j_p     = \ud835\udc9e_pj\u0303_p + \ud835\udcaa(u^2),\n    \n       \n    j_a^0 = \ud835\udc9e_a,0j\u0303_a^0 + \ud835\udcaa(u^2),\n    \n       \n    j_a^i = \ud835\udc9e_a,ij\u0303_a^i + \ud835\udcaa(u^3),\n    \n       \n    j_s     = \ud835\udc9e_sj\u0303_s + \ud835\udcaa(u^3),\n\nwhere u  refers   to the small relative velocity   between the bottom and charm,\n \ud835\udc9e_v,\ud835\udc9e_p,\ud835\udc9e_a,0,\ud835\udc9e_a,i, \ud835\udc9e_s\n are the matching coefficients for the   heavy flavor-changing      vector, pseudo-scalar, the zeroth component of axial-vector, the space-like component of axial-vector, and scalar currents, respectively. And the NRQCD currents read\n \n    j\u0303_v^i = \u03c6_b^\u2020\u03c3^i \u03c7_c,\n    \n       j\u0303_p     = - i \u03c6_b^\u2020\u03c7_c,\n    \n       j\u0303_a^0 = \u03c6_b^\u2020\u03c7_c,\n    \n       j\u0303_a^i = 1/4 m_r\u03c6_b^\u2020[\u03c3^i,k\u20d7\u00b7\u03c3\u20d7] \u03c7_c,\n    \n       j\u0303_s     = -1/2m_r\u03c6_b^\u2020k\u20d7\u00b7\u03c3\u20d7\u03c7_c,\n\nwhere  \u03c6_b^\u2020 and \u03c7_c denote 2-component Pauli spinor  fields annihilating the b\u0305 and c quarks, respectively, and j\u0303_p=- i j\u0303_a^0 means \ud835\udc9e_p=\ud835\udc9e_a,0.\n|k\u20d7|= m_r u  refers   to the small half relative spatial  momentum  between the bottom and charm.   m_r=m_b m_c/(m_b+m_c) is the reduced  mass with bottom mass m_b and charm mass m_c.\n\n\nThe heavy flavor-changing  currents in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) can be related to  the on-shell unrenormalized  vertex functions in QCD and NRQCD\nwhich we denote by \u0393_J and \u0393_J with\nJ\u2208{v,p,(a,0),(a,i),s}, respectively.\nThen the matching coefficients can be determined through the conventional perturbative matching procedure. Namely, one  performs renormalization for  the on-shell vertex functions in both perturbative QCD and perturbative\nNRQCD sides, then solves the matching coefficient  order by order in \u03b1_s.\nThe matching formula with renormalization procedure reads\n\n    \u221a(Z_2,b Z_2,c) Z_J \u0393_J =\n    \ud835\udc9e_J(\u03bc_f,\u03bc,m_b,m_c)  \u221a(Z_2,bZ_2,c) Z_J^-1 \u0393_J + \ud835\udcaa(u^2),\n\nwhere  the left part in the equation represents the renormalization of full QCD current while the right part represents the renormalization of NRQCD current.\n\ud835\udcaa(u^2) denotes higher order relativistic corrections in powers of the  relative velocity u between the bottom quark  b\u0305 and the charm quark c,\nand in this paper we will calculate \nhigher-order QCD corrections up to \ud835\udcaa(\u03b1_s^3)   but at the lowest order in u.\n At the leading-order (LO), we set \ud835\udc9e_J=1,\nwhile in a fixed high order QCD correction calculation,\n  the matching coefficient \ud835\udc9e_J(\u03bc_f,\u03bc,m_b,m_c) depends NRQCD factorization scale \u03bc_f and QCD  renormalization scale \u03bc.\nIn on-shell (OS) scheme,   NRQCD  quark field renormalization constants Z_2,b=Z_2,c=1.\n Z_J is NRQCD current renormalization constant in the modified-minimal-subtraction (MS) scheme and Z_p=Z_a,0.\n Z_J is QCD  current on-shell  renormalization constant, i.e., Z_v=Z_a,0=Z_a,i=1, Z_p=Z_s=(m_b Z_m,b+m_c Z_m,c)/(m_b+m_c). Z_2 and Z_m are QCD  quark field and mass on-shell renormalization constants, respectively.\n The three-loop analytical results of  the QCD quark field and mass on-shell  renormalization constants  allowing for two different non-zero quark masses  can be found in literature\u00a0<cit.>, which can be  evaluated to high numerical precision  with the package \u00a0<cit.>.\n The QCD coupling MS renormalization constant can be found in literature\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CALCULATION PROCEDURE\u00a0\n\n\nOur high-order calculation  consists of the following steps.\n\n\t\n  * First, we use \u00a0<cit.>  to obtain Feynman diagrams and corresponding Feynman amplitudes. By \u00a0<cit.>, we decompose  every Feyman amplitude  into several Feynman integral families.\n\t\n  * Second, we use \u00a0<cit.>/\u00a0<cit.>/\u00a0<cit.> based on Integration by Parts (IBP)\u00a0<cit.> to reduce every Feynman integral family to master integral family.\n\t\n  * Third,\n\tbased on symmetry among different integral families and using   +  + , we can realize  integral reduction among different integral families, and further on, the reduction from all of master integral families to the minimal set\u00a0<cit.> of master  integral families.\n\t\n  * Last, we use \u00a0<cit.>, which is a proof-of-concept implementation of the auxiliary mass flow method\u00a0<cit.>, equipped with \u00a0<cit.>/\u00a0<cit.> to calculate the minimal set  family by family.\n\nIn order to obtain the finite results of  high-order QCD corrections, one has to perform the  conventional renormalization procedure\u00a0<cit.>. Equivalently, We can also use diagrammatic renormalization method\u00a0<cit.>  with the aid of the package \u00a0<cit.>, which at N^3LO sums contributions from three-loop diagrams and four  kinds of counter-term diagrams, i.e.,  tree diagram   inserted with one \u03b1_s^3-order counter-term vertex, one-loop diagram inserted with one \u03b1_s^2-order counter-term vertex, one-loop diagram inserted with two \u03b1_s-order counter-term vertexes, two-loop diagrams inserted with one \u03b1_s-order counter-term vertex. Our final finite results by these two renormalization methods are in agreement with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to mention that all contributions up to NNLO have been evaluated for general gauge parameter \u03be and the NNLO results of the  matching coefficients   for the heavy flavor-changing   currents   are all independent of \u03be, which constitutes an important check on our calculation.\nAt N^3LO, we work in  Feynman gauge. To check  the correctness of\nour results, we also calculated the three-loop matching coefficient  for the  flavor-changing heavy quark pseudo-scalar current with keeping  the linear \u03be-dependence terms and we have\nverified these terms vanish  in the final results of the matching coefficient. Therefore, we conjecture the matching coefficients, the NRQCD current renormalization constants and the corresponding anomalous dimensions for flavor-changing heavy quark currents  are gauge invariant up to all order of \u03b1_s.\nBy FeynCalc, there are 1, 1, 13, 268 bare Feynman diagrams for the QCD vertex function with every heavy flavor-changing   current  at tree, one-loop, two-loop, three-loop orders in \u03b1_s, respectively.\nSome representative Feynman diagrams up to  three loops  are displayed in Fig.\u00a0<ref> and Fig.\u00a0<ref>.\nIn the calculation of multi-loop diagrams, we have allowed for n_b bottom quarks with mass m_b, n_c charm quarks  with mass m_c and n_l massless quarks appearing in the quark loop.\nTo facilitate our calculation, we take full advantage of computing numerically. Namely, before generating amplitudes, m_b and m_c are chosen to be particular rational numbers values\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nFollowing the literature\u00a0<cit.>, we employ the projectors constructed for the heavy flavor-changing   currents   to obtain intended QCD vertex functions, which means one need extend    the projectors for   various   currents   with equal heavy quark masses in Eq.(7)  and Eq.(8) of Ref.\u00a0<cit.> to the different heavy quark masses case. We choose q_1=m_c/m_b+m_cq+k and q_2=m_b/m_b+m_cq-k denoting the on-shell charm and bottom momentum, respectively, and present the projectors for the heavy flavor-changing  currents  as\n\n    P_(v),\u03bc =   1/2(D-1)(m_b+m_c)^2(m_c/m_b+m_cq + m_c\n    ) \u03b3_\u03bc(-m_b/m_b+m_cq + m_b\n    ),\n    \n    \n    P_(p) =   1/2(m_b+m_c)^2(m_c/m_b+m_cq + m_c\n    ) \u03b3_5 (-m_b/m_b+m_cq + m_b\n    ),\n    \n    \n    P_(a,0),\u03bc =    -1/2(m_b+m_c)^2(m_c/m_b+m_cq + m_c\n    ) \u03b3_\u03bc\u03b3_5 (-m_b/m_b+m_cq + m_b\n    ),\n    \n    \n    P_(a,i),\u03bc =    -1/2(m_b+m_c)^2{1/D-1m_c/m_b+m_c(m_c/m_b+m_cq + m_c\n    ) \u03b3_\u03bc\u03b3_5(m_b/m_b+m_cq + m_b\n    )\n    \n       \n    +1/D-1m_b/m_b+m_c(-m_c/m_b+m_cq + m_c\n    ) \u03b3_\u03bc\u03b3_5(-m_b/m_b+m_cq + m_b\n    )\n    \n       \n    - 1/D-22 m_b m_c/m_b+m_c(m_c/m_b+m_cq + m_c\n    ) -k_\u03bc + \u03b3_\u03bck/k^2\u03b3_5 (-m_b/m_b+m_cq + m_b) },\n    \n    P_(s) =    1/2(m_b+m_c)^2{m_c/m_b+m_c(m_c/m_b+m_cq + m_c\n    )  1(m_b/m_b+m_cq + m_b)\n    \n       \n    +m_b/m_b+m_c(-m_c/m_b+m_cq + m_c\n    )  1(-m_b/m_b+m_cq + m_b)\n    \n       \n    +2 m_b m_c/m_b+m_c(m_c/m_b+m_cq + m_c) k/k^2(-m_b/m_b+m_cq + m_b) },\n\nwhere the small momentum k refers to  relative movement  between the bottom and charm, q represents the total momentum of the bottom and charm, q_1^2=m_c^2, q_2^2=m_b^2, q^2=(m_b+m_c)^2+\ud835\udcaa(k^2)\u00a0<cit.>, q\u00b7 k=0. With the help of projectors, the  on-shell heavy flavor-changing current vertex functions in full QCD can be obtained as\n\n    \u0393_v = [ P_(v),\u03bc\u0393_(v)^\u03bc] ,\n    \n       \u0393_p = [ P_(p)\u0393_(p)] ,\n    \n       \u0393_a,0 = [ P_(a,0),\u03bc\u0393_(a)^\u03bc] ,\n    \n       \u0393_a,i = [ P_(a,i),\u03bc\u0393_(a)^\u03bc] ,\n    \n       \u0393_s = [ P_(s)\u0393_(s)] ,\n\nwhere \u0393_(v)^\u03bc, \u0393_(p), \u0393_(a)^\u03bc, \u0393_(s)    denote QCD amplitudes with tensor structures for the vector, pseudo-scalar, axial-vector, scalar currents, respectively.\n\nSince contributions from soft, potential and ultrasoft loop momenta in full QCD and NRQCD are identical,  thus they drop out from both sides of the matching formula in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\nThen we set  \u0393_J=1\u00a0<cit.> in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and   \u0393_J  turns into  the hard  part of the full QCD, which entirely   determines   the matching coefficients  to all orders.\nTo match with NRQCD and obtain the matching coefficients, one need extract the contribution from the hard region in full QCD amplitudes for the heavy flavor-changing currents.\nFor the vector current, the pseudo-scalar current and the zeroth component of the axial-vector current case, we can simply set  the   small momentum  k=0 in the QCD amplitudes.\nHowever, for  the space-like component of the axial-vector current and the scalar current  case, since NRQCD currents include contributions at \ud835\udcaa(k/m_r) from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), accordingly,\none need first introduce the small  momentum k to momenta in the QCD amplitudes  and then series expand propagator denominators with respect to k up to \ud835\udcaa(k) in  the hard region of loop momenta\u00a0<cit.>, which will cancel k^2 in the denominators of the   projectors in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) so that we can obtain the finite final results   as k^2 \u2192 0.\n\nDue to the expansion in powers of k, the number and powers of propagators in Feynman integrals constituting the amplitudes for the space-like component of the axial-vector current and the scalar current will remarkably increase compared with  the vector current case, the pseudo-scalar current and the zeroth component of the axial-vector current case. In our practice, the total number  of propagators in a three-loop Feynman integral family is 12 for the former two currents and 9 for the latter three currents. In our calculation, the most difficult and   time-consuming is\nthe reduction from three-loop Feynman integrals    with rank 5, dot 4, and 12  propagators   to master integrals. By trial and  error, we find it is more  appropriate for  Fire6\u00a0<cit.> to deal with this problem than \u00a0<cit.> or \u00a0<cit.>.\nFor  every heavy flavor-changing current, after  using  ++ to achieve the minimal set of master integral families  from  all of master integral families    based on symmetry among different integral families, the number of three-loop master integral families is reduced from 830s  to 26, meanwhile the number of three-loop master integrals is reduced from 13000s  to 300.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 NRQCD CURRENT RENORMALIZATION CONSTANTS\u00a0\n\n\nAfter implementing the quark field and  mass on-shell renormalization, and  the QCD coupling constant MS renormalization, the QCD vertex function gets rid of ultra-violet (UV) poles, yet still contains  uncancelled infra-red (IR) poles starting from order \u03b1_s^2.  The remaining IR poles in QCD should be exactly  cancelled by the UV divergences of Z_J in NRQCD,  rendering the matching coefficient finite.  With the aid of the obtained high-precision numerical results, combined with the structures and features of NRQCD  current renormalization constants investigated in other known literature\u00a0<cit.>,    we have successfully reconstructed the exact analytical expressions of the NRQCD  renormalization constants for the heavy flavor-changing   currents\n through the PSLQ algorithm and \n\nnumerical fitting recipes\u00a0<cit.>.

Eq.\u00a0(<ref>),\nwe investigate the renormalization scale dependence of the matching coefficients \ud835\udc9e_J for the heavy flavor-changing  currents\nat LO,  NLO,  NNLO and N^3LO accuracy in Fig.\u00a0<ref>.\nThe middle lines correspond to the choice of \u03bc_f=1.2 GeV for the NRQCD factorization scale, and the upper and lower  edges   of the error bands\ncorrespond to \u03bc_f=0.4 GeV and \u03bc_f=2\u00a0GeV, respectively.\n\nWe also present our precise numerical results of the matching coefficients \ud835\udc9e_J  at LO,  NLO ,  NNLO and N^3LO in Table\u00a0<ref>, where the uncertainties from \u03bc_f and \u03bc are included.\n\nFrom Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), Fig.\u00a0<ref> and Table\u00a0<ref>, one can find the higher order QCD corrections have larger values, especially, the O(\u03b1_s^3) correction looks quite sizable, which confirms the nonconvergence behaviors of the matching coefficients investigated in previous literature\u00a0<cit.>. From  Fig.\u00a0<ref> and Table\u00a0<ref>, it seems that both the NRQCD factorization scale dependence and the QCD renormalization scale dependence become larger at higher order.\nNote, at each truncated perturbative order, the matching coefficient \ud835\udc9e_J  is renormalization-group invariant\u00a0<cit.>, e.g., at N^3LO, \ud835\udc9e_J obeys the following renormalization-group running invariance:\n\n    \ud835\udc9e_J^ N^3LO(\u03bc_f,\u03bc,m_b,m_c) =\ud835\udc9e_J^ N^3LO(\u03bc_f,\u03bc_0,m_b,m_c) +\ud835\udcaa(\u03b1_s^4),\n\nwhere \ud835\udc9e_J^ N^3LO(\u03bc_f,\u03bc,m_b,m_c) has dropped the \ud835\udcaa(\u03b1_s^4) terms in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). So the  \u03bc-dependence of the  N^3LO results is at the \ud835\udcaa(\u03b1_s^4) order. Though the  \u03bc-dependence is suppressed by \u03b1_s^4, the coefficients of \u03b1_s^4  in  above equation  contain \u03bc-independent terms such as \ud835\udc9e_J^(3)(x) and ln\u03bc_f, which come from the \ud835\udcaa(\u03b1_s^3) order in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), and have   considerably large values by aforementioned  calculation within the framework of NRQCD factorization. As a result, these terms will lead to a significantly larger renormalization scale dependence at N^3LO. From Fig.\u00a0<ref>, we also find the NRQCD factorization scale \u03bc_f has a dominant influence on the higher order QCD corrections.\nWhen \u03bc_f decreases, both the convergence of \u03b1_s expansion  and the independence of \u03bc will improve.\n\nSince  the  matching coefficients   on their own  are nonphysical, in order to obtain  a  reliable higher order correction to a physical quantity, the large \u03b1_s-expansion nonconvergence  and the strong scale  dependence of the  matching coefficients at higher order  especially  \ud835\udcaa(\u03b1_s^3)     have to be  compensated by other higher order corrections.\nWithin the NRQCD effective  theroy,  physical quantities such as    the   beauty-charmed meson B_c and B^*_c decay constants   are factorized to the  matching coefficients   multiplied  with the long-distance nonperturbative NRQCD matrix elements (the Schr\u00f6dinger  wave functions at the origin), therefore we  not only need to calculate the  higher   order  QCD  corrections to the matching coefficients, but also need to perform the  higher   order corrections to the    wave functions at the origin.\nBesides, it is also  indispensable to take into account  higher order relativistic corrections, resummation techniques and so on ( also see   Refs.\u00a0<cit.> for more discussions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS\u00a0\n\nBefore starting our discussions about phenomenological applications of the matching coefficients, one can  review related  discussions in Refs.\u00a0<cit.>. For  an explicit example, one can also see Eq.(4) in Ref.\u00a0<cit.>, where the leptonic decay width of \u03a5 meson was calculated up to N^3LO within NRQCD and pNRQCD effective theory and \na large cancellation between three-loop perturbative QCD corrections to the matching coefficient and N^3LO perturbative corrections to the wave function at the origin was presented.\nAs following, we will confirm this phenomenon is also in the cb\u0305 meson systems and   evaluate three-loop corrections to the decay constants, leptonic decay widths and corresponding branching ratios of the beauty-charmed mesons B_c and B^*_c.\n\nWe use the following formulas \u00a0<cit.> to compute\nthe decay constants  f_B_c^* of the  vector  B_c^* meson and f_B_c of the pseudoscalar  B_c meson:\n\n    f_B_c^*=2\u00a0\u221a(N_c/m_B_c^*)\u00a0[\ud835\udc9e_v+d_v E_B_c^*/12(8/M-3/m_r)]\n    \u00a0|\u03a8_B_c^*(0)|,\n       \n    f_B_c=2\u00a0\u221a(N_c/m_B_c)\u00a0[\ud835\udc9e_p-d_p E_B_c/4m_r]\n    \u00a0|\u03a8_B_c(0)|,\n\nwhere M=m_b+m_c, m_r=m_b m_c/(m_b+m_c) is the reduced mass, m_B_c^* and m_B_c are the masses of the vector and pseudoscalar  cb\u0305 mesons, respectively.\nNote that,  in our calculation we do not  employ the expansion  m_B_c^*(m_B_c)=m_b+m_c+E_B_c^*(E_B_c) as Refs.\u00a0<cit.> (in Table\u00a0<ref> and Table\u00a0<ref> we will see the influence from the expansion is small), but directly adopt the following physical values\u00a0<cit.> for the cb\u0305 mesons masses:\n\n    m_B_c=6.274 GeV,\u00a0\u00a0 m_B_c^*=6.331 GeV.\n\n\n\nd_v and d_p are matching coefficients between QCD and NRQCD in sub-leading order of relative velocity for the vector  B_c^* meson and pseudoscalar  B_c meson, respectively.\nOne-loop results of d_v and d_p can be found in Refs.\u00a0<cit.>\n\n    d_v=1-\u03b1_s^(n_l)(\u03bc)/\u03c0C_F(x+1)^2/3 x^2-2 x+3(4 /3 +(x-1) (7\n    \tx^2+6 x+7) /4  (x+1)^3ln x+4 ln\u03bc_f ^2/m_b m_c)+\ud835\udcaa(\u03b1_s^2),\n       \n    d_p=1+\u03b1_s^(n_l)(\u03bc)/\u03c0 C_F (x^2+98 x+1/18 (x+1)^2-(x-1) (7 x^2+46 x+7) /12\n    \t(x+1)^3ln x-4/3ln\u03bc_f ^2/m_b m_c)+\ud835\udcaa(\u03b1_s^2).\n\n\nE_B_c^* and   |\u03a8_B_c^*(0)| are  the binding energy and the wave function  at the origin for B_c^*, respectively, while E_B_c and |\u03a8_B_c(0)| are for B_c.   \nIn the previous sections, we have calculated higher-order perturbative corrections to the matching coefficient by extracting the hard contribution using the NRQCD effective theory. Similarly, the  higher-order perturbative corrections to the binding energy and the wave function  at the origin can be calculated allowing for the soft, potential and ultrasoft contributions from the Coulomb potential, non-Coulomb potentials and ultrasoft gluon exchange     using the potential NRQCD effective theory  (pNRQCD)\u00a0<cit.>.\nSince the pseudoscalar meson B_c(1^1S_0) and vector meson B_c^*(1^3S_1) are respectively  the  lowest-lying  spin-singlet and   spin-triplet S-wave bound state, i.e., B_c and B_c^* have different spin quantum  numbers, E_B_c and     |\u03a8_B_c(0)| are slightly different (see Refs.\u00a0<cit.>) from E_B_c^* and |\u03a8_B_c^*(0)|, respectively. \nHowever, the binding energies of the double heavy quark systems are spin-independent  up to NLO (see Refs.\u00a0<cit.>), hence E_B_c^NLO\u2261 E_B_c^*^NLO, which \ncan be obtained from Refs.\u00a0<cit.> as\n\n    E_B_c^NLO\u2261 E_B_c^*^NLO= E^(0){1+\u03b1_s^(n_l)(\u03bc_f) /\u03c0[\u03b2 _0^(n_l)(ln( \u03bc _f/2 m_r C_F \u03b1_s^(n_l)(\u03bc_f))+11/6)-4/3 C_A ]},\n \nwhere  E^(0)=-m_r/2(\u03b1_s^(n_l)(\u03bc_f)C_F)^2,  n_l=3. For simplicity, we have set the pNRQCD factorization scale equal to the NRQCD factorization scale \u03bc_f\u00a0[ This is not a problem because, in strict fixed order computations it is\nnot necessary to distinguish between factorization scales as they all cancel to the required accuracy  once all contributions to an observable are added\u00a0<cit.>.],  which separates contributions coming from the hard and soft momentum regions.   \u03b1_s^(n_l)(\u03bc_f) can be translated into \u03b1_s^(n_l)(\u03bc)  by the coupling running equation in Eq.(<ref>).\nBased on Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), the NLO results in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) are    sufficient  for the N^3LO calculation of the decay constants.\n\nFor phenomenological analysis of the pseudoscalar B_c meson, we will use the approximation  |\u03a8_B_c(0)|\u2248 |\u03a8_B_c^*(0)|, so that the only  missing piece  in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is |\u03a8_B_c^*(0)|. \nIn order to obtain |\u03a8_B_c^*(0)|, we  employ the scale relation explored  by Collins et\u00a0al.\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n    |\u03a8_B_c^*(0)|=|\u03a8_J/\u03c8(0)|^1-y\u00a0|\u03a8_\u03a5(0)|^y,\n\nwhere  y\u2208[0.3,0.4] with the central value y=y_c=ln((1+m_c/m_b)/2)/ln(m_c/m_b)\u00a0[\n\tThe central value y=y_c=ln((1+m_c/m_b)/2)/ln(m_c/m_b)  can be exactly derived from the scale law of the wave function at the origin: |\u03c8_\u03bc^n(0)|^2=f(n,a)(A\u03bc)^3/(2+a) for any reduced mass \u03bc and any class of power-law potentials V(r)=A r^a+C, where f(n,a) is only a function of the radial quantum number n and the power a. \n\tTo cover the uncertainties from various potentials, the maximal (minimal) value of y is simply taken to be 0.4 (0.3) independent of the quark masses. \nFor more details, see Ref.\u00a0<cit.> (where y=0.35 was chosen as the only optimal solution) .] is the scale power. |\u03a8_J/\u03c8(0)| and |\u03a8_\u03a5(0)| are the wave functions at the origin for the vector heavy quarkonia  J/\u03c8 and   \u03a5, respectively.\nFrom literature\u00a0<cit.>,  the full N^3LO  corrections to the wave function at the origin for the lowest-lying vector heavy quarkonium QQ\u0305  can be expressed as \n\n    |\u03a8_QQ\u0305^V(0)|^2/|\u03a8_QQ\u0305^(0)(0)|^2=   1+\u03b1_s^(n_f)(\u03bc_f) /\u03c06 \u03b2^(n_f)_0 L_s+c_\u03c8,1^C/4 \n    +(\u03b1_s^(n_f)(\u03bc_f) /\u03c0)^2 {3/2\u03b2 _0^(n_f)^2 L_s^2\n    \n       \n    +L_s/24[9 \u03b2 _1^(n_f)-18 \u03b2_0^(n_f)^2+12 \u03b2 _0^(n_f)\n    c_\u03c8,1^C+8 \u03c0 ^2 C_F (3 C_A+2 C_F)]\n    \n       \n    +1/144[2 \u03c0 ^2 C_F (162 C_A+89 C_F)+9 c_\u03c8,2^C]\n    }\n       \n    +\n    (\u03b1_s^(n_f)(\u03bc_f) /\u03c0)^3\u03c0 ^2 {\n    C_A^3 [-L_s/4+L_m/4-ln(C_F)-\u03c0 ^2/12+1/2]\n    \n       \n    +C_A^2 C_F [\n    -2/3\tL_s^2+L_s (4/3 L_m+4ln 2+17/18)-L_m^2/6\n       \n    + L_m(31/9-ln 2)\n    +2/9ln(C_F) (9 ln(C_F)+12 ln 2-44)]\n    \n       \n    +C_A C_F^2 [-9/4L_s^2 +L_s (9 /2L_m+4ln\n    2-25/54)-3 /8L_m^2\n    \n       \n    + L_m(61/9-ln  2)\n    +4/3ln(C_F) (4 ln(C_F)+ln 2-10)]\n    \n       \n    +\n    C_A C_F [2 \u03b2_0^(n_f) L_s^2+ L_s/72(\u03b2_0^(n_f)(423-12 \u03c0 ^2) -218 T_F n_f )]\n    \n       \n    +C_F^3 [-3/2 L_s^2+L_s (3 L_m-8 ln\n    2+47/18)-L_m^2/4\n       \n    +L_m(2ln 2+59/36) \n    +8/9ln(C_F) (3 log(C_F)-9 ln 2+2)]\n    \n       \n    +C_F^2 T_F [L_s(2/15-59/27 n_f)\n    +L_m/15]\n    +\u03b2_0^(n_f) C_F^2 [4 /3L_s^2+L_s(53/16-\u03c0\n    \t^2/9) ]\n    \n       \n    +1/\u03c0 ^2[\n    5/4\u03b2_0^(n_f)^3 L_s^3\n    +\u03b2_0^(n_f)L_s^2/32(27 \u03b2_1^(n_f)-54 \u03b2_0^(n_f)^2+20 \u03b2_0^(n_f) c_\u03c8,1^C) \n    \n       \n    + L_s/32(12 \u03b2_0^(n_f)^3-12 \u03b2_1^(n_f)\u03b2_0^(n_f)+3 \u03b2_2^(n_f)-8 \u03b2_0^(n_f)^2 c_\u03c8,1^C.\n       .\n    +4 \u03b2_1^(n_f) c_\u03c8,1^C+5 \u03b2_0^(n_f)\n    c_\u03c8,2^C)\n    \n    +c_\u03c8,3^C+c_\u03c8,3^nC/64]\n    +\u03b4_1^us}+\ud835\udcaa(\u03b1_s^4),\n\nwhere |\u03a8_QQ\u0305^(0)(0)|^2=(m\u03b1_s^(n_f)(\u03bc_f)C_F)^3/(8\u03c0),  L_s=ln[\u03bc_f/(m\u03b1_s^(n_f)(\u03bc_f)C_F)], L_m=ln(\u03bc_f/m), m is the mass of Q, n_f is  flavours   lighter than  Q, and the non-logarithmic terms of the Coulomb, non-Coulomb and ultrasoft corrections read\n\n    c_\u03c8,1^C   = 2.62290 -
