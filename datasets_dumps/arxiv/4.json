As it is well-known, the concept of gravitational radiation\ncan be traced back to 1918 to the study of the linearisation of the\nEinstein field equations around flat spacetime and the derivation of the\ncelebrated quadrupole formula. However, a rigorous formulation of the\nnotion of gravitational radiation had to wait for further development of\nmathematical aspects of the theory put forward by Bondi, Sachs, Newman\nand Penrose and others in the decade of 1960 \u2014see <cit.> for a historical review.  The notion of null-infinity (and\nmore generally the notion of a conformal boundary) developed in the\naforementioned theory proved crucial for the modern understanding of\ngravitational radiation.\n\n\n\nNull-infinity \u2110 corresponds to an idealisation of the\nasymptotic region of the physical spacetime (\u2133\u0303,\n) and it is defined through a conformally related manifold\n(\u2133,) where =\u039e^2 so that\n\u2110 can be identified with the region where \u039e=0 \u2014but\n\u2207_a \u039e\u2260 0.  Unfortunately, the Einstein field equations\n(EFEs) are not conformally invariant so evaluating quantities at\n\u2110 is non-trivial. To circumvent this problem, there are\ndifferent approaches aimed at specific goals. For instance, the\nhyperboloidal approach in their different renditions <cit.>\nrepresents a compromise between the preservation of standard\nformulations of the EFEs used in Numerical Relativity and the inclusion\nof  \u2110 at the expense of dealing with formally singular (but\nnumerically tractable) equations.  On the other hand, there exists\nanother strand of research that stems from taking further the conformal\napproach while insisting on having formally regular equations.  This\nconformally regular approach was initiated in 1981 when H. Friedrich\nderived in <cit.> a reformulation of the Einstein field equations\nknown as the conformal Einstein field equations (CEFEs) \u2014see\n<cit.> for an exhaustive discussion. One of the distincive\nfeatures of the CEFEs is that the conformal factor is a variable, hence\nthe location of the conformal boundary is not fixed a priori. Strategies\nfor fixing the conformal boundary, or scri-fixing, have been\nintroduced for the CEFEs in <cit.> for vacuum and <cit.> for trace-free\nmatter, but they require the existence of a congruence of conformal\ncurves.\n\n\n\nDespite many advances in the mathematical analysis of spacetimes and\nnumerical evolutions with the CEFEs  <cit.>, the application of the CEFEs\nto physical problems has been surprisingly limited. This is evident in\n(and possibly a result of) the fact that the application of linear\nperturbation theory to the CEFEs has not been studied in the existing\nliterature. Such an analysis is needed to make contact with standard\n(linear) metric approaches to characterising gravitational radiation.\nThis article aims to provide a first step in this direction by\nstudying the linearisation of the CEFEs in a form that resembles\nstandard formulations of the linearised Einstein field equations. \n\n\n\nThe core of the CEFEs are the Bianchi identities, which provide a set of\nevolution and constraint equations for the Weyl curvature (coupled with\nother fields in the non-linear case). One approach to the linearised\nproblem concerns the study of the spin-2 equation in a fixed background\nspacetime, which can be thought as the linearisation of the Weyl sector\nof the CEFEs in spinorial form. The spin-2 equation on a particular\nbackground known as the Minkowski i^0-cylinder has been analysed in\n<cit.>.  The spin-2 equation\n\u2207_A'^A\u03d5_ABCD=0, although elegant, looks very different\nto the standard linearisation of metric formulations of the Einstein\nfield equations.  Hence, in this article, we study the linearisation not\nof the original set of CEFEs but rather we start from a metric and\nsecond-order formulation of the CEFEs which is closer in spirit to\nstandard hyperbolic reductions of the EFEs in generalised harmonic gauge\n(GHG) employed in Numerical Relativity. This non-linear wave-like\nformulation of the CEFEs was originally derived in the vacuum case in\n<cit.> and has been extended for the case of trace-free matter in\n<cit.>. In this paper, we linearise these equations around a\ngeneral background and then the solutions to the linearised equations\naround flat spacetime are studied. As a concrete application of the\nlinearisation, we derive, in the far-field approximation,\nquadrupole-like formulae for the conformal fields, obtaining in\nparticular a quadrupole-like formula for the perturbation of the\nrescaled Weyl tensor. As a byproduct, we show how the gauge source\nfunctions can be chosen so that the conformal factor remains\nunperturbed. This can be regarded as a \u201cscri-fixing\u201d strategy for the\nlinearised CEFEs for trace-free matter. We then argue that the same\nstrategy carries over to the non-linear wave-CEFEs in the context of the\nhyperboloidal initial value problem, providing a simpler alternative to\nthe scri-fixing strategy in <cit.> based on conformal\ncurves.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Notations and conventions\n\n\n\nThe signature convention for (Lorentzian) spacetime metrics will be (-,+,+,+). Latin indices from the first half of the alphabet\na,b,c,,... will be used as abstract tensor indices while Greek indices\nwill denote spacetime coordinate indices, taking values from the set\n{0,1,2,3}.  If an adapted coordinate system (with coordinates\nx^\u03bc) is introduced, x^0=t represents the time coordinate, and\nLatin indices from the second half of the alphabet represent spatial\nindices, taking values from the set {1,2,3}. Symmetrisation and\nantisymmetrisation of tensors will be denoted with round and square\nbrackets and taking the trace-free part of a tensor will be denoted by\nadding {} on the relevant indices. For instance T_(ab):=\n12(T_ab + T_ba), T_[ab]:=12(T_ab -\nT_ba) and T_{ab}:= T_ab - 14g_abT.  The curvature\nconventions are fixed by the relation\n\n    (\u2207_a \u2207_b -\u2207_b \u2207_a) v^c = R^c_dab v^d.\n\nAlthough we will occasionally refer to expressions in spinorial form (as\nmuch of the literature on the CEFEs employs spinor notation), all\ncalculations in this article are performed in tensor notation.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Organisation of the paper\n\n\n\nSection <ref> gives a brief summary of the CEFEs and the\nwave-like hyperbolic reduction of <cit.>. This is included to\ngive a concise reference to the reader and to provide the non-linear\ncontext of the equations studied in this paper.  Section\n<ref> contains the linearisation of the wave-CEFEs\nin GHG around a general background.  Section <ref>\nparticularises the equations for a flat background and discusses the\nperturbed solutions via Green's functions methods and, in the far-field\napproximation, quadrupole-like formulae for the conformal fields are\nderived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE CONFORMAL EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conformal Einstein field equations (CEFEs) are a reformulation of\nthe Einstein field equations (EFEs) with the aim of dynamically\nimplementing R. Penrose's conformal approach. The CEFEs were originally\nintroduced in <cit.> and encode a set of differential conditions\nsatisfied by the geometry of a conformal extension (\u2133,)\nof a spacetime (\u2133\u0303,) (with\n=\u039e^2) satisfying the EFEs. To differentiate between\nthese two, the pair (\u2133,) is called the unphysical\nspacetime while the pair (\u2133\u0303,) is called\nthe physical spacetime.  The feature that distinguishes the CEFEs\nfrom other reformulations of the EFEs is that (for trace-free matter)\nthe CEFEs are formally regular at \u039e=0 \u2014see\n<cit.>. To see this and concisely introduce the\nCEFEs, it is convenient to define the following zero-quantities\n\u2014see <cit.> for an extensive discussion:\n\n\n    Z_ab := \u2207_a\u2207_b\u039e +\u039e L_ab - s g_ab -\n      1/2\u039e^3T_{ab}=0 ,\n      \n           Z_a := \u2207_as +L_ac\u2207 ^c\u039e -\n     1/2\u039e^2T_{ab}\u2207^b\u039e -\n     1/6\u039e^3\u2207^bT_{ba}=0 , \n          \u03b4_bac := \u2207_aL_bc-\u2207_bL_ac -\n     d^d_cab\u2207_d\u039e -\u039e T_abc =0 ,\n     \n          \u03bb_abc:=\n     \u2207_ed^e_abc-T_bca=0 , \n           P^c_dab :=  R^c_dab - \u039e d^c_dab - \n     2( \u03b4^c_[aL_b]d -\n       g_d[aL_b]^c).\n     \n           Z := \u03bb - 6 \u039e s + 3 \u2207_a\u039e\u2207^a\u039e\n     -1/4\u039e^4T=0\n           M_a:=\u2207^bT_ba - \u039e^-1T\u2207_a\u039e=0.\n\n\nwhere \u039e is the conformal factor, s is the Friedrich scalar,\nL_ab is the Schouten tensor, R^a_bcd is the Riemann\ntensor, d^a_bcd is the rescaled Weyl tensor, T_ab is\nthe rescaled energy-momentum tensor with trace T:=g^abT_ab\nand T_abc is the rescaled Cotton tensor. The zero-quantities\nZ_ab, Z_a, \u03b4_abc,\u03bb_abc , Z and M_a are defined\nsimply as a bookkeeping device in the sense that the CEFEs are satisfied\nwhen a collection of fields\n\n    {g_ab,  \u039e,   s ,L_ab,  d_abcd,  T_ab,   T_abc}\n\nsolve the equations\n\n    Z_ab=0,    Z_a=0,   \u03b4_abc=0,   \u03bb_abc=0,     P^d_abc=0,    Z=0,    M_a=0.\n\n\n\n   Observe that the only singular terms in the zero-quantities\n  (<ref>) appear with the trace of the unphysical\n  energy-momentum tensor, specifically in equation\n  (<ref>). However for trace-free\n  matter all the equations implied by the zero-quantities\n  (<ref>) are formally regular at \u039e=0. \n\n\n\nThe geometric variables are defined via\n\n    s   := 14\u2207_a\u2207^a\u039e +\n      124R\u039e,\n     L_ab   :=12R_ab-112Rg_ab,\n      \n     d^a_bcd   :=\u039e^-1C^a_bcd.\n\nwhere R_ab and R denote the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar of\n(\u2133,) while C^a_bcd is the conformally invariant\nWeyl tensor. Given a solution to the CEFEs, it can be verified that the\nassociated physical metric g\u0303_ab=\u039e^-2g_ab will satisfy\nthe Einstein field equations:\n\n    R\u0303_ab-1/2R\u0303g\u0303_ab + \u03bbg\u0303_ab= T\u0303_ab ,\n \nwhere T\u0303_ab is the physical energy-momentum tensor, \u03bb\nis the cosmological constant, and R\u0303_ab and R\u0303 are\nthe respective Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar. The matter variables in\n(<ref>) are related to their physical counterparts\nas:\n\n    T_ab    :=\u039e^-2T\u0303_ab,      T:=\u039e^-4T\u0303,\n          T\u0303:=g\u0303^abT\u0303_ab ,\n      \n    \n      T_abc    :=\u039e^-1\u2207\u0303_[aT\u0303_b]c\n      -1/3\u039e^-1g\u0303_c[b\u2207\u0303_a]T\u0303 .\n\nHere T\u0303_ab is the physical energy-momentum tensor and\n\u2207\u0303 is the Levi-Civita connection of g\u0303_ab. A\ncomprehensive discussion and derivation of the CEFEs can be found in\n<cit.>.\n\n\n\n   Though the conceptually clean setup is the vaccum case, we\n  include matter primarily for the purpose of deriving quadrupole-like formulae in subsection <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  From this point onward, it will be assumed that only trace-free\n  matter models are in consideration. Notice that the conditions T=0\n  and T_{ab}=T_ab simplify some of the matter terms in the\n  zero-quantities (<ref>).\n  \n\n\n\nWe now consider some properties of the rescaled Cotton tensor under the\ntrace-free matter assumption. Under this assumption, the rescaled Cotton\ntensor can be written in terms of the unphysical energy-momentum tensor\nas\n\n    T_abc    :=\u039e\u2207_[aT_b]c\n      + 3 T_c[b\u2207_a]\u039e -g_c[aT_b]e\u2207^e\u039e .\n\nObserve as well that the Cotton tensor has the symmetries\nT_abc=T_[ab]c and T_[abc]=0. Furthermore, the trace-free\nassumption and \u2207\u0303^aT\u0303_ab=0 implies that\n\n    \u2207^aT_ab=0,     \u2207_cT_ab^c     = 0.\n\nAdditionally, using again equations (<ref>),\n(<ref>)\n and  exploiting Z_ab=0 gives\n\n    \u2207 _aT_b^a_c =   \n      - 12\u039e\u2207 _a\u2207 ^aT_bc\n      - (4 s - 13\u039e  R)T_bc  +  \u039e ^3 T_b^a T_ca\n      - 12\u039e ^2 T^ad d_bacd  \n       - 14\u039e ^3 T_ad T^ad g_bc\n       \n      + \u2207 ^a\u039e  (-2 \u2207 _aT_bc +  \u2207 _(bT_c)a).\n\n\n\n\n  The Ricci scalar R is not determined by the CEFEs and in fact, it\n  encodes the conformal gauge freedom. Given two conformal extensions of\n  the same physical spacetime  =\u039e^2 and\n  =\u039e\u030c^2 one has that\n  =\u03f0^2 with \u03f0 := \u039e\u030c/\u039e\n  and \u03f0\u2243\ud835\udcaa(1) at the conformal boundary.\n  Hence, their Ricci scalars are related via\n  \n    6 \u2207_a \u2207^a \u03f0 -R \u03f0 =- \u0158\u03f0^3.\n\n  Observe that if \u0158 is considered as a given scalar function in\n  (\u2133,) then, this equation can always be solved locally\n  for \u03f0. Thus, the Ricci scalar in the CEFEs is a gauge\n  quantity that is called the conformal gauge source function\n  \u2014see <cit.> for further discussion.\n  \n\n\n\nIn this article, we will adhere to the metric formulation of the CEFEs\nwhich consists of using the definition of the Schouten tensor to obtain\n an equation for the metric. Namely, from\n\n    R_ab=2L_ab + 1/6Rg_ab,\n\none substitutes the expression for the Ricci tensor as second\nderivatives of the metric respect to some coordinate basis x^\u03bc and\nreads L_\u03bc\u03bd as a source term in the resulting equation. The\nsource term L_\u03bc\u03bd is then coupled to the rest of the variables\nvia equations (<ref>).\n\n\n\n  \n   In view that the Ricci scalar is the conformal gauge source function,\n   to have a clean split between gauge quantities and non-gauge\n   quantities one could opt for using the trace-free Ricci tensor as\n   variable instead of L_ab,\n  \n    \u03a6_ab := 1/2(R_ab - 1/4Rg_ab).\n\n  The factor 1/2 in its definition is conventional and it is put so\n  that \u03a6_ab corresponds to the tensorial counterpart of the\n  trace-free Ricci spinor \u03a6_AA'BB' of the Newman-Penrose\n  formalism. In this case, the evolution equation for the metric is read\n  of from\n  \n    R_ab=2\u03a6_ab + 1/4Rg_ab.\n\n  For convenience, we employ such a splitting, and will use the\n  trace-free Ricci tensor rather than the Schouten tensor as a dynamical\n  variable.\n  \n\n\n\nThere are different hyperbolic reduction strategies to turn the\ntensorial expressions (<ref>) into partial\ndifferential equations.  In the next section, we revisit a hyperbolic\nreduction that is most appropriate for the aims of this article. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Geometric wave equations\n\n\n\n\nA first derivation of the metric conformal Einstein field equations as a\nset of wave equations was given in <cit.> for the vacuum case and\nin <cit.> for the case of trace-free matter. Our discussion\ndiffers in the use of the trace-free Ricci tensor instead of the Schouten\ntensor; we do this to make transparent the split between gauge and\nnon-gauge quantities. Since we only make a simple variable change, the\nderivation will not be repeated here. The geometric wave equations read\n\n\n    \u25a1\u039e  = 4 s - 16\u039e R ,\n       \u25a1 s = \u039e\u03a6 _ab\u03a6 ^ab\n      - 16\u2207 _aR \u2207 ^a\u039e\n      - 16 s R + (R12)^2 \u039e\n      + 14\u039e ^5 T_ab T^ab\n      - \u039e ^3 T^ab\u03a6 _ab\n      + \u039e  T_ab\u2207 ^a\u039e\u2207 ^b\u039e,\n      \n      \n       \u25a1\u03a6_ab = 4 \u03a6 _a^c\u03a6 _bc\n      - \u03a6 _cd\u03a6 ^cd g_ab\n      -2 \u039e\u03a6 ^cd d_acbd + 13\u03a6 _ab R\n      + 16\u2207 _b\u2207 _aR\n      - 124 g_ab\u25a1 R \n                                             \n      +   12\u039e ^3 T^dc d_adbc\n      - \u039e\u2207 _cT_b^c_a\n      - 2T_(a|c|b)\u2207 ^c\u039e,\n      \n      \n       \u25a1 d_abcd =  12 d_abcd R\n      + 2 \u039e  d_a^e_d^p d_becp\n      -2 \u039e  d_a^e_c^p d_bedp\n      -2 \u039e  d_ab^ep d_cedp\n              - \u039e^2T_[c^ed_d]eab\n      - \u039e^2T_[a^ed_b]ecd\n      + \u039e^2T^ep( d_aep[cg_d]b - d_bep[cg_d]a )\n      + 2 \u2207_[aT_|cd|b]\n                                           \n        +2 \u2207_[cT_|ab|d]+ 2 g_d[b\u2207_|eT_c|^e_a]\n        + 2 g_c[a\u2207_|eT_d|^e_b],\n\n\nwhere \u25a1=\u2207_a\u2207^a denotes the geometric wave\noperator.

When recast in this form, the original set\nof equations (<ref>) form constraints on initial\ndata; the propagation of the constraints was shown in\n<cit.>.

To give\n  a concise and general discussion, the wave equations for the matter\n  fields will not be presented as this is a case-dependent analysis and\n  can be revisited for a number of trace-free matter models in\n  <cit.>.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Wave equation for metric\n\n\n\nThe wave equation for the metric is derived from the expression of the\ntrace-free Ricci tensor in some fiduciary coordinate system x^\u03bc.\nHere and in what follows, \u0393^\u03bc_\u03b1\u03b2 will denote the\nChristoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection \u2207 of  in\nthe coordinate basis x^\u03bc.

Recall that \u0393^\u03bc =\n- \u2207_\u03b1\u2207^\u03b1x^\u03bc so that setting C^\u03bc=0 is\nequivalent to imposing the generalised harmonic gauge condition\n\n    \u2207_\u03b1\u2207^\u03b1x^\u03bc= \u210b^\u03bc.\n\nwith the above definitions, the reduced Ricci tensor\n\u211b_\u03bc\u03bd is defined as\n\n    \u211b_\u03bc\u03bd:=R_\u03bc\u03bd - \u2207_(\u03bcC_\u03bd).\n\nA customary calculation \u2014see for instance <cit.>\u2014 shows that the reduced Ricci tensor can be\nexpressed in terms of derivatives of the metric as\n\n    \u211b _\u03bc\u03bd = - 12 g_\u03bc\u03bd -\n      \u2207 _(\u03bc\u210b_\u03bd)  + g^\u03c3\u03b4g^\u03b1\u03b2\n      (\u0393_\u03bd\u03b4\u03b2\u0393_\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 +\n      2\u0393_\u03b4\u03bd\u03b2\u0393_(\u03bc\u03bd) \u03b1 )\n\nwhere := g^\u03b1\u03b2\u2202_\u03b1\u2202_\u03b2 is\nthe standard reduced wave operator.  Similarly, recalling that\nthe Ricci scalar of  encodes the conformal gauge freedom, one\nintroduces\n\n    C := R - F\n\nwhere F is the conformal gauge source function.  Imposing the\nconstraint C=0 is equivalent to choosing a representative from the\nconformal class [] in the same way that imposing C^\u03bc=0 is\nequivalent to choosing the coordinates to satisfy equation\n(<ref>) \u2014see Remark\u00a0<ref>.\nTherefore, using equation (<ref>) and imposing the\nGHG-coordinate and conformal gauge constraints\n\n    C^\u03bc=0,      C=0,\n\nwe obtain the following reduced wave equation for the components of the\nunphysical metric in the x^\u03bc coordinates:\n\n    g_\u03bc\u03bd = - 4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd - 1/2F g_\u03bc\u03bd - 2\n    \u2207 _(\u03bc\u210b_\u03bd)  - g^\u03c3\u03b4g^\u03b1\u03b2\n    (\u0393_\u03bd\u03b4\u03b2\u0393_\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 +\n    2\u0393_\u03b4\u03bd\u03b2\u0393_(\u03bc\u03bd) \u03b1 ).\n\nOne can perform a similar procedure on the remaining wave equations\n(<ref>) to obtain them in their reduced form, but since it is\nnot absolutely necessary for the discussion that follows, that\ndiscussion is provided in Appendix <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7  THE CONFORMAL EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATIONS IN THE LINEAR \n  APPROXIMATION \n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section the linearisation of the wave equations (<ref>)\nis obtained. To set up the notation regarding linearisation, first, we\noutline the general procedure. Consider a one-parameter family of fields\n\u03d5(\u03b5) which satisfy an equation\n\n    \u2130\u03d5(\u03b5)=0,\n\nwhere \u2130 is some (non-linear) differential operator.  Then,\nthe field \u03d5:=\u03d5(0) will be called the background\nsolution as it satisfies the equation \u2130\u03d5=0.\nLet D denote the linearisation operator:\n\n    D(\u2130\u03d5):=d/d\u03b5(\u2130\u03d5(\u03b5))|_\u03b5=0\n\nThen, using that  D\u03d5=0, one obtains\n\u2112\u03b4\u03d5=0 where \u2112 is a linear operator\nacting on \u03b4\u03d5:=\nd\u03d5/d\u03b5|_\u03b5=0. Issues of linearisation\nstability (the existence and correspondence between exact and linearised\nsolutions) will not be addressed here.\n\n\n\nFor the ongoing discussion \u03d5 = (\u03c6, ), where\n\u03c6 encodes all the geometric variables while  and \nrespectively encode the gauge and matter variables. Namely, for the\ngeometric sector \u03c6, one is considering an approximate\nsolution of the form\n\n    g_\u03bc\u03bd=g_\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd,     \u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd= \u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd,\n          \u039e = \u039e + \u03b4\u039e,      s= s +\n      \u03b4 s\n\nFor the gauge sector  one has the split\n\n    F=F + \u03b4 F,     \u210b_\u03bc = \u210b_\u03bc \n      + \u03b4\u210b_\u03bc.\n\nFor the matter sector  one has the split\n\n    T_\u03bc\u03bd=T_\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b4 T_\u03bc\u03bd,      \n      T_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1 = T_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1 \n        + \u03b4 T_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1.\n\nFrom this point forward (unless otherwise stated), indices will be\nraised and lowered with the background metric g_\u03bc\u03bd.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Equation for the metric perturbation\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the advantages of the wave formulation of the CEFEs is that the\nmetric sector of the equations resembles conventional formulations of\nGeneral Relativity. This can be seen clearly even in the non-linear\nequation (<ref>) where this equation is formally\nidentical to the standard (non-conformal) Einstein field equations in\ngeneralised harmonic gauge with a source term in this case given by\n-4\u03a6_ab-1/2Fg_ab which could be thought conceptually as\nsome artificial \u201cgeometric matter term\u201d. To exploit the latter\nviewpoint let us define\n\n    \ud835\udcb2_ab:=2\u03a6_ab + 1/4Fg_ab,\n\nso that equation (<ref>) agnostically reads:\n\n    R_ab=\ud835\udcb2_ab.\n\nExpressing the equation for the metric in this way is advantageous since\none can follow the classical discussion for linearising the Einstein\nfield equations with respect to a general background g_ab\n\u2014see for instance Sec. 7.5 of <cit.>.  Since a few gauge\ntransformations are needed and we want to reserve the symbol \u03b4\ng_\u03bc\u03bd for the last transformation, we first decompose the metric\nas g_\u03bc\u03bd=g_\u03bc\u03bd + h_\u03bc\u03bd. Then, a\nstraightforward linearisation of equation (<ref>) gives\n\n    \u25a1 h_\u03bc\u03bd =\n      - 2 \u03b4\ud835\udcb2_\u03bc\u03bd \n      + ^\u03b1\u03b2 _\u03b2 _\u03bch_\u03bd\u03b1 \n      + ^\u03b1\u03b2 _\u03b2 _\u03bdh_\u03bc\u03b1 \n      - ^\u03b1\u03b2 _\u03bc _\u03bdh_\u03b1\u03b2\n\nwhere \u25a1 :=\n\u2207_\u03bc\u2207^\u03bc with \u2207\ndenoting the Levi-Civita connection of . Then, upon\ncommuting covariant derivatives and defining the trace-reversed metric\nperturbation \u0125_\u03bc\u03bd:=h_\u03bc\u03bd-1/2\nh_\u03b1^\u03b1_\u03bc\u03bd, we obtain\n \n  \u25a1\u0125 _\u03bc\u03bd     = -2 \u03b4\ud835\udcb2_\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b4\ud835\udcb2_\u03b1^\u03b1\n  g_\u03bc\u03bd -2 R_\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2\n  \u0125^\u03b1\u03b2 + 2 R_(\u03bd^\u03b1\n  \u0125_\u03bc) \u03b1 - g_\u03bc\u03bd _\u03b2_\u03b1 \u0125^\u03b1\u03b2 + 2_(\u03bc_|\u03b1| \u0125_\u03bd) ^\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03b4\ud835\udcb2_\u03b1^\u03b1:=^\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4\ud835\udcb2_\u03b1\u03b2, and R_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 and\nR_\u03bc\u03bd are the Riemann and Ricci tensors of\n, which can be written in terms of the rescaled Weyl\ntensor and trace-free Ricci tensors via the decomposition:\n\n    R_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 = \n      \u039ed_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\n       -2 \u03a6 _\u03b2  [\u03bcg_\u03bd] \u03b1\n       +2 \u03a6 _\u03b1 [\u03bcg_\u03bd]  \u03b2\n       + 112R (g_\u03bc\u03b1g_\u03bd\u03b2\n       - g_\u03bc\u03b2g_\u03bd\u03b1).\n\nTo avoid unnecessarily long expressions, background curvature terms will\nnot be expanded out. Notice that equation (<ref>)\ncontains only divergences of \u0125_\u03bc\u03bd and derivatives of the\ntrace are absent. To obtain hyperbolic equations, the divergence terms\n_\u03b1\u0125_\u03bd^\u03b1 are removed by\nemploying a slight generalisation of the procedure outlined in\n<cit.>; one begins by recognising that the quantity q_\u03bc\u03bd :=\nh_\u03bc\u03bd + 2_(\u03bc\u03be_\u03bd) is a gauge transformation of\nthe metric perturbation h_\u03bc\u03bd. Introduce its trace-reversed\nversion \n\u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd=q\u0302_\u03bc\u03bd:=\nq_\u03bc\u03bd-12q_c^cg_\u03bc\u03bd.\nSince the vector field \u03be_\u03bd is arbitrary, one can choose a gauge\nin which \u03be_\u03bd satisfies an inhomogeneous wave equation. In\nparticular, the divergence of \u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd:\n\n    _\u03bd\u03b4 g_\u03bc^\u03bd =  F_\u03bc,\n\nmay be rewritten as the following wave equation:\n\n    \u25a1\u03be_\u03bc + R_\u03bc\u03bd\u03be^\u03bd +\n      _\u03bd\u0125_\u03bc^\u03bd =  F_\u03bc ,\n\nwhere F_\u03bc is a given set of functions of the coordinates\nx^\u03b1 and the evolved fields (but not their derivatives), which\nwe call the Lorenz gauge source functions.  These are related to\nthe linearisation of the coordinate gauge source functions\n\u210b^\u03bc as discussed in Remark <ref>.  If\n\u03be_\u03bd satisfies the above wave equation, then \u03b4\ng_\u03bc\u03bd satisfies the gauge (<ref>). The\ngauge condition in (<ref>) is a linear analogue\nof the generalised harmonic gauge condition, and as such we called it\nthe generalised Lorenz gauge \u2014a similar definition is given\nalso in <cit.> in the non-conformal context\nassuming a flat background.  Working in the generalised Lorenz gauge,\nwe obtain the following equation for the metric perturbation:\n\n  \u25a1 \u03b4g_\u03bc\u03bd     = \n  - 2 \u03b4\ud835\udcb2_\u03bc\u03bd \n  + \u03b4\ud835\udcb2^\u03b1_\u03b1\n  g_\u03bc\u03bd\n  - 2 R_\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 \n      \u03b4g^\u03b1\u03b2\n  + 2 R^\u03b1_(\u03bd \u03b4g_\u03bc)  \u03b1\n  - _\u03bc\u03bd _\u03b1F^\u03b1\n  + 2 _(\u03bcF_\u03bd)   \n\nsubject to the gauge condition (<ref>).\n\n\n \n  The analogy between the Lorenz and Harmonic gauge is more subtle\n  when dealing with a non-flat background since the direct linearisation\n  of the generalised harmonic condition C^\u03bc:=\u0393^\u03bc +\n  \u210b^\u03bc=0 renders\n  \n    \u03b4 C^\u03bc=\n      _\u03b2\u03b4 g^\u03b2\u03bc \n        - \u210b^\u03b1\u03b4 g^\u03bc_\u03b1 \n        - \u0393^\u03bc_\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4 g^\u03b1\u03b2 + \n         \u03b4\u210b^\u03bc =0.\n\n  Comparing equations (<ref>) and\n  (<ref>) one concludes that :\n  \n    F^\u03bc = \u210b^\u03b1\u03b4 g^\u03bc_\u03b1 \n        + \u0393^\u03bc_\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4 g^\u03b1\u03b2 \n        - \u03b4\u210b^\u03bc .\n\n  Observe that even for the harmonic case \u210b^\u03bc =\n  \u03b4\u210b^\u03bc=0 equation (<ref>) reduces to\n  \n    _\u03b2\u03b4 g^\u03b2\u03bc =\n        \u0393^\u03bc_\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4 g^\u03b1\u03b2,\n\n  retrieving the Lorenz gauge condition only if the background\n  connection vanishes \u0393^\u03bc_\u03b1\u03b2=0.\n  \n\n\n\nTo complete the discussion now we look at the expression for \u03b4\ud835\udcb2_\u03bc\u03bd.  It follows from the definition of\n\ud835\udcb2_ab in equation (<ref>) that\n\n    \u03b4\ud835\udcb2_\u03bc\u03bd = 2 \u03b4\u03a6 _\u03bc\u03bd \n      + 14F\u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd \n      - 18F\u03b4 g^\u03b1_\u03b1_\u03bc\u03bd \n      +  14\u03b4 F _\u03bc\u03bd.\n\nRecalling that the conformal gauge constraint has been imposed C:= R -\nF=0, observe that the linearisation of this condition leads to the\nfollowing constraint:\n\n    \u03b4 C = \n      \u03b4\ud835\udcb2^\u03bc_\u03bc \n      - R^\u03bc\u03bd\u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd \n      + 12R\u03b4 g^\u03bc_\u03bc \n      - \u03b4 F =0.\n\nFor consistency, the background conformal gauge source function and the\nbackground Ricci scalar should be identified:\nR=F.  Then, with this identification and using\nequations (<ref>) the linearisation of the conformal\nconstraint reads\n\n    \u03b4 C = 2\u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc^\u03bc -2 \u03a6^\u03bc\u03bd\u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd=0.\n\nThe latter equation states that although \u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd is trace-free,\nin general, its perturbation may not be. Nonetheless, the trace of the\nperturbation is fixed by equation (<ref>).  In\nparticular, notice that if the background is flat, this condition\nreduces to \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc^\u03bc=0.\n\nTo obtain the final expression for the metric perturbation equation is\nthen enough to substitute equation (<ref>) into equation\n(<ref>).  Although the resulting equation for \u03b4\ng_\u03bc\u03bd looks more complicated than the usual expression for the\nmetric perturbation this is mainly because the linearisation was\nperformed with respect to a general background and due to the use of the\ngeneralised Lorenz gauge. Later on, when the background is fixed the\nexpressions presented in this section will simplify considerably.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Equations for the perturbation of other conformal fields\n\n\n\nThe linearisation of the rest of the conformal fields can be obtained\nsystematically.  The main calculation involves obtaining a suitable\nexpression for the linearisation of the geometric wave operator acting\non each of the conformal fields.  To do the calculation in the scalar\nsector, first notice that for a scalar field \u03c6 one has that\n\n    D\u25a1\u03c6 = \u25a1\u03b4\u03c6\n      - h^\u03bd\u03bc _\u03bd_\u03bc\u03c6\n      - ^\u03bc\u03b1 _\u03b1h_\u03bd\u03bc ^\u03bd\u03c6\n      + 12^\u03bc\u03b1\n      _\u03bdh_\u03bc\u03b1 ^\u03bd\u03c6\n\nwhere \u03c6 denotes a background quantity and \u03b4\u03c6 the perturbation. Performing the same gauge transformations of\nsubsection <ref> for the metric perturbation h_\u03bc\u03bd\nand imposing the generalised Lorenz gauge one obtains:\n\n    D \u25a1\u03c6 = \u25a1\u03b4\u03c6 +\n      12\u03b4 g^\u03bc_\u03bc\u25a1\u03c6\n      - \u03b4 g^\u03bc\u03bd _\u03bd _\u03bc\u03c6\n      - F^\u03bc _\u03bc\u03c6.\n\nA direct calculation using the latter expression and exploiting that the\nbackground fields \u03d5 satisfy the CEFEs in the form of\nequations (<ref>) as well as equations\n(<ref>), give the following equation for the\nperturbation of the conformal factor\n\n    \u25a1\u03b4\u039e  =  \n      - 16F\u03b4\u039e\n      - 16\u03b4 F\n      + 4 \u03b4 s \n      -  ^\u03bc\u03bd\u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd\n      +( 124F \n      - s )\u03b4 g^\u03bc_\u03bc \n      + F^\u03bc _\u03bc\n      + 12 ^3 ^\u03bc\u03bd\u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd\n\nA similar calculation gives the linearised wave equation for the\nFriedrich scalar. The explicit expression is lengthy and has been put in\nAppendix <ref>. For tensor fields the calculation is slightly\nmore involved.

The semicolon separates the arguments\nwhich do not contain the evolved perturbation variables explicitly.\nObserve that only the equation for \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd contains\nsecond derivatives of \u03b4 F which restricts the allowed choices for\n\u03b4 F\u2014see Remark <ref>. The expressions\nfor H^g_\u03bc\u03bd, and H^\u039e are given in the respective\nequations (<ref>) and (<ref>).\nThe expressions for H^s, H^\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd and\nH^d_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 are lengthy and are given explicitly in\nAppendix <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ANALYSIS OF WAVE SOLUTIONS AROUND FLAT SPACETIME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Fixing the background solution\n\n\n\nThe discussion given in the last section is general in the sense that\nneither the background solution \u03d5 nor the gauge\nsource functions  have been fixed.  The first observation to be\nmade is that, although the expression for H^d_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is\ncomplicated, in fact, if one restricts the analysis to the vacuum\ncase and a conformally flat background (so that\nd_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2=0 but \u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd\u2260\n0 and R\u2260 0), then the equation for the perturbation of\nthe rescaled Weyl tensor reduces to\n\n    \u25a1 \u03b4 d_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\n      = 1/2F\u03b4 d_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2,\n\nand this equation decouples from the rest.  This is to be expected since\nas one way to study linearised gravity is through the spin-2 equation\nfor which the metric perturbation plays no role \u2014see <cit.>. Since the aim of this article is to give a first analysis\ninto the linearised version of the CEFEs, it is relevant to now examine\nthe complete system even if some of the equations decouple as in the\ncase described above.\n\nThe simplest choice of background is one in which the background\ngeometry is flat. Naively, one would think that this forces the\nbackground conformal factor to be constant, \u039e=1, and the\nequations trivialise to the standard non-conformal case; this would\ndefeat the purpose of considering the CEFEs in the first place, as one\nwould not be able to incorporate the conformal boundary\nin such an analysis. Fortunately, there\nexists a non-trivial conformal transformation that maps the Minkowski\nspacetime into itself such that spatial infinity and null infinity for\nthe physical Minkowski spacetime are respectively mapped to the\norigin and the lightcone through the origin of the (conformally\ntransformed) unphysical Minkowski spacetime. The evaluation of\nthe field at the conformal boundary of the physical spacetime\ncorresponds to evaluation at finite coordinate locations in the\nunphysical spacetime.  We point out that such a conformal transformation\ndoes not necessarily yield a full compactification, as some points (such\nas the physical origin) are mapped to infinity \u2014see Figure\n<ref>.  This choice for a flat background, which we call the\ninversion representation of the Minkowski spacetime, is the\nsimplest non-trivial case (in the sense that it can incorporate the\nconformal boundary) that one can analyse in the conformal set-up.\nTherefore, the following analysis can be regarded as the conformal\ncounterpart of the standard discussion of linearised (physical) Einstein\nfield equations around flat spacetime. The inversion representation of\nthe Minkowski spacetime is a compelling choice not only for its\nsimplicity, but also because it is related to the\ni^0-cylinder representation of the Minkowski spacetime\n(see for instance <cit.>) which has\nd_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2=0, R = 0 with a\nnon-trivial trace-free Ricci tensor \u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd\u2260 0.\nWhile an analysis on the i^0-cylinder background\nwould be of great interest, the sources  in\nthe equations for the fields other than \u03b4 d_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\n(see Appendix <ref>) become cumbersome when\n\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd\u2260 0; this will be pursued in future work.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The inversion conformal representation of the Minkowski spacetime\n\n\n\n\nThe inversion representation of the Minkowski spacetime described in the\npreceding paragraph is a standard conformal representation detailed in\n<cit.>, which we now\nsummarise. In what follows (\u211d^4, ) will denote\nthe (physical) Minkowski spacetime.  Let x\u0303^\u03bc\u0303=\n(t\u0303,x\u0303^\u0129), represent physical Cartesian\ncoordinates.  The associated coordinate basis vectors and covectors are\ndenoted by \u2202_\u03bc\u0303 and\n\ud835\udc1dx\u0303^\u03bc\u0303, respectively. The components of an\narbitrary abstract tensor S_ab in the physical Cartesian coordinate\nbasis are denoted by S_\u03bc\u0303\u03bd\u0303. The Minkowski metric\nreads \n\n    =\n    \u03b7_\u03bc\u0303\u03bd\u0303\ud835\udc1dx\u0303^\u03bc\u0303\u2297\ud835\udc1dx\u0303^\u03bd\u0303,\n\nwhere\u00a0\u03b7\u0303_\u03bc\u0303\u03bd\u0303=diag(-1,1,1,1).\nDefining the physical radial coordinate via\u00a0\u03c1\u0303^2=\n\u03b4_\u0129j\u0303x\u0303^\u0129x\u0303^j\u0303\nwhere\u00a0\u03b4_\u0129j\u0303=diag(1,1,1) and considering\nan arbitrary choice of coordinates on\u00a0\ud835\udd4a^2 the physical\nMinkowski metric can be written as\n\n    =-\ud835\udc1dt\u0303\u2297\ud835\udc1dt\u0303\n    +\ud835\udc1d\u03c1\u0303\u2297\ud835\udc1d\u03c1\u0303+\u03c1\u0303^2\n    \u03c3,\n\nwith\u00a0t\u0303\u2208(-\u221e, \u221e), \u03c1\u0303\u2208 [0,\u221e)\nwhere\u00a0\u03c3 denotes the standard metric on\u00a0\ud835\udd4a^2. \n\nWe now introduce the unphysical Cartesian coordinates\nx^\u03bc=(t,x^i), and denote the associated vector and covector basis\nwith \u2202_\u03bc and \ud835\udc1dx^\u03bc, respectively. As\nbefore, the components of an arbitrary tensor S_ab in the unphysical\nCartesian coordinate basis will be denoted as S_\u03bc\u03bd. The\nrelationship between the physical and unphysical Cartesian coordinates\nis given by:\n\n    x^\u03bc\n    =\n    \u03b4_\u03bc\u0303^\u03bc x\u0303^\u03bc\u0303/X\u0303^2, \n        X\u0303^2 \n    \u2261\u03b7\u0303_\u03bc\u0303\u03bd\u0303x\u0303^\u03bc\u0303x\u0303^\u03bd\u0303,\n    \n    x\u0303^\u03bc\u0303=\u03b4^\u03bc\u0303_\u03bc x^\u03bc/X^2,\n        \n    X^2=\u03b7_\u03bc\u03bdx^\u03bcx^\u03bd.\n\nwhere \u03b4_\u03bc\u0303^\u03bc=diag(1,1,1,1),\nX^2=1/X\u0303^2 and \u03b7_\u03bc\u03bd=diag(-1,1,1,1). This\ncoordinate transformation is valid in the complement of the lightcone at\nthe origin in the physical Minkowski spacetime where X\u0303^2 > 0.\n\n\n\n   The notational reason for having a tilde over the physical\n  coordinate indices is to distinguish the physical and unphysical\n  coordinate bases denoted by \u2202_\u03bc and\n  \u2202_\u03bc\u0303.  The latter requires the use of\n  \u03b4_\u03bc\u0303^\u03bc in the expressions\n  (<ref>) to keep the tilded and\n  untilded indices balanced. This notation is inspired by that of the\n  dual foliation formalism of <cit.>.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFrom the relation between the physical and the (unphysical) inversion\ncoordinate bases one can construct the Jacobians\n\n    J_\u03bc\u0303^\u03bc:= \n        \u2202 x^\u03bc/\u2202x\u0303^\u03bc\u0303\n        =\n        X\u0303^-2(\u03b4_\u03bc\u0303^\u03bc\n        - 2 x^\u03bcx\u0303_\u03bc\u0303),      \n       J_\u03bc^\u03bc\u0303:=\n       \u2202x\u0303^\u03bc\u0303/\u2202 x^\u03bc=\n        X^-2\n          (\u03b4^\u03bc\u0303_\u03bc-2x\u0303^\u03bc\u0303x_\u03bc)\n\nTo identify a suitable conformal metric, it is enough to compute\n\u03b7_\u03bc\u03bd\ud835\udc1dx^\u03bc\u2297\ud835\udc1dx^\u03bd =\n \u03b7_\u03bc\u03bd\n  J_\u03bc\u0303^\u03bcJ_\u03bd\u0303^\u03bd\ud835\udc1dx\u0303^\u03bc\u0303\u2297\ud835\udc1dx\u0303^\u03bd\u0303.\nIntroducing  \u03b7=\u03b7_\u03bc\u03bd\ud835\udc1dx^\u03bc\u2297\ud835\udc1dx^\u03bd, we write this compactly as:\n\n    \u03b7=\u039e^2 ,\n\nwith \u039e =X^2. This demonstrates that the inversion (unphysical)\nMinkowski spacetime can be recast as a conformal transformation of the\nphysical Minkowski spacetime.  Although, in most of the upcoming\ndiscussion, all tensor components will be expressed in just one\ncoordinate basis (the unphysical one), notice that, the relation\nbetween the components of a tensor S_ab in the physical and the\nunphysical bases is then\ngiven by\n\n    S_\u03bc\u0303\u03bd\u0303= \u039e^2(\u03b4_\u03bc\u0303^\u03bc \n      - 2x^\u03bcx\u0303_\u03bc\u0303)\n      (\u03b4_\u03bd\u0303^\u03bd -2x^\u03bdx\u0303_\u03bd\u0303)S_\u03bc\u03bd.\n\nTo complete the discussion, one can construct an unphysical spherical\npolar coordinate system. Upon introducing\n\u03c1^2=\u03b4_ijx^ix^j, a calculation shows that the unphysical\n (conformal) metric\u00a0\u03b7 and conformal factor\u00a0\u039e read\n\n    \u03b7=-\ud835\udc1dt\u2297\ud835\udc1dt +\ud835\udc1d\u03c1\u2297\ud835\udc1d\u03c1+\u03c1^2 \u03c3,     \u039e=\u03c1^2 -t^2,\n\nwith\u00a0t\u2208(-\u221e,\u221e) and\u00a0\u03c1\u2208\u00a0[0,\u221e).  Notice that\nspatial infinity i^0 of the physical Minkowski spacetime\n(\u211d^4, ) is mapped to the origin (t=0,\u03c1=0)\nin (\u211d^4,\u03b7). Also, future and past null infinity\n\u2110^\u00b1 of the physical Minkowski spacetime are mapped to the\nlightcone passing through the origin. In other words, introducing the\nunphysical retarded and advanced times u:=t-\u03c1 and v:=t+\u03c1,\nfuture/past null infinity \u2110^\u00b1 is located at v=0 and\nu=0 respectively.  To round up the discussion between the relation the\nphysical and unphysical coordinates, here we record that\n\n    t=t\u0303/\u03c1\u0303^2-t\u0303^2,     \u03c1 =\n       \u03c1\u0303/\u03c1\u0303^2-t\u0303^2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Linearised equations around the Minkowski-inversion \n            background\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The background solution\n\n\nWe now fix the background solution \u03d5 to be the\nMinkowski inversion background discussed in the previous subsection,\n<ref>.

The propagation of the (first order) CEFEs by the wave-CEFEs\n  has been proven at the non-linear level in <cit.> and the\n  result at the linear level follows from linearisation of the\n  subsidiary system obtained in <cit.>.  Also, a procedure to\n  obtain initial data for the conformal wave CEFEs at the non-linear\n  level has been outlined in <cit.>: one starts by solving the\n  conformal Einstein constraint equations on \u03a3 which constitute\n  the spatial parts of the zero-quantities\n  (<ref>). Then, the time derivatives of the\n  evolved fields on \u03a3 can be read from the zero-quantities using\n  the solution to the conformal Einstein constraints.  An analogous\n  procedure can be performed for the linear case to obtain initial data\n  for the wave equations (<ref>). Observe that from\n  equations (<ref>) and (<ref>)\n  one only needs to consider their trace-free parts as the traces give\n  the wave equations (<ref>) and (<ref>),\n  respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Scri-fixing gauge\n\n\nA difficulty with the standard CEFEs concerns the fact that in general,\nthe conformal boundary is not fixed with respect to the coordinates.\nAlthough there exist a generalisation of the CEFEs, the extended\nCEFEs (see for instance <cit.>) that allows to have an explicit\nexpression the conformal factor, this approach is based on gauge adapted\nto a congruence of conformal geodesics, called the conformal Gaussian\ngauge. The latter requires the use of more general type of connections\nknown as Weyl connections and it is in general difficult to write\nexplicitly the line element of physically relevant solutions in the\ncoordinates adapted to the conformal Gaussian gauge.  Here, we give an\nalternative simpler approach based on exploiting the gauge source\nfunctions in the wave formulation of the standard CEFEs. In the linear\ncase, the key is to find a gauge choice such that equation (<ref>)\nis homogeneous. This amounts to choosing the Lorenz gauge source\nfunctions such that F^\u03bc satisfies\n\n    F^\u03bc_\u03bc = - 4 \u03b4 s + s\u03b4\n    g_\u03bc^\u03bc + 1/6\u03b4 F.\n\nThus, if trivial initial data is given to equation (<ref>) on the\ninitial hypersurface then the trivial solution \u03b4\u039e=0 is\nobtained in the development. Hence, \u039e= and that the location\nof the conformal boundary of the perturbed linearised solution coincides\nwith that of the background spacetime. Observe that to solve equation\n(<ref>) one needs _\u03bc\u2260 0 and\nalthough this condition does not hold at i^0, this is not a problem\nfor foliations that end at a cut \ud835\udc9e of \u2110 (e.g.\nthe hyperboloidal and null foliations) \u2014see Figure <ref>.\n\nIn the non-linear case one can proceed in a similar way.  The non-linear\nversion of the wave equation for the conformal factor reads:\n  \n    \u039e = - 16\u039e F -\n        \u210b^\u03bc\u2207_\u03bc\u039e + 4 s\n\nwhere := g^\u03bc\u03bd\u2202_\u03bc\u2202_\u03bd and x^\u03bc is\na fiduciary coordinate system \u2014see Appendix <ref>. One can\nfollow the same approach as in the linear case and think of \u039e as a\ngiven function of the coordinates and solve for the gauge source\nfunctions. Although this approach is of limited use for the Cauchy\nproblem as \u2207_\u03bc\u039e vanishes at i^0, this is not an issue for\nfoliations which end at a cut \ud835\udc9e of \u2110 for which\n\u2207_\u03bc\u039e\u2260 0.  As a concrete example and to make contact with\nthe hyperboloidal framework of <cit.> consider an unphysical coordinate system x^\u03bc=(\u03c4, r,\n\u03d1^A) with A=1,2, related to physical coordinates\nx\u0303^\u03bc\u0303 =(t\u0303, r\u0303, \u03d1^A) according\nto the standard hyperboloidal prescription t\u0303= \u03c4 +\nH(r\u0303) and r\u0303= r/\u03a9 (r) where H and\n\u03a9 are known as the height and compression functions. If one sets\n\u039e= \u03a9(r) then equation (<ref>) fixes one of the\ncomponents of the coordinate gauge source functions\n  \u210b^\u03bc as:\n  \n    \u210b^r = - \u03a9\u201d/\u03a9'g^rr +\n        4s/\u03a9' - \u03a9/6\u03a9' F.\n\nwhere \u03a9' := d\u03a9/dr. If the slice is hyperboloidal\nthen \u03a9' \u2260 0 at \u2110.\n\n \n   In <cit.> a similar gauge-fixing is\n  developed, however in the previous work the evolution equations are\n  formally singular while in the CEFE approach of this paper the\n  equations are formally regular.  Also, the general strategy put\n  forward here is not bound to the hyperboloidal and asymptotically flat\n  set-up as a similar scri-fixing procedure could be adapted to study\n  spacetimes with de-Sitter (and anti-de-Sitter) asymptotics using CEFEs\n  similar to the case of <cit.> and <cit.> where the\n  gauge was fixed using, instead, a congruence of conformal geodesics.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Recall that g_ab=\u039e^2g\u0303_ab, hence for the linear\n  perturbations one has:\n  \n    \u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd=\u039e^2\u03b4g\u0303_\u03bc\u03bd +\n        2\u039eg\u0303_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b4\u039e .\n\n  Using the above described gauge to set \u03b4\u039e=0, then equation\n  (<ref>) reduces to \u03b4\n  g_\u03bc\u03bd=\u039e^2 \u03b4g\u0303_\u03bc\u03bd.  However, it\n  should be stressed that \u03b4g\u0303_\u03bc\u03bd\u2260\u03b4g\u0303_\u03bc\u0303\u03bd\u0303.

Note that we have split the metric\nperturbation into its trace \u03b4 g_\u03bc^\u03bc and its trace-free part\n\u03b4 g_{\u03bc\u03bd}. In this manner, one can identify the variables\nthat satisfy homogeneous equations.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Solutions to the homogeneous equations\n\n\nThe solutions of homogeneous wave equations in flat spacetime are widely\nknown and understood, but since the initial data are subject to the\ninitial constraints (<ref>), it is perhaps appropriate to\nbriefly discuss how one might write the solutions explicitly in terms of\nthe initial data. For a field \u03b4_H satisfying a homogeneous\nwave equation \u25a1\u03b4_H=0, the solution may be\nwritten in the form <cit.>:\n\n    \u03b4_H(x) \n         = - \u222b_\u03a3 d \u03a3^'_\u03bb[ \u03b4_H(x^') \n            \u2202^\u03bb D(x,x^')\n            - D(x,x^') \n            \u2202^\u03bb\u03b4_H(x^')\n          ] ,\n\nwhere d \u03a3^'_\u03bb = (1/3!)\u03f5_\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 dx^'\u03b1\u2227 dx^'\u03b2\u2227\ndx^'\u03b3 is the surface element on \u03a3, the underline\ndenotes evaluation of a quantity on \u03a3, and the quantity\nD(x,x^'):=G^+(x,x^')-G^-(x,x^') is the difference\nbetween the retarded (-) and advanced (+) Green's functions, defined\nas \n\n    G^\u00b1(x,x^')\n      \n         := - \u03b4(x^0-x^' 0\u00b1|x\u20d7-x\u20d7^'|)/4\u03c0 |x\u20d7-x\u20d7^'|\n      ,\n\nand satisfying the inhomogeneous equation \u25a1\nG^\u00b1(x,x^') = -\u03b4^4(x-x^'). That (<ref>)\nis a solution of (<ref>-<ref>) can be seen\nby noting that D(x,x^'), being the difference of two Green's\nfunctions, is a solution of the homogeneous wave equation. It is\nstraightforward to show that D(x,x^')=0 if x^0=x^0',\nand one can also show <cit.> that D(x,x^')\nsatisfies the properties:\n\n\n    -.\n      \u222b_\u03a3 d \u03a3^'_\u03c4[ \n              _H(x^') \n              \u2202^\u03c4 D(x,x^') \n        ]\n      |_x \u2208\u03a3   = _H(x \u2208\u03a3) ,\n      \n    .\n                \u2202^2 D(x,x^')/\u2202\u0394 t^2|_\u0394 t=0   = 0\n      \n      .\n  \n \nwhere \u0394 t:=x^0-x^' 0. Equation (<ref>)\nfollows from the fact that for a given |x\u20d7-x\u20d7^'|,\nD(x,x^') is by construction an odd function in \u0394 t. Given\n(<ref>), one can verify that the coefficients in\n(<ref>) do in fact coincide with the initial data (though\nnote that (<ref>) only depends on the time derivatives of\nthe fields). Of course, as indicated earlier, the initial data for the\nfields must satisfy the vacuum version of (<ref>).\n\nGiven the simplicity of the vacuum wave equations and their resemblance\nto wave equations in ordinary Minkowski space it is tempting to write\nthe solutions in terms of plane waves. While one can certainly obtain\nsolutions to the wave equations in this manner, a difficulty arises from\nthe fact that even in the vacuum case, the constraints\n(<ref>) are nontrivial, since the background expression\nfor \u039e in the inversion coordinates is explicitly\ncoordinate dependent. As a result, solutions satisfying the constraints\ndo not have a clean mode separation in a Cartesian Fourier expansion\n(though perhaps an alternative mode decomposition may be appropriate).\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Solutions to the inhomogeneous equations and including \nmatter\n\n\nFor completeness, we discuss the solutions of equations\n(<ref>) and (<ref>). One may begin by\nassuming that one has in hand initial data satisfying the constraints\n(<ref>). We note that the structure of the vacuum\nequations has a hierarchy: one can first solve for \u03b4 s, \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd, \u03b4 d_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2, and \u03b4\ng^\u03bc_\u03bc, then use the result to solve for \u03b4 g_{\u03bc\u03bd} and \u03b4\u039e. Schematically, one may then write the\ninhomogeneous wave equations for the latter two in the following form\n(where S is a source that depends on the background field\nexpressions and \u03b4 s, \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd, and \u03b4\ng^\u03bc_\u03bc):\n\n    \u25a1\u03b4_I(x) =  S(x),\n\nwhich yields a particular solution (with x^0=t, \nx^' 0=t^'):\n\n    \u03b4_I_0(x) \n             = \u03b4_H_0(x) \n            - \u222b_t_0^t dt^'\u222b d^3x\u20d7^'[ \n              G^-(x,x^')  S(x^')\n            ] ,\n\nwhere \u03b4_H_0(x) is a solution to the homogeneous equation\nwith initial conditions chosen so that the particular solution \u03b4_I_0(x) has trivial initial conditions \u03b4_I_0(x)=0 and \u2202_t \u03b4_I_0(x)=0 on\n\u03a3; this can in principle be done by evaluating the integral term\nand its derivative on \u03a3 to obtain -\u03b4_H_0(x^') and -\u2202_t \u03b4_H_0(x^'). Finally, to obtain the solution corresponding to\nthe prescribed initial data, one can then add to \u03b4_I_0(x) a homogeneous solution of the form in equation\n(<ref>). Since we are interested in the initial value\nproblem, we have chosen the retarded Green's function\nG^-(x,x^') in (<ref>). This is (as the reader\nmight be aware) because G^-(x,x^') is only nontrivial for x^0\n> x^' 0, so that for a given point x, the field contributions\nfrom the integral in (<ref>) depend on the values of the\nsource in the past of x (specifically over the past light cone of\nx).\n\nWe note that the procedure described for the inhomogeneous equation can\nbe straightforwardly extended to the full set of non-vacuum equations\n(<ref>), subject to the constraints (<ref>) on\nthe initial data. As in the vacuum case, one has a hierarchy in which\none can first specify the matter sources, then solve for the variables\n\u03b4 s, \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd, \u03b4 d_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2,\nand \u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd, and finally solve for the conformal\nperturbation \u03b4\u039e using the previously obtained results. Of\ncourse, the preceding discussion glosses over the problem of solving the\nmatter equations, however such analysis is matter-model dependent. Hence\nin the present analysis they are simply regarded as given sources in the\nequations.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The far-field approximation and quadrupole-like formulae\n\n\n\n\nAs emphasised before, an appealing property of the wave formulation of\nthe CEFEs is that the metric sector of the equations looks as the\nstandard non-conformal Einstein field equations with some\nartificial-geometric matter term. This suggests that some of the\nstandard techniques and approximation methods can be applied to the\nlinearised wave CEFEs such as solving them in the far-field regime and\nobtaining quadrupole-like formulae.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The far-field approximation\n\n\nTo derive the far-field approximation, we focus our attention not to the\nhomogeneous part of the solution to equation (<ref>) but\nto the part generated by the sources. For simplicity, we omit nontrivial\nhomogeneous solutions and \u03b4_H_0(x) in the particular\nsolution (which corresponds to an appropriate choice of initial data),\nso that the solution consists only of the integral in equation\n(<ref>). Upon evaluating the time integral, one obtains:\n\n    \u03b4= -1/4\u03c0\u222b_\u03a3(t-|x\u20d7-x\u20d7^'|,x\u20d7^')/|x\u20d7-x\u20d7^'|d^3x\u20d7^'.\n\nThis is of course just the standard expression one can find in standard\ntextbooks\u2014see  <cit.>.  To obtain a far-field expression in the\nunphysical set-up we start by recalling that the origin in the inversion\n(unphysical) Minkowski spacetime corresponds to spatial infinity i^0\nfor the physical Minkowski spacetime so the far-field region in physical\nMinkowski spacetime corresponds to a neighbourhood of the origin in the\ninversion Minkowski spacetime.  Let ' and  be a points in\nthe physical Minkowski spacetime with physical Cartesian coordinates\n(0, x\u0303^' i) and (0, x\u0303^i) respectively.\nExpressed in unphysical Cartesian coordinates, these points correspond\nto (0, x^' i) and (0,x^i). Hence, the distance r between\n' and  can be expressed through the vector\n\n \n    r\u20d7:=x\u20d7-x\u20d7^'=x\u20d7\u0303\u20d7\n          -x\u20d7\u0303\u20d7^'.\n\nIn terms of the physical coordinates, imposing the far-field\napproximation means |x\u20d7\u0303\u20d7|>>|x\u20d7\u0303\u20d7^'|.\nConsequently,\n \n    r:=|r\u20d7| = |x\u20d7\u0303\u20d7-x\u20d7\u0303\u20d7^'| \n       \u2243 |x\u20d7\u0303\u20d7|\n       =1/|x\u20d7|= 1/\u03c1.\n\nTherefore, in the far-field approximation one can write\n  \n    \u03b4\u2243 -\u03c1/4\u03c0\u222b_\u211d^3 \n        (t-r,x\u20d7^')d^3x\u20d7^'.\n\n\nIn particular, for the case where \u03b4 is either \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd, \u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd or \u03b4 d_\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\none can derive quadrupole-like formulae. To do so, it is necessary to\ncompute the divergence of the source terms appearing in equations\n(<ref>), (<ref>) and (<ref>).\nLet's define\n\n    \ud835\udcae_\u03bc\u03bd    :=-4 \u03b4\u03a6 _\u03bc\u03bd\n        - g_\u03bc\u03bd _\u03b1F^\u03b1\n        +  _\u03bcF_\u03bd +  _\u03bdF_\u03bc +\n        12\u03b4 F _\u03bc\u03bd\n    \n       S_\u03bc\u03bd   :=-2 \u03b4 T_(\u03bc^\u03b1_\u03bd)_\u03b1 \n      - _\u03b1\u03b4 T_\u03bc^\u03b1_\u03bd\n      + 1/6_{\u03bc_\u03bd}\u03b4 F, \n    \n       S_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2   :=\n      2 _[\u03bc\u03b4 T _|\u03b1\u03b2|\u03bd] \n      + 2 _[\u03b1\u03b4 T_|\u03bc\u03bd|\u03b2] \n      + 2 _\u03b2[\u03bd_|\u03c3\u03b4 T_\u03b1|^\u03c3_\u03bc] \n      + 2 _\u03b1[\u03bc_|\u03c3\u03b4 T_\u03b2|^\u03c3_\u03bd].\n\nRecall that the fields encoded in \u03d5 satisfy the\nCEFEs, hence the background conformal factor satisfies\nZ_ab=0 as defined in equation\n(<ref>), which for the flat background\ncase reduces to _\u03bc _\u03bd =  s_\u03bc\u03bd. A direct calculation using the latter expression  and\nthe matter relations (<ref>) shows that\n\n    ^\u03bd\ud835\udcae_\u03bc\u03bd=\u25a1F_\u03bc,     ^\u03bd  S_\u03bc\u03bd= \n      18\u25a1_\u03bd\u03b4 F,     ^\u03bb  S_\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b2 =\n      \u25a1\u03b4 T_\u03c3\u03b2\u03b1.\n\nThe first two equations simply encode equations\n(<ref>) and (<ref>)  in a\ndivergence-like format. The third equation in (<ref>) shows\nthat equation (<ref>) propagates.\n\n\n\n  \n  For the scalar variables \u03b4 s and \u03b4\u039e, the leading\n  order source terms can be evaluated directly. In the case of rank-2\n  tensors, a reason for reducing the sources to quadrupole form is\n  to make the field dependent on a single (the time-time) component of \n  the source tensor.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 A quadrupole-like formula for \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd and \n\u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\n\nHere, we derive quadrupole-like formulae for \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd and\n\u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd, which we discuss in tandem. Since the source term\n\ud835\udcae_\u03bc\u03bd contains \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd [cf. equation\n(<ref>)] first one solves for \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd\nand then for \u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd.  Let \u03b4 Q_\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd or \u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd and \u2131_\u03bc =\n18_\u03bc\u03b4 F  or  F_\u03bc, and\n\u03c3_\u03bc\u03bd = S_\u03bc\u03bd or \ud835\udcae_\u03bc\u03bd,\nrespectively.  Exploiting that equations (<ref>)\nand (<ref>) can be collectively written as\n^\u03bd\u03b4 Q_\u03bc\u03bd= \u2131_\u03bc one has that\n\n    _0 \u03b4 Q_00=^i\u03b4 Q_i0 -\u2131_0,\n          _0 \u03b4 Q_0i=^j\u03b4 Q_ij\n      -\u2131_i,\n\nThus, once \u03b4 Q_ij is determined, \u03b4 Q_0i can be\nobtained by formally integrating the second equation in\n(<ref>). In turn, \u03b4 Q_00 is obtained by\nintegrating the first equation in (<ref>).  For the\nparticular case of \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd one could instead use that\n\u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc^\u03bc=0 to solve algebraically for \u03b4\u03a6_00.\nThus, one can reduce the discussion to that of obtaining a\nquadrupole-like formula for \u03b4 Q_ij. Recall that the far-field\napproximation reads\n\n    \u03b4 Q_ij\u2243 -\u03c1/4\u03c0\u222b_\u03a3\u03c3_ij(t-r,x\u20d7^')d^3x\u20d7^'.\n\nIf one were to restrict the calculations to gauge source functions\nsatisfying \u25a1F^\u03bc = \u25a1_\u03bc\u03b4 F= 0 (in particular, F^\u03bc= \u03b4 F=0) then the integrand\nwould satisfy ^\u03bd\u03c3_\u03bc\u03bd=0 leading to an\nexpression which is formally identical to the quadrupole formula in the\nnon-conformal set-up for the physical metric perturbation \u2014see for\ninstance <cit.>.  However, it is instructive to keep the\ngauge source function terms since it will serve as model for the\nderivation of the quadrupole-like formula for the rescaled Weyl tensor\nwhere the divergence of the source term S_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 cannot\nbe set to zero by gauge considerations \u2014see the last equation in\n (<ref>). Here, we only assume that the gauge source\nfunctions are specified. The first two equations (<ref>) in the\ncurrent notation read ^\u03bd\u03c3_\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u25a1\u2131_\u03bc, which in components read\n\n    _0\u03c3^00 + _i\u03c3^i0\n      =\u25a1\u2131^0,     _0\u03c3^0i\n      + _j\u03c3^ij = \u25a1\u2131^i.\n\nIntegrating _i(\u03c3^ikx^' j) over a region\n\u03a9\u2282\u03a3 and using Gauss' law gives the following\nidentity\n\n    \u222b_\u2202\u03a9\u03c3^ik x^' j ds_i =\u222b_\u03a9\u03c3^jkd^3x\u20d7^' + \u222b_\u03a9 x^' j_i\n      \u03c3^ikd^3x\u20d7^',\n\nwhere we have used _i x^' j = \u03b4_i^j and\nds_i is the surface element of \u2202\u03a9.\n\n\n   It will be assumed that the matter fields encoded in\n  S_\u03bc\u03bd and S_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2, as defined in equation\n  (<ref>), have compact support in \u03a9\u2282\u211d^3.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nRecall that  \u25a1\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd=S_\u03bc\u03bd, then\nunder assumption <ref> it follows that\n\u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd has compact support in \u03a9.\nFurthermore, choosing\nthe gauge source function F^\u03bc appropriately,\none can then assume that that \ud835\udcae_\u03bc\u03bd [as given in equation\n(<ref>)] has compact support in \u03a9.\n\n\n\n\nUsing assumption <ref> and Remark\n<ref>, equations (<ref>) and\n(<ref>) give\n\n    \u222b_\u03a9\u03c3^jkd^3x\u20d7^'=-\u222b_\u03a9x^'(j\u25a1\u2131^k)d^3x\u20d7^' +\n      d/dt^'\u222b_\u03a9x^'(j\u03c3^k)0d^3x\u20d7^'.\n\nSimilarly, integrating _k(\u03c3^0kx^' ix^'\n  j) over a region \u03a9 and proceeding as before, making use of\nGauss' law one obtains\n\n    \u222b_\u2202\u03a9\u03c3^0kx^' ix^' j ds_k\n      =\u222b_\u03a9 x^' ix^' j_k\n      \u03c3^0kd^3x\u20d7^' + 2 \u222b_\u03a9 x^' (i\u03c3^j)0d^3x\u20d7^'.\n\nThen using Remark <ref> and equations\n(<ref>) and (<ref>) renders\n\n    \u222b_\u03a9 x^'(i\u03c3^j)0d^3x\u20d7^'  =\n      -1/2\u222b_\u03a9 x^' ix^' j\u25a1\u2131^0 d^3x\u20d7^'\n      + 1/2d/dt^'\u222b_\u03a9 x^' ix^' j\u03c3^00d^3x\u20d7^'\n\nCombining equations (<ref>)\nand (<ref>) one gets\n\n    \u222b_\u03a9\u03c3^jkd^3x\u20d7^' =\n         1/2d^2/dt^'^2\u222b_\u03a9 x^' i x^' j\u03c3^00d^3x\u20d7^'-1/2d/dt^'\u222b_\u03a9 x^' ix^' j\u25a1\u2131^0 d^3x\u20d7^'\n       -\u222b_\u03a9x^'(j\u25a1\u2131^k)d^3x\u20d7^'\n\ntherefore, using the far-field approximation (<ref>)\ngives\n\n    \u03b4 Q_ij\u2243 -\u03c1/8\u03c0d^2\u2110_ij(t')/dt'^2|_t'=t-r +\u03c1/8\u03c0d\ud835\udca5_ij(t')/dt'|_t'=t-r -\u03c1/4\u03c0\ud835\udca6_ij(t')|_t'=t-r\n\nwhere\n\n    \u2110^ij:= \u222b_\u03a9\u03c3^00x^' ix^'\n        jd^3x\u20d7^',     \ud835\udca5^ij := \u222b_\u03a9\n      x^' ix^' j\u25a1\u2131^0d^3x\u20d7^',     \ud835\udca6^ij := \u222b_\u03a9\u25a1\u2131^(ix^' j) d^3x\u20d7^'.\n\n\nAs discussed earlier, the gauge source functions could be set to zero, \nbut in certain applications, it can be useful to consider general gauge \nsource functions.

The concern is that in order to\n  implement the far-field approximation, one implicitly assumes a\n  slow-motion approximation, which is inconsistent with radiation\n  propagating at the speed of light. However, geons\n  <cit.> and\n  photon stars\n  <cit.>\n  provide examples of stationary compact sources formed from\n  self-gravitating radiation, which may at the very least provide useful\n  toy models (the extension of our results to the case of nonvanishing\n  trace will be discussed elsewhere). Nevertheless, the primary reason\n  for the preceding analysis is to provide a template for deriving the\n  quadrupole formula for the rescaled Weyl tensor, which can be\n  straightforwardly generalised to the case with trace.

Consider any tensor W_abcd with the symmetries of the\nWeyl tensor and let n^a be a normalised timelike vector such that\nn_an^a=-1. Define the associated projector as\nh_a^b:=g_a^b + n_an^b. Then, the electric part E_ab\nand magnetic part B_ab of W_abcd are given by\n\n    E_ab:=W_efgdn^fn^dh_a^eh_b^d,     \n    B_ab:=W^*_efgdn^fn^dh_a^eh_b^d,\n\nwhere B_ab=-12\u03f5_cd^efW_abef with\n\u03f5_abcd is the (4-dimensional) volume-form of g_ab.  In\npractice (particularly when working in an adapted frame), instead of\nworking directly with B_ab it is simpler to use\n\n    B_abc:=W_efghn^fh_a^eh_b^gh_c^h,\n\nwhich is related to B_ab via B_ab= -\n1/2B_acd\u03f5_b^cd where\n\u03f5_abc:=\u03f5_fabcn^f is the (3-dimensional) volume-form\nof h_ab \u2014see <cit.> for further discussion on the\nelectric-magnetic decomposition. In the present case, since the\nbackground is flat, one can simply take the normal vector to be n^\u03bd=\n\u03b4_0^\u03bd so that the electric-magnetic split of\nd_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 simply correspond to\n\n    \u03b4 d_ij:= \u03b4 d_i0j0,     \u03b4 d_ijk:=\u03b4\n    d_i0jk.\n\nThe wave equation for \u03b4 d_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2, which compactly\nwritten  reads \u25a1\u03b4 d_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2=\nS_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2, can then be split into the wave equations for\nd_ij and d_ijk:\n\n    \u25a1\u03b4 d_ij= S_ij,     \u25a1\u03b4 d_ijk= S_ijk,\n\nwhere S_ij:=  S_i0j0 and S_ijk:= S_i0jk. Using the\nfar-field approximation expression (<ref>) and equation\n(<ref>) then gives\n\n    \u03b4 d_i\u03bc j \u03bd\u2243 -\u03c1/8\u03c0d^2I_ij\u03bc\u03bd(t')/dt'^2|_t'=t-r +\u03c1/8\u03c0dJ_ij\u03bc\u03bd(t')/dt'|_t'=t-r +\u03c1/4\u03c0\n     K_ij\u03bc\u03bd(t')|_t'=t-r,\n\nwhere\n\n    I^ij \u03bc\u03bd:=\u222b_\u03a9 y^iy^j \u03b4 S^0\u03bd 0 \u03bcd^3y\u20d7,\n           J^ij \u03bc\u03bd:=\u222b_\u03a9 y^iy^j \u25a1\u03b4\n      T^0 \u03bc\u03bdd^3y\u20d7,      K^ij \u03bc\u03bd:= \u222b_\u03a9 y^(i\u25a1\u03b4 T^j)\u03bd\u03bc d^3y\u20d7.\n\nIn particular, setting \u03bc=0 and \u03bd=0 one gets the quadrupole-like\nexpression for \u03b4 d_ij and similarly taking \u03bc=0 and \u03bd =\nk for \u03b4 d_ijk.  Proceeding as described before and exploiting\nthe symmetries of S^\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (those of the Weyl tensor) and\nthose of \u03b4 T^\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd [cf. equation\n(<ref>)] renders\n\n    \u03b4 d_ij\u2243\u03c1/4\u03c0 K_ij00(t')|_t'=t-r ,\n          \u03b4 d_ijk\u2243\u03c1/4\u03c0 K_ijk0(t')|_t'=t-r,\n\nRecall that the rescaled Cotton tensor T_\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd can be\nexpressed in terms of the derivatives of the unphysical energy momentum\ntensor. Therefore equation (<ref>) allows one to\nexpress the perturbation to the rescaled Weyl tensor in the far-field\napproximation in terms  derivatives of the perturbation to the\nunphysical energy momentum tensor \u03b4 T_\u03bc\u03bd and background\nquantities via equation (<ref>).\n\n\n \n   Although the focus of this article has been in the conformal\n  spacetime set-up \u2014and hence restricted to trace-free matter models\u2014\n  an analogous calculation can be performed directly in the physical\n  spacetime, lifting then the trace-free  matter restriction,\n  obtaining a quadrupole-like formula for perturbations of the Weyl\n  tensor.  Observe that, for the derivation of the wave equation\n  satisfied by the rescaled Weyl tensor, the specific form of the\n  rescaled Cotton tensor (in terms of the unphysical energy-momentum\n  tensor) is never used. It follows that for the physical set-up, one \n  gets a\n  formally identical equation.  The wave equation for the Weyl tensor\n  has been derived for instance in <cit.> and <cit.>.\n  Therefore, the analysis of section <ref> would still\n  hold replacing the rescaled Weyl tensor d_abcd with the Weyl\n  tensor C_abcd and the rescaled Cotton tensor T_abc by its\n  physical counterpart T\u0303_abc which written in terms of the\n  physical energy-momentum reads:\n  \n    T\u0303_abc:= \u2207\u0303_[aT\u0303_b]c +\n        1/3g\u0303_c[b\u2207\u0303_a](\u03bb- T\u0303).\n\n\n\n\n \n   We note that the expression for S_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is\n  independent of the choices for the gauge source function. For this\n  reason, one can choose the scri-fixing gauge independently of the\n  assumption that S_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 has compact support in\n  \u03a9; the quadrupole-like formula we obtain for the rescaled Weyl\n  tensor is therefore compatible with any gauge choice, in particular\n  the scri-fixing gauge introduced earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\n\n\n\nIn this article, we have presented the linearisation of the wave-like\nhyperbolic reduction of the CEFEs in a GHG gauge for a general\nbackground. As a first step toward studying the linear perturbations of\nspacetimes using the conformal CEFE approach, the equations have been\nparticularised to the case where the background is the inversion\n(unphysical) Minkowski spacetime. Conceptually, when studying\nperturbations of the physical Minkowski spacetime, one can in principle\nuse any conformally flat metric so that\nd_\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2=0. However having a non-vanishing\n\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd makes the equations quite cumbersome. Hence,\nas a first analysis, we have opted to use as a background the inversion\nMinkowski spacetime for which \u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd=R=0.\nFor this background, we discuss the propagation of the gauge (the\ngeneralised Lorenz gauge and the linear version of the conformal\nconstraints). The fact that the chosen background is flat permits the\nuse of techniques similar to those of the classical methods in physical\nspacetime to study gravitational waves. In this manner, we have obtained\nthe conformal CEFE counterpart of the classical linearisation of the\n(physical) Einstein field equations.\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, one may wish to consider linearising around non-flat\nconformal representations of the Minkowski spacetime. A particularly\ninteresting choice is the i^0-cylinder representation of Minkowski\nspacetime, as this is particularly useful for studying the gravitational\nfield close to the critical sets \u2110^\u00b1\u2014the region where\nnull-infinity \u2110 and spatial infinity i^0 meet.  Although\nthis analysis has been done via the spin-2 equation\n\u2207_A'^A\u03d5_ABCD=0 in <cit.> (see also\n<cit.> for a discussion of the solutions of\nwave equations in this background) where it has been shown that the\n(linearisation of rescaled Weyl spinor) spin-2 field develops\nlogarithmic terms, it would be of interest to see how these logarithmic\nterms manifest in the metric, which is the variable employed in most\nperturbation schemes in physics (such as the post-Minkowskian\nexpansions). Another interesting class of backgrounds are Petrov type D\nspacetimes such as Kerr, so that a conformal Teukolsky-like equation may\nbe obtained; however, a different linearisation procedure (such as that\nof Chandrasekhar<cit.>), may be more appropriate in that case.\nThese avenues will be pursued in future work.  More generally, the\npresent work represents a first step into studying linear perturbations\nof spacetimes of physical interest within the CEFE\nframework.\n\n\n\n\nA particularly useful result of this paper is the development of a\nscri-fixing strategy using gauge source functions for CEFEs.  Our\nstrategy provides an alternative to more abstract gauges based on\nconformal curves and conformal geodesics <cit.>, one that is\nparticularly well-suited for numerical implementation. Though the\nstrategy is initially developed for the linearised equations (which are\nexpected to be good approximation in the weak field region of\nasymptotically flat spacetimes of physical interest), the generalisation\nto the nonlinear case, as discussed in the main text, is\nstraightforward. A minor limitation of this scri-fixing strategy in the\nasymptotically flat setting is that the initial data must be prescribed\non slices that intersect future null infinity (as opposed to spatial\ninfinity), nonetheless our scri-fixing strategy fits well within the\nhyperboloidal approach to Numerical Relativity.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we have constructed quadrupole-like formulae for the CEFEs\nlinearised around a flat background. While the quadrupole-like formulae\nfor \u03b4 g_\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b4\u03a6_\u03bc\u03bd require gauge\nsource functions with compact support and a trace-free energy-momentum\ntensor, the quadrupole-like formula we obtain for the Weyl tensor is\nindependent of gauge choice and is formally identical to the case where\nthe energy-momentum tensor has nonvanishing trace. Since the Weyl tensor\nyields an unambigious notion of gravitational radiation at future null\ninfinity, our result provides a familiar prescription for computing\ngravitational waveforms at null infinity generated by weakly gravitating\nsources in the linear approximation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Acknowledgements\n\n\n\n\nWe have profited from conversations with Juan Valiente Kroon and David\nHilditch and Alex Va\u00f1\u00f3 Vi\u00f1uales.

In particular, we wish to\nrecast (<ref>) explicitly as a system of second order\nhyperbolic equations.  This non-linear system of wave equations was\noriginally derived in <cit.> using slightly different set of\nvariables and a different reduced wave operator.\n\n\n\nFirst observe that in general, the geometric wave operator acting on a\ntensor will give rise to derivatives of the Christoffel symbols. Since\nthe metric is a variable of the system, this is problematic for\nhyperbolicity.

However, for the case with matter\n  T_ab=T_ab(\u03c4, \u2207\u03c4), one could at first instance\n  question their hyperbolicity due to the presence of first derivatives\n  of the rescaled Cotton tensor T_abc which encode second\n  derivatives of the energy-momentum tensor T_ab \u2014hence the\n  equations contain two (or more) derivatives of the matter fields\n  \u03c4. Nonetheless, one can still ensure hyperbolicity\n  constructing wave equations for \u03c4 and \u2207\u03c4 so that\n  T_abc is expressed in terms of evolved fields only. For instance,\n  in the case of the conformally invariant scalar field\n  T_ab=T_ab(\u03d5, \u2207\u03d5)  one needs to construct wave\n  equations for \u03d5 and a reduction variable \u03c6=\u2207\u03d5\n  \u2014see <cit.>.  Since this is a case-dependent analysis and\n  this has been done in <cit.> for a number of matter models,\n  further discussion is omitted. \n\n\n\nIn <cit.> the reduced wave operator is defined so that the\nlower order contributions (along with terms involving the gauge source\nfunctions) are absorbed into the definition of the operator\n\u25aa in such a way that the reduced equations look formally\nidentical to the geometric ones. Here the standard reduced wave operator\n:=g^\u03b1\u03b2\u2202_\u03b1\u2202_\u03b2 used in most\ndiscussions of generalised harmonic gauge in Numerical Relativity was\nemployed instead. The initial data for the reduced wave equations\n(<ref>) have to satisfy\n\n    Z_\u03bc\u03bd|_\u03a3=0,    Z_\u03bc|_\u03a3=0,   \u03b4_\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3|_\u03a3=0,   \u03bb_\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3|_\u03a3=0,    Z|_\u03a3=0.\n\nwhere \u03a3\u2282\u2133 is a spacelike hypersurface on which\nthe initial data is prescribed. It should also be noticed that the\nGHG-constraint C^\u03bc and the conformal constraint C are not\nindependent, in fact a calculation shows C=\u2207_\u03bc C^\u03bc.\nPropagation of the gauge and a full discussion of the propagation of the\nconstraints [i.e. propagation of the zero-quantities\n(<ref>)] has carefully been done in\n<cit.> and will not be reproduced here.  The aim of revisiting\nthe derivation of the reduced wave equations (<ref>) is\nsimply to provide context and the non-linear analogue of the\nlinearised equations derived in Section <ref>.\n\n\n\nunsrt\n\n10\n\nHilNur16\nC\u00a0Denson Hill and Pawel Nurowski.\nHow the green light was given for gravitational wave search, 2016.\n\nBieGarYun17\nLydia Bieri, David Garfinkle, and Nicolas Yunes.\nGravitational waves and their mathematics.\n2017.\n\nZen08\nAnil Zenginoglu.\nHyperboloidal evolution with the Einstein equations.\nClass.
