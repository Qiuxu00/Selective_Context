We refer to these frames as Milnor frames. We define extensions of Milnor frames into higher dimensions. We determine that the higher dimensional analogue of Milnor's result can only hold on the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra directly summed with an abelian Lie algebra. \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\tGiven a Lie Group G and a metric g on G, we say that g is left-invariant if, for any p \u2208 G, the diffeomorphism \n\t\t \n    L_p: G \u2192 G,    q \u21a6 pq\n\n\t\t  is an isometry with respect to the metric g. A vector field X on G is said to be left-invariant if dL_p(X) = X for any p \u2208 G. By placing an inner product structure on the tangent plane at the identity, T_eG, we can extend this inner product to a left-invariant metric on G (See for example Chapter 1 Section 2 in <cit.>). The collection of left-invariant metrics on G are in one-to-one correspondence with inner product structures on T_eG. Thus given a left-invariant metric on a Lie Group G, we only need to look at the inner product structure of its associated Lie algebra. With this in mind, whenever a Lie Group G is equipped with a left-invariant metric g, we may call the Lie algebra (\ud835\udd24,g) associated to the Lie Group a metric Lie algebra with respect to the metric g. When it is obvious which left-invariant metric we are referring to, we say that \ud835\udd24 is a metric Lie algebra. \n\t\t  \n\t\t  When G is equipped with the Levi-Civita connection, the curvature is dependent on the structure constants induced by a Lie bracket [  ,  ] \u2208\u2227^2 \ud835\udd24^* \u2297\ud835\udd24 (See sections 5 and 6 in <cit.>). Thus if a metric Lie algebra has few non-trivial structure constants, determining curvature requires fewer computations. For example, Milnor <cit.> determined that any 3-dimensional unimodular metric Lie algebra admits an orthonormal frame with at most 3 non-zero structure constants. Moreover, these orthonormal frames diagonalize the Ricci-tensor. For higher dimensional metric Lie algebras, Hashinaga, Tamaru, and Terada <cit.> introduced a procedure that allows us to find an orthonormal frame with relatively few structure constants. Finding such a frame will reduce the amount of computation it takes to determine curvature. \n\t\t  \n\n\t\t\n\t\tLet \ud835\udd24 be a three-dimensional metric Lie algebra with metric g and an orientation. For two linearly independent vectors X,Y \u2208\ud835\udd24, denote the cross product X \u2227 Y to be the unique vector orthogonal to X and Y such that {X,Y, X \u2227 Y} is a positively oriented frame and \n\t\t \n    ||X \u2227 Y||^2 := g(X\u2227 Y, X\u2227 Y) = g(X,X)g(Y,Y) - g(X,Y)^2.\n\n\t\t If X and Y are not linearly independent then we say that X \u2227 Y = 0. By the universal property of wedge products there exists a linear operator L: \ud835\udd24\u2192\ud835\udd24 for which the diagram\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\ud835\udd24 \u00d7\ud835\udd24 [r, \"\u00d7\"] [rd,\"[ , ]\"]     \ud835\udd24 [d, \"L\"] \n     \ud835\udd24\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\tcommutes. Moreover \ud835\udd24 is unimodular if and only if L is self-adjoint\u00a0<cit.>. It is well-known that a self-adjoint linear operator admits an orthonormal frame of eigenvectors. Thus there is an orthonormal frame {X_1, X_2,X_3} and real numbers \u03bb_1, \u03bb_2,\u03bb_3 \u2208 R such that \n\t\t\n    [X_1,X_2] = \u03bb_3X_3,    [X_2,X_3] = \u03bb_1X_1,    [X_3,X_1] = \u03bb_3X_3.\n\n\t\tLet \u03c3 = (1   2   3) \u2208 S_3 where S_3 is the permutation group acting on 3 elements. We can rewrite the bracket identity so that for any i \u2208{1,2,3}, [X_i, X_\u03c3(i)] = \u03bb_\u03c3^2(i) X_\u03c3^2(i). \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLet \ud835\udd24 be a Lie algebra with a frame {X_1, X_2,X_3}. If there exists \u03bb_1,\u03bb_2,\u03bb_3 \u2208 R such that the bracket relation [X_i,X_\u03c3(i)] = \u03bb_\u03c3^2(i) X_\u03c3^2(i) holds for any 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3, then {X_1,X_2,X_3} is called a Milnor frame. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tUsing the permutation \u03c3 = (1  \u2026  n) we can extend this notion to higher dimensions. \n\t\t\n\t\t\tLet \ud835\udd24 be a Lie algebra of dimension n and \u03c3 = (1  \u2026  n) \u2208 S_n where S_n is the permutation group acting on n elements. A frame, {X_1, \u2026, X_n}, is a Milnor frame if for all i,j \u2208{1, \u2026, n}, there exist \u03bb_1, \u2026, \u03bb_n \u2208 R such that\n\t\t\t\n    [X_i,X_j] = \u03bb_\u03c3^2(i)X_\u03c3^2(i)   \u03c3(i) = j \n    \n    \t\t\t\t\t-\u03bb_\u03c3^2(j)X_\u03c3^2(j)   \u03c3(j) = i \n    \n    \t\t\t\t\t0    otherwise\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\tAn example of a Lie algebra with a Milnor frame of dimension n \u2265 4 is the Lie algebra, \ud835\udd25^3, associated to the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Group directly summed with an abelian Lie algebra, \ud835\udd1e, of dimension n \u2265 1. For a less trivial example let \ud835\udd25^4 be the 4-dimensional Lie algebra with a frame {X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4} whose bracket relations are generated by \n\t\t\n    [X_1,X_2] = X_3    [X_2,X_3] = X_4.\n \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAs we shall show in section\u00a0<ref>, \ud835\udd25^4 is a 3-step nilpotent Lie algebra and is thus not isomorphic to the direct sum of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra and an abelian Lie algebra. It turns out that any Lie algebra with a Milnor frame is completely determined by these two types of Lie algebras: \n\t\t\n\t\t\tFor any Lie algebra \ud835\udd24 of dimension n \u2265 4 with a Milnor frame, \ud835\udd24\u2245 (\u2295\ud835\udd25^3) \u2295 (\u2295\ud835\udd25^4) \u2295\ud835\udd1e where \ud835\udd25^3 is the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg Group, \ud835\udd25^4 is a Lie algebra with a Milnor frame and two non-trivial structure constants, and \ud835\udd1e is an abelian Lie Alebra. Moreover, these Lie algebras are at most 3-step nilpotent. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tA Corollary of Theorem\u00a0<ref> shows that any n-dimensional, n \u2265 4, Lie algebra with a Milnor frame admits a Milnor frame whose structure constants are either 0 or 1. By a result of Malcev <cit.>, the simply connected Lie group associated to such a Lie algebra has compact quotient. If a metric Lie algebra has a Milnor frame that is also orthonormal, then we obtain some \u201cnice\u201d geometric properties. For example, given an n-dimensional nilpotent metric Lie algebra (\ud835\udd24,g) with an orthonormal frame {X_1, \u2026, X_n}, Theorem 1.1 of <cit.> determines an algebraic constraint for when {X_1, \u2026, X_n} is Ricci diagonalizable. If a metric Lie algebra (\ud835\udd24,g) has an orthonormal Milnor frame {X_1, \u2026, X_n}, by Theorem\u00a0<ref> and Theorem 1.1 of\u00a0<cit.>, {X_1, \u2026, X_n} diagonalizes the Ricci tensor. For example consider the Lie algebra \ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd1e with \ud835\udd1e being a finite dimensional Lie algebra. Corollary 5.3 of <cit.> shows that \ud835\udd25^3 has one metric up to scaling and automorphism. Thus any Lie algebra with a Milnor frame which is isomorphic to \ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd1e, \ud835\udd1e abelian, must have an orthonormal Milnor frame. This raises the question: \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGiven a Lie algebra \ud835\udd24 that admits Milnor frame and a metric g on \ud835\udd24, is it possible to always find an orthonormal Milnor frame? \n\t\t\n\t\tSurprisingly, we find that this is not necessarily true. \n\t\t\n\t\t\tFor any non-abelian Lie algebra \ud835\udd24 as in Theorem\u00a0<ref> which is not isomorphic to \ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd1e where \ud835\udd1e is an abelian Lie algebra, there exists a metric g on \ud835\udd24 such that (\ud835\udd24, g) does not admit an orthonormal Milnor frame. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tThe paper will be divided into two sections. In Section\u00a0<ref>, we discuss how the algebraic structure of Milnor frames can be interpreted as directed graphs. In Section\u00a0<ref>, we discuss the geometric properties of metric Lie algebras with Milnor frames. We shall show that a metric Lie algebra with an orthonormal Milnor frame has a diagonalizable Ricci tensor. Additionally we discuss which metrics on a metric Lie algebra with a Milnor frame are Ricci nilsolitons. Finally, we consider metric Lie algebras with a Milnor frame and determine necessary conditions for the Lie algebra to admit an orthonormal Milnor frame. We conclude with a proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref>. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n \n\t\tThis paper is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF-2104662).

The goals of this section will be to construct an algebraic extension using the element \u03c3_n = (1  \u2026  n) of the permutation group acting on n elements, S_n, and to determine the algebraic properties of this extension. \n\t\n\t\tLet \ud835\udd24 be a Lie algebra of dimension n and \u03c3 = (1  \u2026  n) \u2208 S_n where S_n is the permutation group acting on n elements.

For a Milnor frame {X_1, \u2026, X_n} with structure constants \u03bb_1, \u2026, \u03bb_n \u2208 R and i,j \u2208{1, \u2026, n}\n\t\n    [X_i,X_j] = \u03b4_\u03c3(i)j\u03bb_\u03c3^2(i)X_\u03c3^2(i) - \u03b4_i\u03c3(j)\u03bb_\u03c3(i)X_\u03c3(i).\n\n\tIf we let E_ij denote the matrix whose only nonzero coefficient is 1 at the entry (i,j), then for a Milnor frame {X_1, \u2026, X_n} with structure constants {\u03bb_1, \u2026, \u03bb_n}, \n\t\n    _X_i = \u03bb_\u03c3^2(i)E_\u03c3^2(i)\u03c3(i) - \u03bb_\u03c3(i)E_\u03c3(i)\u03c3^-1(i).\n\n\tKnowing these other representations can simplify future computations. \n\t\n\t\tFor the remainder of the paper, E_ij will denote the n\u00d7 n matrix whose entry at (i,j) is 1 with all other entries trivial.\n\t\n\t\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Examples: \ud835\udd25^3 and \ud835\udd25^4\n\n\tWe start with the classic example of a nilpotent Lie algebra with a Milnor frame. \n\t\n\t\tThe 3-dimensional Heisenberg group is a subgroup of M_3( R) whose elements are of the form \n\t\t\n    \u210b = {[ 1 a b; 0 1 c; 0 0 1 ]| a,b,c \u2208 R}.\n\n\t\tThe Lie algebra of \u210b is\n\t\t\n    \ud835\udd25^3 = {[ 0 a b; 0 0 c; 0 0 0 ]| a,b,c \u2208 R}.\n\n\t\tConsider the frame X_1 := E_12, X_2:=E_13 and X_3:= E_23. We obtain the bracket relations [X_1,X_2] = X_3 and all other bracket relations trivial. If \ud835\udd1e is an abelian Lie algebra of dimension n \u2265 1, then \ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd1e forms an n+3-dimensional Lie algebra with a Milnor frame.\n\t \n\t\tNote that \ud835\udd25^3 is 2-step nilpotent as shown below: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t   _X_1 = 0 \n\n\t\t\t   _X_2 = -E_31 ^2_X_2 = E_31^2 = 0 \n\n\t\t\t   _X_3= 0. \n\t\tThis observation will allow us to show that \ud835\udd25^4\u2247\ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd1e.\n\t\n\t\tLet \ud835\udd25^4 be the 4-dimensional Lie algebra with a frame {X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4} and bracket relations \n\t\t\n    [X_1,X_2] = X_3,     [X_2,X_3] = X_4.\n\n\t\tThis Lie algebra is 3-step nilpotent as shown below: \n\t\t\n\t\t\t   _X_1 = E_32 ^2_X_1 = E_32^2 = 0\n\n\t\t\t   _X_2 = E_43 - E_31 _X_2^2 = E_43^2 - E_43E_31 - E_13E_43 + E_13^2 = E_41 \n\n\t\t\t   _X_2^3 = E_41(E_43-E_31) = 0 \n\n\t\t\t   _X_3 = -E_42 _X_3 = E_42^2 = 0 \n\n\t\t\t   _X_4 = 0.  \n\t\t\n\t\tBecause every 2-dimensional Lie algebra is either abelian or non-nilpotent, \ud835\udd25^4 cannot be split into two 2-dimensional Lie algebras. As shown in example\u00a0<ref>, the Lie algebra \ud835\udd25^3 is at most 2-step nilpotent and so \ud835\udd25^4 is not isomorphic to \ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd1e with \ud835\udd1e an abelian Lie algebra of dimension 1. Set F_1 = X_4, F_2 = X_3, F_3 = X_1 and F_4 = X_2. The non-trivial structure constants with respect to the frame {F_1,\u2026, F_4} are C_2,4^1 = -1, C_3,4^2 = 1. By Lemma 3 of\u00a0<cit.>, \ud835\udd25^4 is the unique 3-step Nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension 4. \n\t\t\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Algebraic Properties of Lie Algebras with Milnor Frames\n\n\tGiven a Lie algebra of dimension n \u2265 4 with a Milnor frame the upper bound for the total number of non-zero structure constants is at most n.

Let V = {v_1, \u2026, v_n} and E = {{v_i,v_\u03c3^2(i)}}_i. Note that for each e \u2208 E, e \u2229 V has a vertex v_i such that \u03bb_i = 0. We call this graph a Milnor graph. We will show later that there exists a one-to-one correspondence with Milnor graphs and Lie algebras with Milnor frames. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\tLet A \u2282 V such that for any v_i \u2208 A, \u03bb_i =0 and let B = V  \u2216 A. For each v_i \u2208 B, define the function f: B \u2192 A as v_i \u21a6 v_\u03c3^2(i). This map is well defined and injective so that |B| \u2264 |A|.

Let \ud835\udd24 be a Lie algebra with a Milnor frame and let \ud835\udca2 = (V,E) be the associated Milnor graph. Observe that there are two disjoint cycles (v_1,v_3, \u2026, v_1) and (v_2,v_4, \u2026, v_2). Suppose that \u03bb_1, \u03bb_2 \u2260 0. If B \u2282 V is the set of all vertices v_i such that \u03bb_i \u2260 0, then we may place \u03bb_1, \u03bb_2 \u2208 B, \u03bb_3,\u03bb_4 \u2208 V\u2216 B, and so on. Because 4 | n we will obtain |A| = |B| and so by a previous observation, |B| = n/2 = 4k/2 = 2k for some k \u2208 Z. \n\t\t\n\t\tAs shown previously, Milnor graphs can determine an upper bound on the total number of non-trivial structure constants. We obtain more applications of Milnor graphs if we direct the edges in a natural way.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLet \ud835\udd24 be a Lie algebra with a Milnor frame whose structure constants are \u03bb_1, \u2026, \u03bb_n \u2208 R. Define the directed graph \ud835\udca2 = (V,E) with vertices V = {v_1, \u2026, v_n} and edges E = {(v_i,v_\u03c3^2(i))  1 \u2264 i \u2264 n}. We call \ud835\udca2 the directed Milnor graph with respect to the structure constants \u03bb_1, \u2026, \u03bb_n. \n\t\t\n\t\tThe definition above shows that we may construct a graph which represents a Lie algebra with a Milnor frame. A consequence of Theorem\u00a0<ref> is that each Lie algebra of dimension n \u2265 4 with a Milnor frame has a Milnor frame whose structure constants are either 0 or 1. This observation along with the next proposition will show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between Lie algebras with Milnor frames and their associated Milnor graphs. \n\t\t\n\t\tLet \ud835\udca2 = (V,E) with vertices V = {v_1, \u2026, v_n} and edges E = {(v_i,v_\u03c3^2(i))  1 \u2264 i \u2264 n)}. Suppose A \u2282 V such that \u2200 e \u2208 E, if e = (v_i,v_\u03c3^2(i)) then v_i or v_\u03c3^2(i) is in A.

We may define an algebra with bracket relations [X_i,X_\u03c3(i)] = \u03bb_\u03c3^2(i)X_\u03c3^2(i) with X_1, \u2026, X_n linearly independent and all other bracket relations trivial.

Additionally suppose that v_1,v_2 \u2208 A and w_1,w_2 \u2208 A'. Define \ud835\udca2_1#\ud835\udca2_2 = (V \u222a V', F) to be the graph obtained by deleting the edges (v_n-1, v_1), (v_n, v_2), (w_n-1,w_1), (w_n, w_2) and forming the edges (v_n-1, w_1), (v_n, w_2), (w_m-1, v_1), (w_m, v_2). Through relabeling we let {u_1 = v_1, \u2026, u_n = v_n, u_n+1 = w_1, u_n+m = w_m} = V \u222a V' where one can see F = {(u_i,u_\u03c3^2(i))  1 \u2264 i \u2264 (n+m)}. Furthermore for any f \u2208 F, there exists u_i \u2208 A \u222a A' such that f is (u_i,u_\u03c3^2(i)) or (u_\u03c3^-2(i), u_i) so that \ud835\udca2#\ud835\udca2' is a directed Milnor graph. It turns out if \ud835\udca2 is associated to the Lie algebra \ud835\udd24 and \ud835\udca2' is associated to the Lie algebra \ud835\udd24', then \ud835\udca2' #\ud835\udca2 is associated to the direct sum \ud835\udd24\u2295\ud835\udd24'. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tLet X_1, \u2026, X_n be the Milnor frame constructed from the directed Milnor graph \ud835\udca2 with structure constants {\u03bb_1, \u2026, \u03bb_n} and {Y_1, \u2026, Y_m} be the Milnor frame constructed from the directed Milnor graph \ud835\udca2' with structure constants {\u03b7_1, \u2026, \u03b7_m}. Define W_i = (X_i,0) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and W_n +j = (0,Y_j) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. We claim that {W_k  1 \u2264 k \u2264 n+m} forms a Milnor frame.

This suggests that any Lie algebra with a Milnor frame splits into lower-dimensional Lie algebras with Milnor frames as stated in Theorem\u00a0<ref>. Before we prove Theorem\u00a0<ref> we prove the following lemmas.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLet \ud835\udd24 be a 3 dimensional Lie algebra with a Milnor frame with structure constants \u03bb_i = \u03bb_j = 0 and \u03bb_k \u2260 0 for {i,j,k} = {1,2,3}.

By scaling Y_3 to \u03bb_3Y_3, {Y_1, Y_2, \u03bb_3Y_3} forms a Milnor frame.

If \u03bb_\u03c3(i)\u2260 0 then \u03bb_\u03c3^3(i) = 0 and so _X_\u03c3(i) = 0. Thus \u2200 X \u2208SpanX_\u03c3^-2(i), X_\u03c3^-1(i), X_i, X_\u03c3(i)=:\ud835\udd25_i^4, _X(\ud835\udd25_i^4) \u2282\ud835\udd25_i^4 making \ud835\udd25_i^4 a subalgebra. \n\t\t\n\t\tNow we proceed by induction on the dimension of the Lie algebra. Assume that any Lie algebra of dimension k < n with a Milnor frame splits as stated in the theorem. Let {X_1, \u2026, X_n}, n \u2265 4, be a Milnor frame for the non-abelian Lie algebra \ud835\udd24. Noting that the operator S_k: \ud835\udd24\u2192\ud835\udd24, defined by c^iX_i \u21a6 c^i X_\u03c3^k(i), takes Milnor frames to Milnor frames we may suppose without loss of generality that \u03bb_3 \u2260 0. We have two cases: either \u03bb_4 = 0 or \u03bb_4 \u2260 0. Suppose \u03bb_4 = 0. We show that Span{X_i}_i \u2209{1,2,3} forms a subalgebra. Because _X_i = \u03bb_\u03c3^2(i)E_\u03c3^2(i)\u03c3(i) - \u03bb_\u03c3(i)E_\u03c3(i)\u03c3^-1(i) we only need to consider the collection of i \u2209{1,2,3} such that \u03c3(i),\u03c3^2(i) \u2208{1,2,3}. Because \u03c3(i) = 3  i = 2 and \u03c3^2(i) = 3  i = 1, it must be the case that \u03c3(i), \u03c3^2(i) \u2208{1,2}. Because \u03bb_1 = 0 = \u03bb_2, for any i such that \u03c3(i),\u03c3^2(i) \u2208{1,2,3} \n\t\t\n    _X_i = \u03bb_\u03c3^2(i)E_\u03c3^2(i)\u03c3(i) - \u03bb_\u03c3(i)E_\u03c3(i)\u03c3^-1(i) = 0 .\n\n\t\tThis shows that Span{X_i}_i \u2209{1,2,3} forms a subalgebra. Suppose that \u03bb_4 \u2260 0. We only need to consider the collection of i \u2209{1,2,3,4} such that \u03c3(i), \u03c3^2(i) \u2208{1,2,3,4}. If \u03c3(i), \u03c3^2(i) = 4, then i \u2208{2,3}. So any i \u2209{1,2,3,4}, \u03c3(i), \u03c3^2(i) \u2208{1,2}. Thus _X_i = 0 for any i \u2209{1,2,3,4} with \u03c3(i),\u03c3^2(i) \u2208{1,2,3,4} and so Span{X_i}_i\u2209{1,2,3,4} is a subalgebra. By using the adjoint operator definition of a Milnor frame, one can see that these subalgebras form a Milnor frame.

The Ricci tensor is of the form \n\t\t\t\n    2_g = [  2  1  0  0;  1  0 -1  0;  0 -1 -2  0;  0  0  0 -3 ].\n\n\t\tThe characteristic polynomial of the above matrix is x(x+3)(x^2-6) and so the signature of _g in\u00a0(<ref>) is (-,-,0,+). If g is a Ricci nilsoliton then there exists k \u2208 R such that D:=_g - kI is a derivation.

If we are able to provide a metric that does not allow \ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd25^3 to have an orthogonal Milnor frame, then we obtain Theorem\u00a0<ref> as a result. First we prove the following result from linear algebra. \n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLet A,B \u2208 M_2( R). Denote the i^th column of an arbitrary matrix C \u2208 M_2( R) as C_i. If A and B have the property A_i and B_j are linearly dependent for any i,j \u2208{1,2} then either A or B has determinant 0. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSuppose that A is non-singular. By our hypothesis B_i = c_ijA_j for some c_ij\u2208 R and i,j \u2208{1,2}. Thus \n\t\t\t\n    [ A_1 A_2 ][    0 c_21; c_12    0 ] =\t[ B_1 B_2 ] = [ A_1 A_2 ][ c_11    0;    0 c_22 ].\n\n\t\t\tBecause A is invertible, c_ij = 0 for all i,j which implies B_1 = B_2 = 0. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLet (\ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd25^3, g) be a metric Lie algebra. Let {U_1,U_2,U_3,V_1,V_2,V_3} be a Milnor frame for (\ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd25^3) where \ud835\udd25^3 \u2295{0} = Span{U_1,U_2,U_3} and {0}\u2295\ud835\udd25^3 = Span{V_1,V_2,V_3}. If there exists a Lie isomorphism T such that g(T(\ud835\udd25^3\u2295{0}), T({0}\u2295\ud835\udd25^3)) = 0 then g(U_3,V_3) = 0.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe may always scale the frames {U_1,U_2,U_3} and {V_1,V_2,V_3} so that the structure constants are contained in {0,1}. Without loss of generality we shall assume that the structure constants for the frame {U_1,\u2026, V_3} are contained in {0,1}. Because T is a Lie isomorphism, T_1^iT_2^j[U_i,U_j] = [TU_1,TU_2] = TU_3 = T^k_3U_k. This shows T_3^3 = T_1^1T_2^2 - T_1^2T_2^1, T_3^6 = T_1^4T_2^5- T_1^5T_2^4, and T_3^k = 0 for k = 1,2,4,5. Similarly T_6^3 = T_4^1T_5^2-T_4^2T_5^1, T_6^6 = T_4^4T_5^5 - T_4^5-T_5^4 and T_6^k = 0 for k=1,2,4,5. For i,j such that [P_i,P_j] = 0, P_i,P_j \u2208{U_1, \u2026, V_3}, T_i^1T_j^2 - T_i^2T_j^1 = T_i^4T_j^5 - T_i^5T_j^4 = 0. The matrix representation of T can be given by the block matrix \n\t\t\t\n    T:= [   W   0   X   0; w^t (W) x^t (X);   Y   0   Z   0; y^t (Y) z^t (Z) ]\n\n\t\t\tWhere W,X,Y and Z are 2\u00d7 2 matrices, w,x,y,z are 2\u00d7 1 matrices, and each 0 is a 2 \u00d7 1 matrix. Letting C_i represent the i^th column of a matrix C \u2208 M_2( R), we have the additional property that W_i and X_j are linearly dependent for any i,j and similarly Y_i and Z_j are linearly dependent. Suppose that X is singular. If W or Z is singular then T will be singular leading us to a contradiction. Let W and Z be nonsingular. By Lemma\u00a0<ref> Y is singular.

In order for T to remain non-singular Y must be nonsingular. If we post-compose T with the Lie isomorphism S = [ 0 I; I 0 ] then a similar argument of the case where X is singular holds to show that g(U_3,V_3) = 0. \n\t\t\n\tTaking the contrapositive of the previous theorem states if g(U_3,V_3) \u2260 0, then there are no linear operators T \u2208Aut(\ud835\udd24) such that g(TU_i,TV_j) = 0 \u2200 i,j. \n\t\n\t\n\t\tThere exists a metric g on the Lie algebra (\ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd25^3) such that (\ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd25^3, g) does not admit an orthonormal Milnor frame. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t Let be (\ud835\udd24 = \ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd25^3,g) be a metric Lie algebra with a Milnor frame {X_1, \u2026, X_6} and T: \ud835\udd24\u2192\ud835\udd24 be a linear operator such that {TX_1, \u2026, TX_6} forms a Milnor frame with two non-trivial structure constants. Denote these structure constants as \u03bb_1, \u2026, \u03bb_6 \u2208{0,1}. Then either \u03bb_i = \u03bb_\u03c3(i) = 1, \u03bb_i = \u03bb_\u03c3^2(i) = 1, or \u03bb_i = \u03bb_\u03c3^3(i) =1 for some i \u2208{1,\u2026, 6}. It cannot be the case that \u03bb_i = \u03bb_\u03c3^2(i) = 1 for some i by Proposition\u00a0<ref> which leaves us with two cases. \n\t\n\tIf there is some i such that \u03bb_i = \u03bb_\u03c3(i), then \ud835\udd25^4 \u2282\ud835\udd25^3 \u2295\ud835\udd25^3.
