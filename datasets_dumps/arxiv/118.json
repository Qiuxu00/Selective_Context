The analyzing power A_N is defined as the \nleft-right asymmetry of the produced hadrons with respect to the spin \ndirection of the polarized proton where the polarization direction is \nperpendicular to the beam direction. Since the 1970s, significant TSSAs \nin hadron (h) production (p^\u2191+p\u2192h+X) have been \nmeasured at large Feynman-x (x_F = 2 p_L/\u221a(s)) for a wide \nrange of collision energies up to 500 \nGeV\u00a0<cit.>. \nTwo approaches have been proposed to account for these large \nasymmetries. First, the transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) approach is \nbased on TMD parton distribution and fragmentation functions. It \nrequires two scales, a hard-scattering energy scale Q and a soft scale \nk_T describing the transverse momentum of partons in the proton or of \nhadrons relative to the parent parton in hadronization process, with \nk_T \u226a Q. In this framework, the possible origins of the asymmetry \nare the Sivers\u00a0<cit.> and \nCollins\u00a0<cit.> mechanisms. The Sivers mechanism describes \nthe initial-state correlation between the spin of the transversely \npolarized proton and the parton transverse momentum, while in the final \nstate the Collins mechanism introduces a correlation between the \ntransverse spin of the fragmenting quark and transverse momentum of the \nfinal state hadron.  The Collins mechanism convolves with the quark \ntransversity distribution, which describes the quark transverse \npolarization inside a transversely polarized proton.  Secondly, in the \nother framework, the collinear twist-3 factorization is applicable for \nobservables with one large scale Q, which is usually represented by \nthe particle transverse momentum p_T in reactions such as \np^\u2191+p\u2192h+X. In this framework, the asymmetry arises \nfrom a twist-3 multi-parton correlation function and a twist-3 \nfragmentation function. Twist-3 multi-parton correlation functions \nrepresent a spin dependence of the transverse motion of the parton inside \na polarized \nproton\u00a0<cit.>. \nTwist-3 fragmentation functions denote parton fragmentation effects \nduring the formation of the final state hadrons. Recent calculations of \nthe twist-3 contribution from parton fragmentation are shown to be \nimportant to describe the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) \nresults\u00a0<cit.>. Also, a \nrecent phenomenological study using both TMD and collinear twist-3 \napproaches demonstrates that TSSAs in Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic \nScattering (SIDIS), Drell-Yan, e^+e^- annihilation, and \nproton-proton collisions have a common origin\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nRecently, an exploration of the interplay of spin physics and small-x \nphysics through the measurement of TSSAs in transversely polarized \nproton-nucleus collisions () has attracted attention, where x is \nthe momentum fraction of a proton carried by the parton. In collisions, the properties of small-x gluons inside nuclei can be \nprobed by measuring hadron production in the proton-going direction. The \ngluon density in the small-x region of the target nuclei is expected \nto increase significantly and it may be described by the \ncolor-glass-condensate (CGC) formalism\u00a0<cit.>. The \nframework introduces a characteristic saturation scale Q_s which \ndescribes the color-charge density fluctuations, where Q_sA\u221d \nA^1/3 for the target nucleus. In collisions, measuring TSSAs \ncan be used as a probe for the saturation scale in the \nnucleus\u00a0<cit.>. In addition, TSSAs in the forward region \nfrom collisions help to disentangle differing mechanisms and \nclarify the origin of the TSSA. Previous calculations of TSSAs \nincorporating gluon saturation at small-x suggest that TSSAs in may or may not be A-dependent, depending on the mechanisms \ninvolved\u00a0<cit.>. On the experimental side, \nthe A_N of positively charged hadrons at 0.1<x_F<0.2 in \nPHENIX\u00a0<cit.> and \u03c0^0 results at 0.2<x_F<0.7 in \nSTAR in and collisions have been reported \nrecently\u00a0<cit.>. It should be noted that the kinematic \nregion of the measurements presented here is outside of the expected CGC \nrange, but considerations on the A-dependence of the various \ncontributions might still be relevant.\n\nThis paper reports on measurements in 2015 of the transverse single-spin \nasymmetry for the production of charged hadrons (h^\u00b1) over the \nrange of 1.5<p_T<7.0 GeV/c and 0.04<|x_F|<0.2 at forward and \nbackward rapidity (1.4<|\u03b7|<2.4) from transversely polarized \nproton-proton (), proton-Aluminum (), and proton-Gold \n() collisions at \u221a(s__NN)=200 GeV.\nSection\u00a0<ref> describes the experimental setup in \nPHENIX and the polarized beams at RHIC. The details of the analysis \nprocedure are presented in Sec.\u00a0<ref>, and the result are \nshown in Sec.\u00a0<ref> with discussions in \nSec.\u00a0<ref> and finally, the summary in Sec.\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The PHENIX experiment\n\n\nThe PHENIX detector\u00a0<cit.> is equipped with central arms \nat midrapidity, and muon arms at backward and forward rapidity. The \nmuon arms cover the pseudorapidity range 1.2<\u03b7<2.4 (north arm) and \n-2.2<\u03b7<-1.2 (south arm) and the full azimuthal angle (\u0394\u03d5 \n= 2\u03c0)\u00a0<cit.>. The side view of the PHENIX detector \nincluding muon arms during the 2015 run is shown in \nFig.\u00a0<ref>. Muons and hadrons produced from the interaction \nregion pass through a hadron absorber of 7.5 nuclear interaction lengths \n(\u03bb_I). Surviving muons and hadrons reach a Muon Tracker (MuTr) \ncomposed of three stations of cathode-strip readout tracking chambers \nmounted inside conical-shaped muon magnets. The momentum of a charged \nparticle is measured with the MuTr. The Muon Identifier (MuID) behind \nthe MuTr is composed of five layers (labeled from Gap0 to Gap4) of \nproportional tube planes combined with an absorber plane \n(\u22481\u03bb_I), respectively. The MuID provides identification of \nhadrons and muons by measuring penetration depth. Muons of momentum \nlarger than 3 GeV/c penetrate all layers while charged hadrons are \nmostly stopped at the intermediate layers (Gap2 and \nGap3)\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nThe Beam-Beam Counters (BBC) are located at z=\u00b1144\u00a0 cm from the \ninteraction point and cover the pseudorapidity range 3.1<|\u03b7|<3.9 \nand full azimuthal angle\u00a0<cit.>. Each BBC comprises 64 \nquartz \u010cerenkov counters. The BBC detects charged particles and \nprovides z-vertex position with a resolution about 2 cm in collisions. The BBC is also used to categorize events with energy \ndeposition in terms of centrality for collisions with ion beam. In the \ncase of and collisions, energy deposition in the \nA-going direction is used for determining centrality. In addition, the \nBBC serves as a luminosity monitor.\n\nThe minimum-bias trigger provided by the BBC requires at least one \nhit in both directions. The BBC trigger efficiency is 55% in , \n72% in , and 84% in collisions. The MuID provides a \ntrigger to select events containing hadron or muon tracks by requiring \nat least one MuID track reaching Gap2, Gap3 or Gap4. For charged \nhadrons, events with track candidates having a hit at the Gap2 or Gap3 \nbut no hit at the Gap4 are selected. The new readout electronics for the \nMuTr allow to trigger events with high momentum (p_T>3\u00a0 GeV/c) \ntracks by requiring maximum bending at the middle plane less than 3 MuTr \ncathode strips\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 RHIC polarized beams\n\n\nRHIC is the world's first and only polarized proton collider, located at \nBrookhaven National Laboratory, comprising two counter-circulating \nstorage rings. In each ring, as many as 120 bunches of heavy ions or \npolarized protons can be accelerated up to 100 GeV for heavy ions and \n255 GeV for polarized protons. During the 2015 run period, data from the \ncollisions of vertically polarized protons and ions (, , \nand ) at \u221a(s__NN)=200 GeV were recorded. The polarization \ndirection of the colliding bunches altered every bunch crossing (106\u00a0ns \ninterval) to minimize systematic effects due to time dependence of the \ndetector and accelerator performance. In the run, the \ncounterclockwise direction was selected for ion beams.\n\nThe average polarization of the proton beam was 58% (clockwise beam) \nand 57% (counterclockwise beam) for collisions, 58% for collisions, and 61% for collisions with 3% relative \nuncertainty from the polarization normalization\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DATA ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Data Set\n\n\nThe integrated luminosity of the data in this analysis is \n37\u00a0pb^-1 from , 593\u00a0nb^-1 from , \nand 112\u00a0nb^-1 from collisions. The data was \nrecorded using the hadron trigger in combination with the BBC trigger. \nThe hadron trigger selected high-momentum tracks stopped at MuID Gap2 or \nGap3, with the bending at the middle plane of MuTr being less than 3 \ncathode strips\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Charged Hadron Selection\n\n\nAmong the reconstructed tracks stopped at MuID Gap2 or Gap3 are low \nmomentum muons from light hadron decays. From full geant4 \nsimulation studies, such background is significantly suppressed (<5%) \nafter applying a cut p_z>3.5  GeV/c\u00a0<cit.>. The \nadditional p_T dependent track quality cuts are listed in \nTable\u00a0<ref> with numerical values shown for Gap3 tracks \nat 1.25<p_T<1.5\u00a0 GeV/c. The distance and angular difference \nbetween the extrapolated MuTr track and the MuID track at the first MuID \nplane's z position are called DG0 and DDG0. The distance between the \ninteraction point and a projected position of a MuID track at z=0 is \nr_ ref. The number of hits in a MuTr track and \u03c7^2 per \ndegree of freedom (\u03c7^2_ MuTr/ndf) are also included in the \ntrack quality cut. The polar scattering angle of a track inside the \nabsorber scaled by the momentum is p\u00b7(\u03b8_ MuTr - \n\u03b8_ vtx) where the angle at the vertex is \u03b8_ vtx \nand the angle at the MuTr Station 1 is \u03b8_ MuTr. Cuts applied \nto p\u00b7(\u03b8_ MuTr - \u03b8_ vtx) and \u03c7^2 at \nz_ vtx are effective for rejecting muons decayed inside the \nabsorber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimation of the particle composition in the measured charged hadron \nsample was developed in \u00a0<cit.>. Based on \npythia\u00a0<cit.> and hijing\u00a0<cit.> event generators, charged hadron spectra \nmeasured at midrapidity in and at \nRHIC\u00a0<cit.> were extrapolated \nto the PHENIX muon arm rapidity (1.2<\u03b7<2.4) for , , and collisions. According to a geant4\u00a0<cit.> detector \nsimulation (release 10.0.p02), the initial particle composition is \nmodified due to interaction with the detector material including the \nfront absorber. The reconstructed charged hadrons are mostly K^\u00b1 \nand \u03c0^\u00b1 where others (p, p\u0305) are less than 10%. The \nestimated K/\u03c0 ratios at the collision vertex and reconstructed \nratios from the simulation are shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref> \nfor collisions and Fig.\u00a0<ref> for collisions. K/\u03c0 ratios in and collisions are consistent \nwith each other in the hijing simulation. Among the geant4 \nphysics lists\u00a0<cit.>, the QGSP-BERT is used as the \ndefault. To simulate hadronic interactions it applies the quark gluon \nstring model for high energy and the Bertini cascade model for low \nenergy hadrons. To estimate possible variations, the FTFP-BERT and \nQGSP-BIC physics lists are used where the FTF model uses the FRITIOF \ndescription of string excitation and fragmentation and BIC uses the \nbinary cascade model. The variations from the different physics lists in \nthe geant4 simulation are shown as the bands on the reconstructed \nK/\u03c0 ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Determination of the TSSA\n\n\nThe unbinned maximum-likelihood method was used to extract the TSSA \n(A_N) in this study. It was established in the previous study which \nused the same \ndetectors\u00a0<cit.>. The \nmethod is robust even for low-statistics data compared to binned \napproaches. The extended log-likelihood log\u2112 is defined as\n\n\n    log\u2112 = \u2211_i log(1 + P \u00b7 A_N sin(\u03d5_ pol - \u03d5_h^i)) + constant,\n\n\nwhere P is the proton beam polarization and \u03d5_h^i is \nthe azimuthal angle of the i-th hadron with respect to the incoming \npolarized-proton-beam direction. The \u03d5_ pol is the azimuthal \nangle for the beam polarization direction, which takes the values of \n+\u03c0/2/-\u03c0/2 for \u2191/\u2193 polarized beam \nbunches in 2015. The A_N is chosen to be the value which maximizes \nlog\u2112. The statistical uncertainty of the log-likelihood \nestimator is calculated from the second derivative of \u2112 with \nrespect to A_N,\n\n\n    \u03c3^2(A_N) = (-\u2202^2 \u2112/\u2202 A_N^2)^-1.\n\n\nIn p+p collisions, both beams were polarized. The A_Ns were measured \nseparately for each beam and turned out to be consistent with each \nother. They were averaged for the final asymmetry.\n\nThe A_N is checked with the azimuthal-fitting method used in previous \nanalyses\u00a0<cit.> \nbased on the polarization formula\u00a0<cit.>:\n\n    A_N(\u03d5)=\u03c3^\u2191(\u03d5)-\u03c3^\u2193(\u03d5)/\u03c3^\u2191(\u03d5)+\u03c3^\u2193(\u03d5)\n    \n    =1/P\u00b7N^\u2191(\u03d5)\n    -R\u00b7 N^\u2193(\u03d5)/N^\u2191(\u03d5)\n    +R\u00b7 N^\u2193(\u03d5),\n\nwhere A_N(\u03d5) indicates the simple-count-based transverse \nsingle-spin asymmetry calculated for each of 16 azimuthal \u03d5-bins; \n\u03c3^\u2191, \u03c3^\u2193 represent cross sections; \nand N^\u2191, N^\u2193 are yields for each polarization of \nspin up (\u2191) or down (\u2193). R = \nL^\u2191/L^\u2193 is the ratio of luminosities (relative \nluminosity) between bunches with spin up and spin down where the luminosity \nis determined by sampled counts from minimum-bias triggers for the \ncorresponding spin orientation. The A_N in this method is calculated from \nthe fit of A_N(\u03d5) distributions using a function A_N\u00b7sin(\u03d5_ pol\u2191 - \u03d5) where \u03d5_ pol \n\u2191=\u03c0/2 indicates the azimuthal direction of upward polarized \nbunches. The difference of the A_N's for this method and the \nmaximum-likelihood method is conservatively included in the systematic \nuncertainty.\n\nThe interactions between particles and material prior to being detected \nby the MuTr, and the finite resolution for momentum and azimuthal angle \n\u03d5, may result in a kinematic smearing effect for the A_N results. \nThe full geant4 simulation is used to correct this effect. The \neffect from \u03d5 smearing was found to be negligible.\n\n\n\n\nThe momentum smearing is shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>; for \neach bin of reconstructed x_F is shown the probability distribution of \ngenerated x_F that contribute to each reconstructed bin. The momentum \nsmearing effect is corrected by resolving a set of linear equations \nwhich connect A_N for reconstructed x_F (p_T) bins \n(A_N^ reco) and A_N for true (generated) x_F (p_T) bins \n(A_N^ true):\n\n    A_N^ reco, m =  \u2211_i f^i \u2192 m\u00b7 A_N^ true, i,\n\nwhere A_N^ true, i represents A_N for the i-th true \nmomentum (x_F, p_T) bin and A_N^ reco, m is A_N for the \nreconstructed momentum in the m-th momentum bin. f^i \u2192 m \nis the fraction of charged hadrons reconstructed in the m-th momentum \nbin from the i-th true (generated) momentum bin in the simulation. \nA_N^ reco is measured including an underflow and overflow bin for \n0.035<x_F<0.3 and 1.25<p_T<15 GeV/c, and then A_N^ true \nis calculated for 0.04<x_F<0.2 and 1.5<p_T<7 GeV/c. The \ndifference between A_N^ reco and A_N^ true was found to be \nsmall, and was conservatively included in systematic uncertainties. The \nvariation of A_N due to muon contribution is minimal (<0.0005) and \nnot included in the systematic uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RESULTS\n \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results in Proton-Proton Collisions\n\n\nThe TSSAs in the production of charged hadrons at in \ntransversely-polarized proton-proton collisions () are shown in \nFig.\u00a0<ref> as a function of p_T and in \nFig.\u00a0<ref> as a function of x_F. The vertical bars \nrepresent statistical uncertainties and the boxes are systematic \nuncertainties. A scale uncertainty from the polarization (3%) is not \nincluded. The results are listed in \nTables\u00a0<ref>,\u00a0<ref>,\u00a0<ref>, \nand\u00a0<ref>. In the tables, \u03b4 A_N^ stat is \nthe statistical uncertainty, and \u03b4 A_N^ syst is the total \nsystematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty is obtained from the \nquadratic sum of two components (\u03b4 A_N^ method and \u03b4 \nA_N^ smear). As explained in the previous section, \u03b4 \nA_N^ method is the difference between the two methods of \ndetermining A_N, while \u03b4 A_N^ smear is the difference \ncaused by the momentum migration correction (Eq.\u00a0<ref>). \nThree different physics lists are tested in the correction and the \nvariation among them is negligible.\n\nOn the panel (a) of Fig.\u00a0<ref>, A_N at backward rapidity \n(x_F<0) for charged hadrons is consistent with zero within \nuncertainty. On the panel (b), A_N at forward rapidity (x_F>0) is \npositive for positively-charged hadrons. Positive asymmetry is also \nshown in the x_F-binned result in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. A_N \nfor positively-charged hadrons at x_F>0 shows an increasing trend with \nrespect to x_F. The result for negatively-charged hadrons shows some \nindication of negative A_N around x_F>0.07.\n\nThe previous results at RHIC energies with larger |x_F| and |\u03b7| \nthan this measurement showed positive A_N for \u03c0^+, K^\u00b1 and \nnegative A_N for \u03c0^- at x_F>0. The size of A_N increases \nas a function of x_F at x_F>0. In negative x_F region, A_N \nis consistent with zero. In this measurement, the result for h^+ is \ncomparable with A_N for \u03c0^+, K^+. A_N for h^+ is \nincreasing as a function of x_F at x_F>0 and is consistent with zero \nat x_F<0. \u03c0^- and K^- in the previous measurements showed \nthe opposite sign of A_N at forward rapidity. Therefore one may expect \nthe A_N for h^- has been partially canceled and this can explain \nthe smaller size of A_N for h^- at x_F>0 in \nFig.\u00a0<ref>. This is also confirmed in twist-3 model \ncalculations shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>. The dotted bands in \nFig.\u00a0<ref> are obtained from K/\u03c0 ratios in the \nsimulation combined with theoretical A_N for charged pions and kaons \nfrom twist-3 calculation for x_F>0.15\u00a0<cit.>, which \ndescribes previous RHIC results at forward \nrapidity\u00a0<cit.>. In addition, the effect of \nthe K/\u03c0 production ratio variation is tested for a relative \u00b1 \n30% variation and the width of the band shows the possible variation \nof A_N mixture for h^+ and h^-. The variation of the K/\u03c0 \nproduction ratio from different geant4 physics lists shown in \nFig.\u00a0<ref> is much smaller than the relative \u00b1 \n30% that was considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results in Proton-Nucleus Collisions\n\n\nThe A_N results of charged hadrons in proton-nucleus collisions \n(and ) are shown in \nFig.\u00a0<ref>,\u00a0<ref>, \nand\u00a0<ref> with results and listed in \nTables\u00a0<ref>,\u00a0<ref>,\n\u00a0<ref>, \nand\u00a0<ref> for and \n<ref>,\u00a0<ref>,\u00a0<ref>, \nand\u00a0<ref> for . Results at x_F<0 in all \ncollision systems (, ) are consistent with zero within total \nuncertainty. Results for negatively-charged hadrons from and \ncollisions shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref> and \n<ref> are also consistent with zero within total \nuncertainty, while A_N in collisions shows some indication of \nnegative asymmetry at p_T<3.5  GeV/c on panel (b) \n(x_F>0) of Fig.\u00a0<ref> and at 0.07<x_F<0.10 on \npanel (a) of Fig.\u00a0<ref>. However, the difference of \nA_N between and is not significant to state any \nmodification of |A_N| in compared to results.\n\nThe A_N for positively-charged hadrons at x_F>0 in  \ncollisions is consistent with zero while the results for represents a positive asymmetry on panel (b) in Fig.\u00a0<ref> \nand on panel (b) in Fig.\u00a0<ref>.  The \nresults for h^+ at x_F>0 show some indication of a \npositive asymmetry, which is smaller than in collisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISCUSSION\n\n\n\nThe results for the production of positively-charged hadrons (h^+) \nin collisions agree with a trend with other RHIC data where \nA_N for \u03c0^+ and K^+ is positive and increasing with \nrespect to x_F in the forward region \n(x_F>0)\u00a0<cit.>. The results for A_N for \nnegatively-charged hadrons (h^-) range from slightly negative to \nzero at x_F>0; this may be caused by cancellation between positive \nasymmetry for K^- and negative asymmetry for \u03c0^- shown in RHIC \ndata at larger x_F\u00a0<cit.>. These agree \nwith the trend of the theoretical calculation at \nx_F>0.15\u00a0<cit.>. In all collision systems, A_N at \nbackward rapidity (x_F<0) is consistent with zero asymmetry within \ntotal uncertainty, which also has been shown in previous RHIC \nmeasurements in collisions \n\u00a0<cit.>. In the A_N of \npositively charged hadrons measured from and , the \nnuclear dependence is evident in the range 0.1<x_F<0.2 where the \nnonzero asymmetry in contrasts to the approximately zero A_N \nin collisions; likewise, A_N in is smaller than \nA_N in . The A-dependence of A_N at 0.1<x_F<0.2 was \nfound to be consistent with A_N\u221d A^-\u03b1/3 in our previous \npublication\u00a0<cit.> where \n\u03b1= 1.10^+0.69_-0.36(stat)^+0.06_-0.05(sys).\n\nRecent calculations using collinear factorization on polarized proton \n(p^\u2191) and the CGC framework on nuclear target \n(A)\u00a0<cit.> predicted that the A_N of inclusive \nhadrons at forward rapidity in collisions has two contributions \nwhere one is A-independent and the other is \nA^-1/3-dependent\u00a0<cit.>. \nHowever, the A^-1/3-dependent term is dominant for p_T less than \nQ_s and A-independent term is dominant for higher p_T. In the \nkinematics of this measurement according to a recent \ncalculation\u00a0<cit.>, Q_s^ Au\u2248 0.9 GeV whereas \nour measurements correspond to \u27e8 p_T\u27e9\u2248 2.9  \nGeV/c at 0.1<x_F<0.2. An approach using lensing mechanism predicts \nthat A_N decreases as the atomic number of the target (A) \nincreases for k_T below or near Q_s\u00a0<cit.>.  A \nrecent STAR result of \u03c0^0 in the more forward region at \n2.6<\u03b7<4.0, p_T>1.5\u00a0 GeV/c, and 0.2<x_F<0.7 in and \ncollisions shows a smaller A-dependence than what is observed \nhere\u00a0<cit.>. Given that our measurement and that from STAR \nused different kinematic ranges and hadron species, further detailed \nstudies of various observables within a wide kinematic range will be \ninformative on the origin of A_N and its interplay with small-x \nphenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\nReported here are the transverse single-spin asymmetry (A_N) of \npositively and negatively charged hadrons (h^\u00b1) in forward and \nbackward rapidity (1.4<|\u03b7|<2.4) over the range of 1.5<p_T<7.0 \n GeV/c and 0.04<|x_F|<0.2 from transversely polarized \nproton-proton () and proton-nucleus () collisions. The \nresults at x_F<0 are consistent with zero at all systems. In \nx_F>0, negative charged hadron results show small to zero A_N in \ncollisions and zero A_N in collisions. A_N for \npositively charged hadrons increases to positive values as x_F \nincreases in collisions, but results show suppression of \nA_N at 0.1<x_F<0.2 compared to the result. The results \nwill aid in understanding of the origin of A_N and offer a tool to \ninvestigate nuclear effects and phenomena in small-x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe thank the staff of the Collider-Accelerator and Physics\nDepartments at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the staff of\nthe other PHENIX participating institutions for their vital\ncontributions.  \nWe also thank D.
