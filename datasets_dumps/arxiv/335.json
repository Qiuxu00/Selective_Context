A state feedback result is given for synthesising a controller for a plant such that a given closed-loop transfer function is strictly negative imaginary with a prescribed degree of stability. By varying a parameter, the placement of the closed-loop system poles can be adjusted to give a prescribed degree of stability. We show the achievable degree of stability is related to the zero locations of the transfer function from the control input to the disturbance output of the nominal plant being controlled. Moreover, we offer results that outline the largest degree of stability that can be achieved for systems with distinct eigenvalues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe theory of negative imaginary (NI) systems is broadly applicable to problems of robust vibration control for flexible structures; e.g., see <cit.>. In these control systems, unmodelled spillover dynamics can degrade control system performance or lead to instability if the controller is not designed to be robust against this type of uncertainty. NI systems theory provides a way analyzing robustness and designing robust controllers for such flexible structures in the case of collocated force actuators and position sensors; e.g., see <cit.>. Motivated by the robust stability properties of NI systems, research has been made into controller synthesis results with the aim of creating a closed-loop system with the NI or SNI property <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the state feedback negative imaginary control problem as illustrated in Figure <ref>. In this control problem, the unmodelled flexible dynamics are represented by the plant uncertainty \u0394(s) which are assumed to have the NI or SNI property. This is a natural assumption in the control of flexible structures, since it is known that any flexible structure with collocated force inputs and position outputs will have the NI property; e.g., see <cit.>. The (strictly) NI state feedback control problem is concerned with synthesising a state feedback control law u = Kx, such that the corresponding closed-loop system will be guaranteed to have the (strictly) NI property\n\n\n\nOne method of approaching the SNI state feedback control problem has been to form a controller using the solution to a certain algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) <cit.>. However, it has been shown that the associated ARE used in these results does not have a stabilizing solution <cit.>. To avoid the computation complexity of solving this ARE, <cit.> proposed a controller synthesis approach using the solution to an algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) that could be obtained by solving two Lyapunov equations. The approach was computationally efficient, but yielded a closed-loop pole at the origin, ensuring a marginally stable closed-loop system. This pole at the origin was problematic, as in vibration control problems for flexible structures, pole placement is related to the degree of damping achieved for the nominal resonant modes. \n\n\n\n\nThe papers <cit.> modified the approach of <cit.> using a perturbation applied to the plant matrix of the nominal system in order to ensure asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The perturbation achieved closed-loop asymptotic stability. However, it was not proven that the closed-loop system retained the NI property after such a perturbation. The paper <cit.> then showed that under suitable assumptions, the perturbation approach of <cit.> did in fact lead to an SNI closed-loop system and by varying the perturbation parameter, the closed-loop poles of the system could be shifted further into the complex plane, resulting in a prescribed degree of stability. The Lyapunov equations used in forming the controller in this approach also depend on the perturbation parameter. As a consequence, there are choices of this parameter that result in the equations no longer being solvable. This puts a limit on the degree of stability that can be achieved.\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we focus on SISO systems and build on the results of <cit.> to study the achievable degree of stability of an SNI closed-loop system formed using the perturbation approach of <cit.>. This issue is important since closed-loop degree of stability is a key performance measure in vibration control problems for flexible structures. Our main results show that the achievable degree of stability for a given system is limited by the eigenvalues of a certain matrix that is related to the zeros of the transfer function from the control input to the disturbance output of the nominal system. Under suitable assumptions, we quantify how the perturbation approach of <cit.> effects this matrix, and the maximum degree of stability that can be achieved before we can no longer guarantee the SNI property of the closed-loop system.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS\n\nIn this section, we briefly present definitions for both negative imaginary and strictly negative imaginary systems.\n\nFirst consider the linear time-invariant (LTI) system,\n\n    \u1e8b(t)    =    Ax(t) + Bu(t), \n    \n    \ty(t)    =    Cx(t) + Du(t),\n\nwhere A \u2208\u211d^n \u00d7 n, B \u2208\u211d^n \u00d7 m, C \u2208\u211d^m \u00d7 n and D \u2208\u211d^m \u00d7 m.\n\nThe following two definitions relate to the NI and SNI properties of the transfer function matrix G(s) = C(sI - A)^-1B+D corresponding to the system (<ref>). We do not consider a direct feed-through term from disturbance to output in this work.\n\n\n\n\n  A square transfer function matrix G(s) is NI if the following conditions are satisfied <cit.>:\n\t\n\t\t\n  * G(s) has no pole in Re[s]>0.\n\n\t\t\n  * For all \u03c9\u2265 0 such that jw is not a pole of G(s), j(G(j\u03c9) - G(j\u03c9)^*) \u2265 0.\n\n\t\t\n  * If s=j\u03c9_0, \u03c9_0 > 0 is a pole of G(s) then it is a simple pole. Furthermore, if s=j\u03c9_0, \u03c9_0 > 0 is a pole of G(s), then the residual matrix K = lim_s \u2192 j\u03c9_0 (s-j\u03c9_0)jG(s) is positive semidefinite Hermitian.\n\n\t\t\n  * If s=0 is a pole of G(s), then it is either a simple pole or a double pole. If it is a double pole, then, lim_s \u2192 0 s^2G(s) \u2265 0.\n\t\n\n\n\n\nAlso, an LTI system (<ref>) is said to be NI if the corresponding transfer function matrix G(s) = C(sI-A)^-1B + D is NI.\n\n\n\n \nA square transfer function matrix G(s) is SNI if the following conditions are satisfied <cit.>:\n\t\n\t\t\n  * G(s) has no poles in Re[s] \u2265 0.\n\n\t\t\n  * For all \u03c9 > 0 such that jw is not a pole of G(s), j(G(j\u03c9) - G(j\u03c9)^*) > 0.\n\t\n\n\n\nAlso, an LTI system (<ref>) is said to be SNI if the corresponding transfer function matrix G(s) = C(sI-A)^-1B + D is SNI.\n\n\n(<cit.>)  Suppose the system (<ref>) is a given state space realization with R = CB + B^TC^T > 0 and D=D^T. If there exists a real P=P^T\u22650 such that\n\t\n    PA + A^TP + (CA - B^TP)^TR^-1(CA-B^TP) = 0\n\n\twith \u03c3(A-BR^-1(CA-B^TP))\u2282\u2102_\u2264 0. Then, the state space realization and corresponding transfer function is NI.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 STRICTLY NEGATIVE IMAGINARY STATE FEEDBACK\n\n\nIn this paper are concerned with the use of state feedback control to achieve a closed-loop system which is SNI and has a prescribed degree of stability. Moreover, we are concerned with how stable can we make the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system while maintaining the SNI property. In this section, we introduce the SNI state feedback control problem along with the state feedback results of the papers <cit.>. In addition to this we  will introduce supporting lemmas that contextualise the perturbation method used in the state feedback theorem of <cit.>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Problem Formulation\n\n\nFor the SNI state feedback method we will consider in this paper, we require the following controlled linear state space system:\n\n    \u1e8b   = Ax + B_1w + B_2u, \n    \n    \tz          = C_1x,\n\nwhere A \u2208\u211d^n \u00d7 n, B_1 \u2208\u211d^n \u00d7 m, B_2 \u2208\u211d^n \u00d7 m, and C_1 \u2208\u211d^m \u00d7 n. This system corresponds to the nominal plant transfer function matrix G(s) in Figure <ref>.\n\nIf we apply a state feedback control law u=Kx to this system, the corresponding closed-loop system has state space representation\n\n    \u1e8b   = (A + B_2K)x + B_1w, \n    \n    \tz          = C_1x,\n\nwith corresponding closed-loop transfer function G_cl(s) = C_1(sI - A - B_2K)^-1B_1. \n\n\n\n\nWe assume that the system (<ref>) satisfies the following assumptions.\n\n  \n  The matrix C_1B_2 is non-singular.\n\n\n  \n  The matrix R = C_1B_1 + B_1^TC_1^T > 0.\t\n\nAssumption <ref> is essential for ensuring the existence of the controller in the state feedback theorem that will follow. Assumption <ref> is necessary to ensure the invertability of a certain matrix in several of the proofs that follow.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Preliminary Results\n\n\nWe now introduce three results that are needed to understand the SNI state feedback theorem discussed in this paper. Firs,t we will introduce a lemma that details the behavior of NI systems under an \u03f5I perturbation applied to the plant matrix. Then, we present a Schur decomposition applied to a matrix that is used in controller synthesis to avoid the potential computational difficulties of solving an ARE that does not have a stabilizing solution. In the third result, we remark that the eigenvalues of the matrix used in the Schur decomposition actually corresponds to the zeros of a certain related transfer function. Our main results will show that these eigenvalues dictate the maximum degree of stability that the closed-loop system can achieve under SNI state feedback.\n\n\n\n\n  Suppose the system (<ref>) is a given state space realization with m=1 and an NI transfer function G(s). Then the perturbed state space realization [ A-\u03f5 I   B\nC   D ] will be SNI for all \u03f5 > 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now introduce the matrix\n\n    A_r    = Q(A+\u03f5 I) = A_q + \u03f5 Q.\n\nwhere \n\n    Q    = I-B_2(C_1B_2)^-1C_1, \n    \n      \tA_q    = QA,\n\nand \u03f5 > 0 is a parameter which will determine the degree of stability of the closed-loop system in the SNI state feedback theorem of the next subsection. The matrix A_r is fundamental to the state feedback theorem that follows and is discussed further in Remark\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying a real Schur decomposition to the matrix A_r as in (<ref>), we may take the orthogonal matrix U and construct the following matrices:\n \n\t\n    \u00c3   = U^TA_rU =\n    \t\t[ \u00c3_11   \u00c3_12\n    \n    \t\t\t\t0    \u00c3_22 ], \n    B\u0303   = U^TB_1 =\n    \t\t[ B\u0303_11\n    B\u0303_22 ], \n    C\u0303   = U^T(B_2(C_1B_2)^-1 - B_1R^-1) =\n    \t\t[ C\u0303_11\n    C\u0303_22 ], \n    Z\u0303   = U^TZU = B\u0303R^-1B\u0303^T - C\u0303RC\u0303^T = [ Z\u0303_11   Z\u0303_12\n    Z\u0303_21   Z\u0303_22 ],\n\n\nwhere \u00c3_11 has all of its eigenvalues in the closed left half of the complex plane and \u00c3_22 is an anti-stable matrix; i.e., \u03c3(\u00c3_22) \u2282{s:Re[s]>0}. Here, U is an orthogonal matrix dependent on \u03f5 and is obtained through the real Schur transformation; see Section 5.4 of <cit.>. Also, \n\n    Z    = B_1(B_2^TC_1^T)^-1B_2^T + B_2(C_1B_2)^-1B_1^T \n                    - B_2(C_1B_2)^-1R(B_2^TC_1^T)^-1B_2^T.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nNote that the choice of matrix A_r for the Schur decomposition above is not arbitrary. The eigenvalues of A_q correspond to the zeros of the transfer function from u to z in (<ref>), plus a zero at the origin. To see this, set w\u2261 0 and note that (<ref>) implies\n\n    \u017c = C_1Ax+C_1B_2u.\n\nSince (C_1B_2) is invertible by assumption, we can rearrange (<ref>) to write\n\n    u = (C_1B_2)^-1\u017c - (C_1B_2)^-1C_1Ax.\n\nNow, we can substitute (<ref>) into (<ref>) to give\n\n    \u1e8b   = Ax + B_2(C_1B_2)^-1\u017c- B_2(C_1B_2)^-1C_1Ax \n       = (A- B_2(C_1B_2)^-1C_1A)x + B_2(C_1B_2)^-1\u017c\n       = A_qx + B_2(C_1B_2)^-1\u017c.\n\nThese equations define the inverse system which maps from \u017c to u. Considering the Laplace transform of \u017c, suppose z(0)=0 and observe that \u2112(\u017c) = s\u2112(z) + z(0). Thus, the eigenvalues of A_q will be the zeros of the transfer function from u to z plus a zero at zero.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Negative Imaginary State Feedback\n\n\nIn this section we introduce the SNI state feedback theorem that we will be analysing in our main result to determine the degree of stability that can be achieved. This theorem can be found in <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n Consider the  system (<ref>) with m=1 satisfying Assumptions A1-A2. For a given \u03f5 > 0, there exists a static state feedback matrix K such that the closed-loop system (<ref>) is SNI with degree of stability \u03f5 if there exist  T \u2265 0 and S \u2265 0 such that\n\t\n    -\u00c3_22T - T\u00c3_22^T + C\u0303_22RC\u0303_22^T    = 0, \n    \n    \t\t-\u00c3_22S - S\u00c3_22^T + B\u0303_22R^-1B\u0303_22^T    = 0, \n    \n    \t\tT-S    > 0,\n\n\twhere \u00c3_22, B\u0303_22 and C\u0303_22 are obtained from the Schur decomposition (<ref>). Moreover, if the conditions (<ref>)-(<ref>) are satisfied, then the required state feedback controller matrix K is given by\n\t\n    K = (C_1B_2)^-1(B_1^TP - C_1A - \u03f5 C_1 - R(B_2^TC_1^T)^-1B_2^TP),\n where P = UP\u0303U^T and P\u0303 = [ 0   0\n0   (T-S)^-1 ]\u2265 0. Here, U is the orthogonal matrix obtained through the Schur transformation (<ref>).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the A_q matrix from the Schur decomposition (<ref>) has no unstable eigenvalues, the dimension of \u00c3_22 is equal to zero. Therefore, we cannot form (<ref>)-(<ref>). This situation corresponds to the case in which the transfer function from u to y in (<ref>) is minimum phase. This case is also considered in the paper <cit.> for the special case of B_1= B_2 in (<ref>). The following theorem is a minor result that allows us to use SNI state feedback in the case in which the transfer function from u to y in (<ref>) is minimum phase.\n\n\n\n\n Consider the  system (<ref>) with m=1 that satisfies Assumptions A1-A2. Suppose the matrix A_q, obtained from the Schur decomposition (<ref>) has no unstable eigenvalues. For a given \u03f5 > 0 such that the corresponding matrix A_r also has no unstable eigenvalues, there exists a static state feedback matrix K such that the closed-loop system (<ref>) is SNI with degree of stability \u03f5. The required state feedback controller matrix K is given by\n\t\n    K = -(C_1B_2)^-1(C_1A + \u03f5 C_1 ).\n \n\n\n\n\n\nProof of Theorem <ref>: \n\tFor design purposes we will begin by replacing the open loop plant matrix A with the perturbed matrix A_\u03f5 = A + \u03f5I. Now, using Lemma\u00a0<ref>, we know that the closed-loop system (<ref>) is NI if there exists a real P=P^T\u22650 such that\n\t\n    P\u00c2 + \u00c2^TP + PB_1R^-1B_1^TP + Q = 0\n\n\twhere\n\t\n    \u00c2   = A_cl - B_1R^-1C_1A_cl,    \n    \t\tR     = C_1B_1 + B_1^TC_1^T, \n    \n    \t\tQ    = A_cl^TC_1^TR^-1C_1A_cl,    \n    \t\tA_cl   = A_\u03f5 + B_2K,\n\n\twith \u03c3(A_cl-B_1R^-1(CA_cl-B^TP)) \u2282\u2102_\u2264 0. \n\t\n\tLet P=0. Then, (<ref>) reduces to the condition\n\t\n    A_cl^TC_1^TR^-1C_1A_cl = 0.\n\n\tWe will consider the matrix C_1A_cl. For our choice of K, and noting that for a SISO system, (C_1B_2) is a scalar, C_1A_cl = A+\u03f5 I + B_2K reduces to\n\t\n    C_1A_cl   = C_1A+\u03f5 C_1 -C_1B_2(C_1B_2)^-1(C_1A + \u03f5 C_1) = 0\n\n\tTherefore, P=0 satisfies (<ref>). We will now show that \u03c3(A_cl-B_1R^-1(CA_cl-B^TP)) \u2282\u2102_\u2264 0. We begin by considering A_cl-B_1R^-1(CA_cl-B_1^TP). When P=0, and substituting for K = -(C_1B_2)^-1(C_1A + \u03f5 C_1 ) in this expression, we see that\n\t\n    A_cl-B_1R^-1(CA_cl-B_1^TP) =    A_cl-B_1R^-1CA_cl\n    \n    \t\t\n             \n            \n    \t\t=    A_\u03f5 - B_2(C_1B_2)^-1C_1A_\u03f5\n    \n    \t\t=    A_r,\n\n\twhere A_r is defined in (<ref>).\n\tThus, (<ref>) implies\n\t\n    \u03c3(A_cl-BR^-1(CA_cl-B^TP)) =   \u03c3(A_r).\n\n\tSince \u03c3(A_r)\u2282\u2102_\u2264 0 follows from our assumption that A_r has no unstable eigenvalues, we have \u03c3(A_cl-BR^-1(CA_cl-B^TP)) \u2282\u2102_\u2264 0. Therefore, it follows from Lemma\u00a0<ref> that the closed-loop system is NI. Further, Lemma\u00a0<ref> then implies that the actual closed-loop system corresponding to the unperturbed system will have all its poles shifted by an amount \u03f5 to the left in the complex plane. Moreover, the actual closed-loop system is SNI with degree of stability \u03f5.\n\u25aa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE ACHIEVABLE DEGREE OF STABILITY\n\n\nThis section contains the main results of this paper and provides a solution to the maximum degree of stability that can be achieved using Theorem\u00a0<ref> to design a controller for SNI state feedback. This section is broken into two subsections. The first offers preliminary results needed in the proofs of the main results. In the second subsection, we offer two results that outline the maximum degree of stability that can be achieved using Theorem\u00a0<ref>. There are two results because depending on the zeros of the transfer function from u to z in (<ref>), the matrix A_r may have no unstable poles. As a consequence, Theorem\u00a0<ref> cannot be used and Theorem\u00a0<ref> must be evaluated instead.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Preliminary Results\n\n\nIn this section we provide lemmas necessary to the proof of our main results.\n\n \n\tConsider the  system (<ref>) and suppose the dimensions are such that (C_1B_2) \u2260 0 is a scalar.

Suppose the conditions of Theorem <ref> are satisfied when \u03f5=0 and X_0>0 is a solution to (<ref>). The dimension of X_0 is related to \u00c3_22 by dim(X_0) = dim(\u00c3_22)=1, so in this case X_0 is scalar. Our proof methodology will show that for any \u03f5 within the range 0 < \u03f5 < -Re[\u03bb_n-2], if there exists a left eigenvector of A_r such that X_\u03f5=0, then X_0=0 must also be true, which contradicts our initial assumption. To that end, let \u03b3 = -Re[\u03bb_n-2] and suppose there exists an \u03f5 within the range 0 < \u03f5 < \u03b3 such that X=0. Also, let y_1 be a left eigenvector of A_r such that \n\t\n    y_1^TA_r = (\u03bc + \u03f5) y_1^T,\n\n\twhere A_r is defined in (<ref>) and \u03bc=\u03bb_n is the anti-stable eigenvalue of A_q.\n\t\n\tAccording to Lemma\u00a0<ref>, if X=0, then either\n\t\n    (C_1B_1B_2^T-C_1B_2B_1^T)/(C_1B_2)^2y_1   = 0, \n    or        B_2^Ty_1   = 0.\n\n\t\n\tWe now consider each of these conditions separately:\n\t\n\tCase 1, (<ref>) is satisfied: \n\t\n\n\n\tIn this case,\n\t\n    (C_1B_1B_2^T-C_1B_2B_1^T/(C_1B_2)^2)y_1 = w^Ty_1   = 0.\n\n\tSince we can easily check that the vector w is orthogonal to C_1, it follows that\n\t\n    C_1^T \u2208 ker(A_r^T).\n\t\n\tMoreover, we have distinct eigenvalues, therefore C_1 is also a basis for ker(A_r^T). Since w is orthogonal to the basis of ker(A_r^T), this must mean w\u2208 range(A_r). Thus, we can describe w using a linear combination of basis vectors for range(A_r), to give\n\t\n    w = \u03b2_1 x_1 + \u03b2_2 x_2 + \u22ef + \u03b2_n-1x_n-1,\n\n\twhere \u03b2_1,\u22ef,\u03b2_n-1\u2208\u211d and x_1,\u22ef,x_n-1 are eigenvectors of A_r corresponding to the n-1 non-zero eigenvalues.\n\t\n\tUsing this form of w, we can restate (<ref>) as\n\t\n    w^Ty_1   = 0 \n    y_1^Tw   = 0 \n    \u03b2_1 y_1^Tx_1 + \u22ef + \u03b2_n-1y_1^Tx_n-1   = 0.\n\n\tAccording to Lemma\u00a0<ref>, every term after \u03b2_1 y_1^Tx_1 will be equal to zero. Therefore (<ref>) is reduced to\n\t\n    \u03b2_1 y_1^Tx_1 = 0.\n\n\tEquation (<ref>) tells us that Condition (<ref>) holds if either \u03b2_1=0 or y_1^Tx_1 = 0.\n\t\n\tSince we only have simple eigenvalues, it follows from Lemma\u00a0<ref> that y_1^Tx_1 = 0 cannot occur. Therefore, we now consider \u03b2_1=0. \n\t\n\tIf we substitute \u03b2_1=0 back into (<ref>), the first term is eliminated and we are left with\n\t\n    w = \u03b2_2 x_2 + \u22ef + \u03b2_n-1x_n-1.\n\n\tWe know from Lemma\u00a0<ref> that A_q and A_r will have the same right-eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue. Therefore, each vector x_i is an eigenvector of A_q and the following holds:\n\t\n    A_q x_i = \u03bb_i x_i,\n\n\tfor i = 1,2,\u22ef, n-2,n.\n\tAlso, for the eigenvalue \u03bc=\u03bb_n in (<ref>), there will be a left-eigenvector of A_q, y_0, that satisfies\n\t\n    y_0^T A_q = \u03bcy_0^T.\n\n\tNow, consider \n\t\n    w^Ty_0 = \u03b2_2 x_2^Ty_0 + \u22ef + \u03b2_n-1x_n-1y_0.\n\n\tWe can apply Lemma\u00a0<ref> to show that each term in this sum is orthogonal and therefore zero.

This contradicts our initial assumption that X_0>0.\n\t\n\n\n\tCase 2, (<ref>) is satisfied: \n\t\n\n\n\tIn this case, let y_1 be a left eigenvector of A_r such that \n\t\n    y_1^TA_r = (\u03bc + \u03f5) y_1^T\n and\n\t\n    B_2^Ty_1   = 0.\n\n\tWe know (A,B_2) is controllable by assumption. Since is (A,B_2) controllable, it follows immediately that (A + \u03f5I , B_2) is also controllable. Using this knowledge, we will make a manipulation on A_r to show that it is also controllable. To that end, remember A_r = QA + \u03f5Q, Q= I - B_2(C_1B_2)^-1C_2, and C_1B_2 is a scalar. Let k = -C_1(A+\u03f5I)/C_1B_2 and consider the following manipulation:\n\t\n    A_r = Q(A + \u03f5I)\n    \t\n    \t\t   = (A+\u03f5I) - (B_2C_1/C_1B_2)(A+\u03f5I) \n       = A + \u03f5I + B_2K.\n\n\tThus, we can conclude from (<ref>) that (A_r, B_2) is also controllable. An immediate consequence of (A_r, B_2) being controllable is  that there can be no left eigenvector of A_r that is orthogonal to B_2. Therefore, (<ref>) can never be satisfied and we have a contradiction. \n\t\n\n\n\tWe have shown that both cases lead to a contradiction. \n\u25aa\n\n\n\n\nProof of Theorem <ref>: \n\tFor \u03f5 within the range 0 < \u03f5 < \u03b3, where \u03b3 = -Re[\u03bb_n-1], the closed-loop system is SNI follows directly from Theorem\u00a0<ref>. For -Re[\u03bb_n-2] < \u03f5 < -Re[\u03bb_n-2], the matrix A_q will have attained an unstable eigenvalue. Consequently, X has dimension one. Therefore, if the system satisfies the conditions of Theorem <ref> for -Re[\u03bb_n-2] < \u03f5 < -Re[\u03bb_n-2], then the system will remain SNI for all \u03f5 within the range 0< \u03f5 < -Re[\u03bb_n-2] follows directly from Theorem <ref>. \n\u25aa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE\n \n\n\nIn this section we provide an illustrative example that illustrates Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\n \n\n\n\nConsider an uncertain system\n\n\n    A    = [ -1  0 -1;  1  0 -1; -1  2  1 ],    \n    \tB_1    = [ 1; 1; 1 ],    \n    \tB_2    = [ 0; 1; 1 ], \n    \n    \tC_1    = [ 1 1 0 ],     D    = 0.\n\nthat satisfies assumptions A1-A2.

With \u03f5=1.6458, the matrix A_r = QA+\u03f5Q has the form\n\n    A_r    = [  0.6458       0      -1; -0.6458       0       1; -2.6458  0.3542  4.6458 ],\n\nwith \u03c3(A_r) = {0 ,    5.2946 } and the 0 eigenvalue has multiplicity two. At exactly \u03f5=1.6458, the matrix X is undergoing a dimension change and cannot be evaluated. Therefore, we analyse X as we approach \u03f5=1.6458 from the positive direction on the real axis; i.e., we consider \u03f5^+ : \u03f5\u2192 1.6458^+.\n\nWe can reform X_\u03f5^+ for our perturbed system as \t\n    X_\u03f5^+   = [ -5.5431  0.2815;  0.2815  0.2477 ].\n\nIt is easily verified that X_\u03f5^+ is dimension 2 and no longer positive definite, with a negative eigenvalue at -5.5568. We no longer satisfy the conditions of Theorem <ref> and cannot guaranteed the SNI property.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have studied the maximum prescribed degree of stability that can be achieved by SISO closed-loop systems formed using SNI state feedback. These results show that in the cases considered, the achievable degree of stability for the closed-loop system is related to the zeros of the transfer of the nominal plant from the control input to the disturbance output. These results were given under a number of assumptions and future research will be directed towards relaxing these assumptions and extending the results to MIMO systems. \n\n-12cm   \n                                  \n                                  \n                                  \n                                  \n                                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIEEEtran\n\n"}
