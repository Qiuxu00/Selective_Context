We investigate whether W^1,1 solutions are necessarily W^1,2_, which would make the theories by De Giorgi-Nash and Schauder applicable.\nWe answer this question positively for a suitable class of functionals. This is an extension of Weyl's classical lemma for the Laplace equation to a wider class of equations under stronger regularity assumptions. Conversely, using convex integration, we show that outside this class of functionals, there exist W^1,1 solutions of locally infinite energy to scalar Euler-Lagrange equations. In addition, we prove an intermediate result which permits the regularity of a W^1,1 solution to be improved to W^1,2_ under suitable assumptions on the functional and solution.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\nLet f \u2208 C^2(^n) be uniformly convex and \u03a9\u2282^n any bounded Lipschitz domain. The equation\n\n    EL (Df(Du)) = 0  in \u03a9\n\nis the Euler-Lagrange equation of the energy functional \u2130_f  W^1,2(\u03a9) \u2192 defined by\n\n    \u2130_f(u) \u222b_\u03a9 f(Du)   dx.\n\nThis is a standard model in the Calculus of Variations. The classical regularity theory was obtained in the fundamental works by E. De Giorgi in <cit.> and J. Nash in <cit.>.\nIn this paper, we devote our attention to distributional solutions of (<ref>) belonging to W^1,1(\u03a9). \nWe pursue the question whether such solutions are of locally finite energy which would make the theories of De Giorgi-Nash <cit.> and Schauder <cit.> applicable.\nIn other words, we study functions u \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9) for which we have\n\n    \u222b_\u03a9 Df(Du) \u00b7 D\u03c6  dx = 0,   \u2200\u03c6\u2208 C_0^\u221e(\u03a9).\n\nNotice that if Df is of linear growth, the expression above is well-defined.\nOur study is focused on existence and non-existence of distributional solutions u \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9) \u2216 W^1,2_(\u03a9). Since the energy \u2130_f of such solutions is infinite, we sometimes call such solutions non-energetic. For the Laplace equation it is well-known from Weyl's lemma that any distributional solution to \n\n    \u0394 u = 0  in \u03a9\n\nis smooth, proving that no non-energetic solutions exist for the Laplace equation.\nThe following result due to V. \u0160ver\u00e1k and X. Yan <cit.> treats the vectorial version of (<ref>): \n[<cit.>]\nThere exists f ^3 \u00d7 3\u2192 smooth, uniformly convex such that |D^2 f| \u2264 c in ^3 \u00d7 3 and the equation\n\n    (Df(Du)) = 0\n\nadmits a solution in W^1,p\u2216 W^1,2 (1 < p < 2). This in particular proves non-uniqueness of solutions in W^1,p.\n\n\nThe existence and non-existence of non-energetic solutions has already been extensively studied for the p-Laplace equation as well as the linear equation\n\n    (A(x) \u00b7 Du) = 0  in \u03a9\n\nwhere \u03bb I \u2264 A(x) \u2264\u039b I and A is measurable. We give a swift outline of the situation for (<ref>). For the standard regularity theory we refer to the fundamental works by E. De Giorgi and J. Nash <cit.> (see also <cit.>). Subsequently, J. Serrin <cit.> provided an example of a distributional solution to (<ref>) not belonging to L^\u221e_.\nThe solutions constructed by J. Serrin belong to W^1,p for all 1 < p < 2 showing that u \u2208 W^1,2 is a crucial assumption in the theory by De Giorgi-Nash.\nFollowing this striking achievement, J. Serrin <cit.> conjectured that if A is H\u00f6lder continuous, then any W^1,1 solution to (<ref>) belongs to W^1,2_loc. The conjecture was confirmed by R. Hager and J. Ross <cit.> for W^1,p solutions with 1 < p < 2 and by H. Brezis <cit.> for W^1,1 solutions. The results by H. Brezis are more general than what the conjecture requires, see <cit.>. For further results regarding very weak solutions to (<ref>), we refer to <cit.>. We also give a brief description of the situation for the p-Laplace equation. For the standard regularity theory we refer to <cit.>.\nIn <cit.>, T. Iwaniec and C. Sbordone conjectured that any W^1,r solution with r > max{1, p-1 } to the p-Laplace equation is W^1,p_ and hence classical in the interior of the domain. The conjecture was confirmed in the case when p - \u03b4 < r < p for some \u03b4 > 0 depending on n and p by T. Iwaniec and C. Sbordone <cit.>. \nRecently, in <cit.>, the conjecture was proved to be false in full generality.\n\n \n\nThe main goal of this paper is to establish an optimal condition (see (<ref>) below) under which no non-energetic solutions exist. \nOur first main result is the following, which treats more general problems than (<ref>). It states that if the Euler-Lagrange equation resembles that of a convex quadratic form, then a Weyl-type result holds.\n\n Let n \u2265 1 and \u03a9\u2282^n be a Lipschitz domain. Let f \u2208 C^1(^n) be a function so that there exist 0 \u2264\u03b3 < 1, A \u2208^n \u00d7 n an elliptic matrix with ellipticity constants m and M as well as a constant K > 0 for which we have\n \n    N\n     |Df(x) - Ax| \u2264 K(1 + |x|^\u03b3),   \u2200 x \u2208^n.\n\nLet h \u2208 L^p(\u03a9) for some 1 < p < n and u \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9) be a distributional solution of (Df(Du)) = h. Then u \u2208 W^1,p^\u22c6_(\u03a9) (where p^\u22c6np/n-p) with \n \n    u _W^1, p^\u22c6(\u03a9^')\u2264 C ( 1 +  u _W^1, 1(\u03a9) +  h _L^p(\u03a9))   for all \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9\n\n for some constant C depending only on \u03a9, \u03a9^', n, p, \u03b3, m, M and K.\n\nNote that, although we require A to be elliptic, we do not require f to be convex.\nTheorem\u00a0<ref> implies that if u \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9) is a distributional solution of (<ref>) and f satisfies (<ref>), then u \u2208 W^1,p_(\u03a9) for all 1 < p < \u221e. \n \n\nOur second main result demonstrates that if (<ref>) is not satisfied, e.g. if (<ref>) is satisfied with A elliptic but \u03b3 = 1, then, one can in general not improve the regularity from W^1,1 to W^1,2_ for solutions to (<ref>).\n\nLet \u03a9\u2282^2 be a Lipschitz domain and 0 < \u03bb < \u039b < \u221e be arbitrary. Then there is a smooth and uniformly convex function f \u2208 C^\u221e(^2) with \u03bb I \u2264 D^2f(x) \u2264\u039b I, \u2200 x \u2208^2 such that for any p < p_\u03bb, \u039b2 \u221a(\u039b)/\u221a(\u03bb) + \u221a(\u039b) and any \u03b1\u2208 (0,1), (<ref>) admits infinitely many solutions u \u2208 W^1,p(\u03a9) \u2229 C^\u03b1(\u03a9) with identical affine boundary datum and \n\n    \u222b_B |Du|^2   dx = + \u221e   for any ball  B \u2282\u03a9.\n\n\nWe observe that p_\u03bb, \u039b\u2192 2 as \u039b\u2192\u221e for fixed \u03bb. \nMoreover, we observe that the exponent p_\u03bb, \u039b coincides with the lower critical exponent for 2D linear elliptic equations, see the works by F. Leonetti and V. Nesi <cit.>, K. Astala <cit.> and S. Petermichl and A. Volberg <cit.> (see also <cit.> and <cit.>). \n\nAs a byproduct, the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref> shows that Theorem\u00a0<ref> is optimal. Indeed, consider the case n = 2 and assume that f ^2 \u2192 satisfies (<ref>). Then\n\n    lim_a \u2192 - \u221e\u2202_1 f(a,b)/a = lim_a \u2192 + \u221e\u2202_1 f(a,b)/a  \u2200 b \u2208  and  lim_b \u2192 - \u221e\u2202_2 f(a,b)/b = lim_b \u2192 + \u221e\u2202_2 f(a,b)/b  \u2200 a \u2208.\n\nThe functions considered in the proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref> are such that \n\n    lim_a \u2192 + \u221e\u2202_1 f(a,b)/a = \u03bb  and  lim_a \u2192 - \u221e\u2202_1 f(a,b)/a = \u039b  \u2200 b \u2208\n\nand satisfy (<ref>) with \u03b3 = 1 and some elliptic matrix A.\nThis demonstrates that the assumptions of Theorem\u00a0<ref> cannot be relaxed.\n\nOur proof of Theorem\u00a0<ref> uses the convex integration method invented by S. M\u00fcller and V. \u0160ver\u00e1k <cit.> and ever since used to attack a wide range of problems related to wild solutions of PDE's, compare for instance <cit.>. Staircase laminates, which were introduced by D. Faraco in <cit.> (and subsequently further developed and used in e.g. <cit.>) are a central part of the proof. Such techniques were recently used in <cit.> to build very weak solutions to the p-Laplace equation. \n\nFinally, our last main result reveals that under a pinching condition on f and one-sided bounds on solutions u to (<ref>), regularity can be improved from W^1,1 to W^1,2_.\n\n Let n \u2265 1 and \u03a9\u2282^n be a Lipschitz domain. Let f \u2208 C^2(^n) be a convex function so that there exist 0 < \u03bb < \u039b < \u221e for which we have \u03bb I \u2264 D^2f(x) \u2264\u039b I for all x \u2208^n. Assume that the following pinching condition \n \n    \u039b^2(1 - n^-1) < \u03bb^2\n\n holds. Let u \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9) be a distributional solution of (Df(Du)) = h where h \u2208 L^1(\u03a9). Assume that there exist \u03c3_i \u2208{ -1 , 1} and L_i \u2208 such that\n \n    \u03c3_i \u2202_i u \u2265 L_i   a.e. in \u03a9 for all i = 1, \u2026, n.\n\n Then u \u2208 W^1,2_(\u03a9) with\n \n    u _W^1,2(\u03a9^')\u2264 C (  Du _L^1(\u03a9; ^n) +  h _L^1(\u03a9)) ( u _L^1(\u03a9) +  (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2)   for all \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9\n\n for some constant C depending only on \u03a9, \u03a9^', n, \u039b and \u03bb.\n\nA comparable result for the p-Laplace equation is already available. We refer the reader to <cit.>, the proof of which is close to that of Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\nTheorem\u00a0<ref> leaves open whether the pinching condition (<ref>) is necessary.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Plan of the paper\n\nIn Section\u00a0<ref>, we introduce some notation and preliminary results. We prove Theorem\u00a0<ref> in Section <ref>. In the next section we prove Theorem\u00a0<ref>. The remainder of the paper is dedicated to proving Theorem\u00a0<ref>. In Section\u00a0<ref> we do the necessary geometric construction. In Section\u00a0<ref>, we give a detailed description of our convex integration scheme. The two last sections prove Theorem\u00a0<ref>. \n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe author was supported by the SNSF Grant 182565 and by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and lnnovation (SERI) under contract number MB22.00034.\nThe author thanks Riccardo Tione and Maria Colombo for suggesting to investigate the topic of very weak solutions to Euler-Lagrange equations. Their suggestions have been of great value. This paper is an outcome of improvements made to results proved in the master thesis of the author carried out at EPFL in fall 2021 <cit.>. The advice from Xavier Fern\u00e1ndez-Real regarding Theorem\u00a0<ref> is gratefully acknowledged.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 NOTATION AND PRELIMINAIRES\n\n\nIn this section, we introduce some notation and results from classical convex integration, see <cit.>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Notation\n\nThroughout this paper, \u03a9\u2282^n denotes any bounded Lipschitz domain in ^n. We will use | \u00b7 | to denote the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure in ^n. We also use this notation to denote the Euclidian norm i.e.\n\n    |x| = |(x_1, \u2026, x_n)| = ( \u2211_i = 1^n x_i^2 )^1/2,    x \u2208^n.\n\nFor any map u \u03a9\u2192^m the j-th component is denoted by u^j.\nA continuous Lipschitz map u \u03a9\u2192^m will be called piecewise affine if there is a collection \u2131 of open convex mutually disjoint sets covering \u03a9 up to a set of Lebesgue measure 0 such that for all U \u2208\u2131, u |_U is affine.\nLet n,m \u2265 2. The set of real-valued matrices with n rows and m columns is denoted by ^n \u00d7 m. \nA matrix A \u2208^n \u00d7 n is said to be elliptic if there exists constants 0 < m \u2264 M such that mI \u2264 A \u2264 MI i.e.\n\n    m |x|^2 \u2264 Ax \u00b7 x \u2264 M |x|^2   \u2200 x \u2208^n.\n\nThe constants m and M are called the ellipticity constants of A.\nThe set of real-valued symmetric matrices with n rows and n columns is denoted by ^n \u00d7 n_. \nWe say that two matrices A, B \u2208^n \u00d7 m are rank-one connected if A - B\u2264 1. \nIf A and B are rank-one connected, the segment \n\n    [A,B] { tA + (1 - t)B : t \u2208 [0,1] }\n\nis called a rank-one segment. A function is called rank-one convex if it is convex along any rank-one segment.\nWe let \u03c1\u2208 C^\u221e_0(^n) be a function such that supp(\u03c1) \u2282 B_1 and \u222b_B_1\u03c1  dx = 1. We define \u03c1_\u2208 C^\u221e_0(^n) as\n\n    \u03c1_(x) 1/^n\u03c1( x/).\n\nFor any u \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9), we denote its convolution with \u03c1_ as u_ u \u2217\u03c1_. Note that u_ is only well-defined in { x \u2208\u03a9: x\u03a9^c > }. To overcome this restriction in the case where u has affine boundary datum, we extend u in an affine manner to ^n. Then u_ is well-defined on the whole \u03a9. This is also true for (Du)_. Finally, given x_1, \u2026, x_N, we define\n\n    \u2211_k = i^j x_k  0   and  \u220f_k = i^j x_k  1   whenever  j < i.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results from Lipschitz convex integration\n\nIn this subsection we introduce the building blocks of the convex integration scheme invented by M\u00fcller and \u0160ver\u00e1k and some extensions due to Astala, Faraco and Sz\u00e9kelyhidi. The content of this subsection comes from <cit.>.\n\n\nThe barycenter of a probability measure \u03bd on ^n \u00d7 m is \u03bd = \u222b_^n \u00d7 m X   d\u03bd(X) \u2208^n \u00d7 m.\n\n\n\nA probability measure on ^n \u00d7 m \u03bd is a laminate if f(\u03bd) \u2264\u222b_^n \u00d7 m f(X)   d\u03bd(X) for all f ^n \u00d7 m\u2192 rank-one convex.\n\n\n\nAssume \u03bd = \u2211_j = 1^r \u03bb_j\u03b4_A_j with A_j \u2260 A_k whenever j \u2260 k. The measure \u03bd^' is said to be obtained from \u03bd by an elementary splitting if for some j and some \u03bb\u2208 [0,1], there exists a rank-one segment [B_1, B_2] containing A_j with (1 - s)B_1 + sB_2 = A_j such that\n\n    \u03bd^' = \u03bd + \u03bb\u03bb_j ( (1 - s)\u03b4_B_1 + s\u03b4_B_2 - \u03b4_A_j).\n\n\nIt follows from the definition of laminates that any probability measure that is obtained by an elementary splitting of a lamiate is also a laminate. This justifies the notion of laminates of finite order:\n\n\n We say that a laminate \u03bd is a laminate of finite order if there exists probability measures \u03bd_1, \u2026, \u03bd_m such that\n \u03bd_1 = \u03b4_A for some A, \u03bd_m = \u03bd and for each j = 1, \u2026, m-1, \u03bd_j+1 can be obtained from \u03bd_j by an elementary splitting.\n\n\n\nLet \u03bd = \u2211_j = 1^r \u03bb_j \u03b4_A_j (with A_j \u2208^n \u00d7 m for all j and A_j \u2260 A_k whenever j \u2260 k) be a laminate of finite order and let A = \u03bd be the barycenter of \u03bd. Then for any \u03b1\u2208 (0,1), any > 0, any b \u2208^m and any 0 < \u03b4 < 1/2min{ |A_i - A_j| : i \u2260 j } there is a piecewise affine mapping u \u03a9\u2192^m such that\n\n \n  * u - (Ax + b) _C^\u03b1(\u03a9; ^m) <;\n \n  * u = Ax + b on \u2202\u03a9;\n \n  * |{ x \u2208\u03a9 : |Du(x) - A_j| < \u03b4}| = \u03bb_j |\u03a9| for all j = 1, \u2026, r.\n\nIf m = n and all the matrices A_j \u2208^n \u00d7 n_, then the piecewise affine mapping u can be selected so that there exists g \u2208 W^2, \u221e(\u03a9) for which we have u = Dg.\n\n\n\nThe last sentence in the previous lemma is particularly important in our construction. Indeed, we will use the following which is a consequence of the lemma above: let \u03bd = \u2211_j = 1^r \u03bb_j \u03b4_A_j be a laminate of finite order with A_j \u2208^n \u00d7 n_ for all j = 1, \u2026, r, A_i \u2260 A_j whenever i \u2260 j and A = \u03bd. In addition, for all j = 1, \u2026, r, let U_j \u2282^n \u00d7 n_ be an open neighbourhood of A_j in ^n \u00d7 n_. Then for any \u03b1\u2208 (0,1), any > 0 and any b \u2208^n, there exists a piecewise affine mapping u \u03a9\u2192^n such that\n\n \n  * u - (Ax + b) _C^\u03b1(\u03a9; ^n) <;\n \n  * u = Ax + b on \u2202\u03a9;\n \n  * |{ x \u2208\u03a9 : Du(x) \u2208 U_j }| = \u03bb_j |\u03a9| for all j = 1, \u2026, r.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PROOF OF THEOREM\u00a0<REF>\n\nIn this section, we prove Theorem\u00a0<ref>. We first need a preliminary lemma. We recall that for any p \u2208 [1,n), we define p^\u22c6 as p^\u22c6 = np/n - p.\n\n Let 1 < p < n, 1 < q < \u221e and A \u2208^n \u00d7 n be an elliptic matrix with ellipticity constants m and M. If u \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9) is a distributional solution of\n \n    (A Du) = h +  G\n\n for some h \u2208 L^p(\u03a9) and G \u2208 L^q(\u03a9; ^n). Then u \u2208 W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)_(\u03a9) with \n \n    u _W^1, p^\u22c6(\u03a9^')\u2264 C (  u _W^1, 1(\u03a9) +  h _L^p(\u03a9) +  G _L^q(\u03a9; ^n) )   for all \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9\n\n for some constant C depending only on \u03a9, \u03a9^', n, p, q, m and M.\n Moreover, letting m and M be real numbers such that m I \u2264 A \u2264 M I, then for any \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9 there exists C depending only on \u03a9, \u03a9^', n, p, m and M such that\n \n    u _W^1, p^\u22c6(\u03a9^')\u2264 C (  u _W^1, 1(\u03a9) +  h _L^p(\u03a9) +  G _L^q(\u03a9; ^n) )\n \n\n\n Step 1: Assume that A is the identity matrix. Then u solves \u0394 u = h +  G. Let B \u2282\u03a9 be an arbitrary ball. By <cit.> and <cit.>, there exists u_B \u2208 W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)(B) solving \u0394 u_B = h +  G on B with \n\n    u_B _W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)(B)\u2264 c ( h _L^p(B) +  G _L^q(B; ^n))\n\n for some c depending only on B, n, p and q.\n Hence u - u_B is harmonic on B. Thus u \u2208 W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)_(B). \n By Cald\u00e9ron-Zygmund estimates, for any B^'\u22d0 B \u2282\u03a9\n \n    u - u_B _W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)(B^')\u2264 c^' u - u_B _W^1, 1(B).\n\n for some c^' depending only on B, B^', n, p and q.\n Therefore,\n  \n    u _W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)(B^')   \u2264 u - u_B _W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)(B^') +  u_B _W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)(B^')\n    (<ref>)   \u2264 c^' u - u_B _W^1, 1(B) +  u_B _W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)(B^')\n       \u2264 2 c^' (  u _W^1, 1(B) +  u_B _W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)(B) ) \n    (<ref>)   \u2264 2 c c^' ( u _W^1, 1(B) +  h _L^p(B) +  G _L^q(B; ^n) ).\n\n Since u \u2208 W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)_(B) for any ball B \u2282\u03a9, we conclude that u \u2208 W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)_(\u03a9). In virtue of (<ref>), for any \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9, \n\n    u _W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)(\u03a9^')\u2264 C  ( u _W^1, 1(\u03a9) +  h _L^p(\u03a9) +  G _L^q(\u03a9; ^n) )\n\nfor some constant C depending only on \u03a9, \u03a9^', n, p and q.\n \n\n Step 2: Let us now assume that A is an arbitrary symmetric positive definite matrix. Then there exists an invertible matrix R \u2208^n \u00d7 n such that A = R^T I R. \n Let R^-T\u03a9{ R^-T x : x \u2208\u03a9} and define v \u2208 W^1,1(R^-T\u03a9) as\n \n    v(x)  u(R^T x).\n\n Then v solves \u0394 v = h\u0303 + G where h\u0303\u2208 L^p(R^-T\u03a9) and G\u2208 L^q(R^-T\u03a9; ^n) are defined as\n \n    h\u0303(x)  h(R^T x)   and  G(x)  R^-T G(R^T x).\n\n By Step 1, v \u2208 W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)_(R^-T\u03a9). We conclude that u \u2208 W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)_(\u03a9).

Let A_ be the symmetric part of A is defined as A_ = 1/2(A + A^T). Observe that\n \n    (A_ Du) =  (A Du) = h +  G.\n\n By Step 2, u \u2208 W^1, min(p^\u22c6, q)_(\u03a9) and (<ref>) holds. This ends the proof of Lemma\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\nWe can now prove Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\n\nWe begin with the case when 0 < \u03b3 < 1. We find that\n\n    (A Du) =  (A Du - Df(Du)_=:  G ) +  (Df(Du)) =   G  + h.\n\nSince \n\n    | G | \u2264 |A Du - Df(Du)| \u2264 K(1 + |Du|^\u03b3),\n\nwe find that G  \u2208 L^1\u03b3(\u03a9; ^n) with\n\n    G _L^1\u03b3(\u03a9; ^n)\u2264 c_K,\u03b3 (1 +  Du _L^1(\u03a9; ^n))\n\nfor some constant c_K,\u03b3 depending only on K and \u03b3.\nTherefore by Lemma\u00a0<ref>, u \u2208 W^1, min(1\u03b3, p^\u22c6)_(\u03a9). Due to (<ref>), for any \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9, there exists a constant c depending only \u03a9, \u03a9^', n, p, m, M and \u03b3 such that\n\n    u _W^1, min(1\u03b3, p^\u22c6)(\u03a9^')   \u2264 c ( u _W^1, 1(\u03a9) +  h _L^p(\u03a9) +  G _L^1\u03b3(\u03a9; ^n) ) \n       \u2264 c ( u _W^1, 1(\u03a9) +  h _L^p(\u03a9) + c_K,\u03b3 (1 +  Du _L^1(\u03a9; ^n)) ) \n       \u2264 2 c c_K,\u03b3 (1 +  u _W^1, 1(\u03a9) +  h _L^p(\u03a9)).\n\nThus, by (<ref>), G \u2208 L^1\u03b3min(1\u03b3, p^\u22c6)_(\u03a9; ^n). By applying the same argument as above, u \u2208 W^1, min(1\u03b3^2, p^\u22c6)_(\u03a9) with\n\n    u _W^1, min(1\u03b3^2, p^\u22c6)(\u03a9^')\u2264 c^' (1 +  u _W^1, 1(\u03a9) +  h _L^p(\u03a9))    for all \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9\n\nfor some constant c^' depending only on \u03a9, \u03a9^', n, p, \u03b3, m, M and K.\nBy a bootstrapping argument on a finite increasing sequence of compacts between \u03a9^' and \u03a9, u \u2208 W^1, p^\u22c6_(\u03a9) with  \n\n    u _W^1, p^\u22c6(\u03a9^')\u2264 C (1 +  u _W^1, 1(\u03a9) +  h _L^p(\u03a9))     for all \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9\n\nfor some constant C depending only on \u03a9, \u03a9^', n, p, \u03b3, m, M and K.\nIf \u03b3 = 0, then the argument above gives that G \u2208 L^\u221e(\u03a9; ^n). Thus u \u2208 W^1, p^\u22c6_(\u03a9; ^n) and (<ref>) holds. This finishes the proof.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PROOF OF THEOREM\u00a0<REF>\n\nIn this section, we shall prove Theorem\u00a0<ref>. First, however, we need a preliminary lemma. We recall the notation w_ w \u2217\u03c1_ from Subsection\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n Let n \u2265 1, \u03a9\u2282^n and u \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9). Assume that for all i = 1, \u2026, n, there exist \u03c3_i \u2208{ -1, 1} and L_i \u2208 such that\n \n    \u03c3_i \u2202_i u \u2265 L_i  a.e. on \u03a9.\n\n Then for any \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9 and < 1/2\u03a9^'\u03a9^c\n \n    (|Du|)_\u2264 n^12 |Du_| + 2 n^12 (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2 a.e. on \u03a9^'.\n\n\n\n\n Step 1:  Fix some arbitrary \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9 and < 1/2\u03a9^'\u03a9^c. We start by assuming that all derivatives \u2202_i u preserve their sign over \u03a9. By this, we mean that there exists \u03c3_i \u2208{ -1, 1} for all i= 1, \u2026, n so that \u2202_i u = \u03c3_i |\u2202_i u|. Then, for all x \u2208\u03a9^'\n \n    (|Du|)_(x)    = \u222b_\u03a9( \u2211_i = 1^n |\u2202_i u|^2 )^12 (x-y) \u03c1_(y)   dy \n       \u2264\u222b_\u03a9\u2211_i = 1^n |\u2202_i u (x-y)| \u03c1_(y)   dy \n       = \u2211_i = 1^n | \u222b_\u03a9\u2202_i u(x-y) \u03c1_(y)   dy | \n       \u2264 n^12( \u2211_i = 1^n| \u222b_\u03a9\u2202_i u(x-y) \u03c1_(y)   dy |^2 )^12 = n^12 |Du_|(x).\n\n  Step 2: \n  Once again, fix some arbitrary \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9 and < 1/2\u03a9^'\u03a9^c.\n  Now we assume that there are \u03c3_i \u2208{ -1, 1 } and L_i \u2208 such that \u03c3_i \u2202_i u \u2265 L_i a.e. on \u03a9. Define a new function as \u0169(x)  u(x) - \u2211_i = 1^n\u03c3_i L_i x_i. The function \u0169 satisfies the conditions of Step 1 and therefore (|D\u0169|)_\u2264 n^12 |D\u0169_| a.e. on \u03a9^'. We conclude that\n  \n    (|Du|)_(x)    \u2264 (|D\u0169|)_(x) +  (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2\n       \u2264 n^12 |D\u0169_|(x) +  (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2\n       \u2264 n^12 |Du_|(x) + 2 n^12 (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2\n\n  for all x \u2208\u03a9^'.\n\n\nWe can now prove Theorem\u00a0<ref>. The proof is close to the proof of <cit.>.\n\n Step 1:  In this first step, we assume that n(\u039b^2 - 2\u03bb + 1) < 1. The reason for this assumption is not clear at this point but will become clear in the proof. Moreover, without loss of generality, we can assume that \u03bb < \u039b. Indeed, if \u03bb = \u039b, then there is a \u03bb^' < \u039b such that n(\u039b^2 - 2\u03bb^' + 1) < 1 and \u03bb^' I \u2264 D^2 f(x) \u2264\u039b I still holds. Notice that, since we assume \u03bb < \u039b, we have \u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1 > \u039b^2 - 2 \u039b + 1 = (\u039b - 1)^2 \u2265 0. In addition, we may, without loss of generality, assume that Df(0) = 0.\n We have \n \n    \u222b_\u03a9 Df(Du) \u00b7 D \u03c6  dx = \u222b_\u03a9 h \u03c6  dx   \u2200\u03c6\u2208 C^\u221e_0(\u03a9).\n\n Let \u03a9^'\u22d0\u03a9^''\u22d0\u03a9^'''\u22d0\u03a9 with \u03a9^'\u03a9^c\u2264 2 \u03a9^'''\u03a9^c and let < \u03a9^'''\u03a9^c. We find that \n \n    \u222b_\u03a9^'' (Df(Du))_\u00b7 D \u03c6  dx = \u222b_\u03a9^'' h_\u03c6  dx   \u2200\u03c6\u2208 C^\u221e_0(\u03a9^'').\n\nLet \u03a8\u2208 C^\u221e_0(\u03a9^'') such that \u03a8 = 1 on \u03a9^' and D \u03a8_L^\u221e(\u03a9^''; ^n)\u2264 5 \u03a9^'\u03a9^''^c^-1. Then\n\n    \u222b_\u03a9^'' (Df(Du))_\u00b7 D(\u03a8 u_)   dx = \u222b_\u03a9^'' h_\u03a8 u_  dx.\n\n which leads to \n \n    \u222b_\u03a9^''((Df(Du))_\u00b7 Du_) \u03a8  dx = - \u222b_\u03a9^''((Df(Du))_\u00b7 D \u03a8) u_  dx + \u222b_\u03a9^'' h_\u03a8 u_  dx.\n\n The left-hand side in (<ref>) equals\n \n    \u222b_\u03a9^'' |Du_|^2 \u03a8  dx + \u222b_\u03a9^'' ((Df(Du))_ - Du_) \u00b7 Du_\u03a8  dx.\n\nObserve that\n \n    |Df(Du) - Du|^2    = |Df(Du)|^2 - 2 Df(Du) \u00b7 Du + |Du|^2 \n       = |Df(Du)|^2_\u2264\u039b^2 |Du|^2 - 2 (Df(Du) - Df(0)) \u00b7 (Du - 0)_\u2265\u03bb |Du|^2 + |Du|^2 \u2264 (\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1) |Du|^2\n\n and hence, by Lemma\u00a0<ref>, we have\n \n    |(Df(Du))_ - Du_|    \u2264 |Df(Du) - Du|_\u2264 (\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12(|Du|)_\n    (<ref>)   \u2264 n^12(\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12|Du_| + 2 n^12 (\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12 (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2.\n\n Therefore\n \n    | \u222b_\u03a9^'' ((Df(Du))_ - Du_) \u00b7 Du_\u03a8  dx |    \u2264 n^12(\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12\u222b_\u03a9^'' |Du_|^2 \u03a8  dx \n            + 2 n^12 (\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12 (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2\u222b_\u03a9^'' |Du_| \u03a8  dx.\n\n We observe that due to <cit.> and (<ref>) there exists a constant C = C(n, \u03a9, \u03a9^'\u03a9^c) such that\n \n    u_^'_L^\u221e(\u03a9^'')\u2264 C( u_^'_L^1(\u03a9^''') +  (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2)   \u2200^' < \u03a9^'''\u03a9^c.\n\n Then, by combining (<ref>) with (<ref>) and (<ref>), we find\n \n    ( 1 - n^12(\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12) \u222b_\u03a9^'' |Du_|^2 \u03a8  dx \n       \u2264 2 n^12 (\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12 (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2\u222b_\u03a9^'' |Du_| \u03a8  dx \n           + | \u222b_\u03a9^''((Df(Du))_\u00b7 D \u03a8) u_  dx | + | \u222b_\u03a9^'' h_\u03a8 u_  dx | \n       \u2264 2 n^12 (\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12 (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2 Du__L^1(\u03a9^''; ^2)\n            +  (Df(Du))__L^1(\u03a9^''; ^n) D \u03a8_L^\u221e(\u03a9^''; ^n) u__L^\u221e(\u03a9^'') +  h__L^1(\u03a9^'')\u03a8_L^\u221e(\u03a9^'') u__L^\u221e(\u03a9^'')\n    (<ref>)   \u2264 2 n^12 (\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12 (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2 Du__L^1(\u03a9^''; ^2)\n            + C \u039b Du _L^1(\u03a9; ^2) D \u03a8_L^\u221e(\u03a9^''; ^n) ( u__L^1(\u03a9^''') +  (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2 ) \n            + C  h _L^1(\u03a9) ( u__L^1(\u03a9^''') +  (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2 ) \n       \u2264 2 n^12 (\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12 (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2 Du _L^1(\u03a9; ^2)\n            + C ( \u039b Du _L^1(\u03a9; ^2) D \u03a8_L^\u221e(\u03a9^''; ^n) +  h _L^1(\u03a9))( u _L^1(\u03a9) +  (L_1, \u2026, L_n) _\u2113^2 ) =: C^'\n\n By lower semi-continuity,\n \n    \u222b_\u03a9^' |Du|^2   dx \u2264\u222b_\u03a9^'' |Du|^2 \u03a8  dx \u2264lim inf_\u2192 0\u222b_\u03a9^'' |Du_|^2 \u03a8  dx \u2264C^'1 - n^12(\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1)^12\n    < \u221e.\n\n Thus, u \u2208 W^1,2(\u03a9^'). Therefore, we conclude u \u2208 W^1,2_(\u03a9) and (<ref>) holds. \n\n Step 2: In this step, we drop the assumption that n (\u039b^2 - 2 \u03bb + 1) < 1. Since u solves the equation (Df(Du)) = h, u also solves the equation\n \n    ( 1/\u03b2Df(Du) ) = 1/\u03b2 h\n\n for all \u03b2 > 0.\n By direct computations, we find that the assumption that \u039b^2(1 - n^-1) < \u03bb^2 is sufficient to deduce that there exists a \u03b2 > 0 such that\n \n    n ( \u039b^2/\u03b2^2 - 2 \u03bb/\u03b2 + 1 ) < 1.\n\n We can then apply the arguments from Step 1 to the equation (<ref>) to conclude the proof. Since the choice of \u03b2 depends only on n, \u039b and \u03bb, (<ref>) still holds.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTIONS (PART 1 OF THE PROOF OF THEOREM\u00a0<REF>)\n\nIn this section, we do the necessary geometric constructions to be able to perform a convex integration scheme in the next section. In Subsection\u00a0<ref>, we show that (<ref>) is equivalent to a differential inclusion Dw \u2208 K_f. In this first subsection, we also select f depending on the values of \u03bb and \u039b. The set K_f is central in the geometric constructions. In Subsection\u00a0<ref>, we construct laminates of finite order partly supported on K_f. Although partly supported in the set K_f, it is not clear how to use these laminates together with Lemma\u00a0<ref> (see also Remark\u00a0<ref>) in order to construct a functioning convex integration scheme. Therefore, in Subsection\u00a0<ref>, we define interpolation maps. In Subsection\u00a0<ref>, we use these maps to modify the already constructed laminates so that they can be used to construct a functioning convex integration scheme.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Equation (<ref>) as a differential inclusion and choice of f\n\nThe aim of this subsection is to show that (<ref>) is equivalent to a differential inclusion. Define\n\n    K_f {[            a            b;   \u2202_2 f(a,b) - \u2202_1 f(a,b);              ]\n     :\n     a, b \u2208}.\n\nAssume u \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9) solves (<ref>). Define\n\n    J [  0  1; -1  0;    ].\n\nSince u solves (<ref>), JDf(Du) = 0. Due to this, there is \u0169\u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9) such that D \u0169 = JDf(Du). Define w  (u, \u0169) \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9; ^2). Then Dw(x) \u2208 K_f for a.e. x\u2208\u03a9. Now instead assume that for some w \u2208 W^1,1(\u03a9; ^2), we have Dw(x) \u2208 K_f for a.e. x \u2208\u03a9. Then (Df(Dw^1)) = Dw^2 = 0. Therefore, equation (<ref>) is equivalent to the differential inclusion Dw(x) \u2208 K_f for a.e. x \u2208\u03a9. Given 0 < \u03bb < \u039b as in Theorem\u00a0<ref>, let \u03c6\u2208 C^\u221e() by any function such that 0 < \u03bb < inf_a \u2208\u03c6^''(a) \u2264sup_a \u2208\u03c6^''(a) < \u039b,\n\n    lim_a \u2192 - \u221e\u03c6^'(a)/a = \u039b  and  lim_a \u2192 + \u221e\u03c6^'(a)/a = \u03bb.\n\nWe assume, without loss of generality, that \u03bb < 1 < \u039b.\nThen, choose f ^2 \u2192 to be f(a,b) = \u03c6(a) + b^22. The set K_f becomes\n\n    K_f =\n     {[        a        b;        b - \u03c6^'(a);          ]\n     :\n     a, b \u2208}\u2282^2 \u00d7 2_.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Construction and parametrisation of laminates of finite order\n\nIn this subsection, we build laminates of finite order depending on a set of parameters. The space of parameters is defined as \n\n    \ud835\udcab (1,2) \u00d7 (1,2) \u00d7 (-1,1) \u2282^3.\n\nWe define the maps a_0^+, a_0^-, b \ud835\udcab\u2192 as follows. Let P = (a_0^+, a_0^-, b) \u2208\ud835\udcab and define\n\n    a_0^+(P)  a_0^+,    a_0^-(P)  a_0^-,   and   b(P)  b.\n\nIn other words, a_0^+ is the projection from \ud835\udcab into the first coordinate, a_0^- is the projection from \ud835\udcab into the second coordinate and so on. Let 1 < r < 2 be a constant to be determined later (see Lemma\u00a0<ref>). For each P \u2208\ud835\udcab, we define the sequences { a_k^+(P) }_k = 1^\u221e and { a_k^-(P) }_k = 1^\u221e as\n\n    a_k^+(P)  a_0^+(P) + r^k   and   a_k^-(P)  a_0^-(P) + \u221a(\u03bb/r \u039b) r^k\n\nfor all k \u2265 1. The justification for this notation is that a_k^-(P) will always be used with a minus sign in front of it and a_k^+(P) without a minus sign. \nFor each P \u2208\ud835\udcab and each i \u2265 1, we define\n\n    A_i(P) [          a_i^+(P)              b(P);              b(P) - \u03c6^'(- a_i^-(P)) ].\n\nWe split the matrix A_i(P) along the rank-one direction\n\n    [ 0 0; 0 x ],\n\nx \u2208 with endpoints B_i(P) and C_i(P) where\n\n    B_i(P) [        a_i^+(P)            b(P);            b(P) - \u03c6^'(a_i^+(P)) ]  and  \n     C_i(P) [            a_i^+(P)                b(P);                b(P) - \u03c6^'(- a_i+1^-(P)) ].\n\nWe have A_i(P) = \u03bb_i^1(P) B_i(P) + (1 - \u03bb_i^1(P)) C_i(P) with\n\n    \u03bb_i^1(P) \u03c6^'(- a_i^-(P)) - \u03c6^'(- a_i+1^-(P))/\u03c6^'(a_i^+(P)) - \u03c6^'(- a_i+1^-(P)).\n\nThen we split the matrix C_i(P) along the rank-one direction\n\n    [ x^'   0;   0   0;     ],\n\nx^'\u2208 with endpoints D_i(P) and E_i(P) where\n\n    D_i(P) [        - a_i+1^-(P)                b(P);                b(P) - \u03c6^'(- a_i+1^-(P)) ]  and  \n     E_i(P) [          a_i+1^+(P)                b(P);                b(P) - \u03c6^'(- a_i+1^-(P)) ].\n\nWe have C_i(P) = \u03bb_i^2(P)/1 - \u03bb_i^1(P) D_i(P) + \u03bb_i^3(P)/1 - \u03bb_i^1(P) E_i(P) where \n\n    \u03bb_i^2(P) \u03c6^'(a_i^+(P)) - \u03c6^'(- a_i^-(P))/\u03c6^'(a_i^+(P)) - \u03c6^'(- a_i+1^-(P))a_i+1^+(P) - a_i^+(P)/a_i+1^-(P) + a_i+1^+(P)\n\nand\n\n    \u03bb_i^3(P) \u03c6^'(a_i^+(P)) - \u03c6^'(- a_i^-(P))/\u03c6^'(a_i^+(P)) - \u03c6^'(- a_i+1^-(P))a_i+1^-(P) + a_i^+(P)/a_i+1^-(P) + a_i+1^+(P).\n\nNotice that E_i(P) = A_i+1(P). By the construction above, we have\n\n    A_i(P) = \u03bb_i^1(P) B_i(P) + \u03bb_i^2(P) D_i(P) + \u03bb_i^3(P) E_i(P) = \u03bb_i^1(P) B_i(P) + \u03bb_i^2(P) D_i(P) + \u03bb_i^3(P) A_i+1(P)\n\nand \n\n    \u03bc^(i)(P) \u03bb_i^1(P) \u03b4_B_i(P) + \u03bb_i^2(P) \u03b4_D_i(P) + \u03bb_i^3(P) \u03b4_A_i+1(P)\n\nis a laminate of finite order with barycenter A_i(P). For an illustration of the matrices A_i(P), B_i(P), C_i(P), D_i(P) and E_i(P), we refer to Figure\u00a0<ref>. We end this subsection by a result about the behaviour of \u03bb_i^3 as i is large. We recall that p is a fixed arbitrary quantity in Theorem\u00a0<ref>, which satisfies \n\n    p < p_\u03bb, \u039b = 2 \u221a(\u039b)/\u221a(\u03bb) + \u221a(\u039b).\n\n\nFor any 0 < \u03b4 < 1/10(p_\u03bb, \u039b - p), there exists 1 < r < 2 and an integer I_0 such that for all i \u2265 I_0\n\n    1/r^2 < inf_P \u2208\ud835\udcab\u03bb_i^3(P) \u2264sup_P \u2208\ud835\udcab\u03bb_i^3(P) < 1/r^p + 2 \u03b4.\n\n\n\nBy standard calculations,\n\n    lim sup_i \u2192\u221esup_P \u2208\ud835\udcab\u03bb_i^3(P) \u2264( \u03bb\u221a(r) + \u221a(\u039b\u03bb)/\u03bb\u221a(r) + \u221a(\u039b\u03bb) r)^2 \u2264lim inf_i \u2192\u221einf_P \u2208\ud835\udcab\u03bb_i^3(P).\n\nThen we observe that \n\n    lim_r \u2192 1log_r [  ( \u03bb\u221a(r) + \u221a(\u039b\u03bb) r/\u03bb\u221a(r) + \u221a(\u039b\u03bb))^2 ] = 2 \u221a(\u039b)/\u221a(\u03bb) + \u221a(\u039b) = p_\u03bb, \u039b.\n\nThus, there exists an 1 < r < 2 such that \n\n    2 > log_r [  ( \u03bb\u221a(r) + \u221a(\u039b\u03bb) r/\u03bb\u221a(r) + \u221a(\u039b\u03bb))^2 ] > p + 2 \u03b4\n\nwhich implies\n\n    r^2 > ( \u03bb\u221a(r) + \u221a(\u039b\u03bb) r/\u03bb\u221a(r) + \u221a(\u039b\u03bb))^2 > r^p + 2 \u03b4.\n\nWe conclude (<ref>).\n\nFrom now on, we let \u03b4 be a fixed quantity satisfying 0 < \u03b4 < 1/10(p_\u03bb, \u039b - p). The quantities r and I_0 denote those given by the above lemma. In addition, we let C_r,p\u2265 0 denote a constant for which we have\n\n    j r^-p(j - 1)\u2264 C_r,p  \u2200 j \u2265 1.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Definition and properties of interpolation maps\n\nThe goal of this subsection is to define interpolation maps and prove useful properties of these maps. For any i \u2265 1, t \u2208 (0,1), we define \u03a6_i,t^1, \u03a6_i,t^2 \ud835\udcab\u2192^2 \u00d7 2_sym as\n\n    \u03a6_i,t^1(P) = tB_i(P) + (1 - t)A_i(P)   and  \u03a6_i,t^2(P) = tD_i(P) + (1 - t)A_i+1(P).\n\n\nFor an illustration of the role of the matrices \u03a6_i,t^1(P) and \u03a6_i,t^2(P) in the construction, we refer the reader to Figure\u00a0<ref>. Having defined these maps, the main goal of the remainder of this subsection is to prove the following two lemmas.\n\nFor all i \u2265 1, A_i is an open map.\n\n\n\nFor all t \u2208 (0,1) and all i \u2265 1, \u03a6_i,t^1 and \u03a6_i,t^2 are open maps.\n\n\n\nSince the dimension of the domain and the codomain agree, it suffices to show that A_i is continuous injection (see for instance <cit.>). The continuity of the map A_i follows from the fact that a_i^+, a_i^-, b, \u03c6^' are continuous. Now, we only need to show that A_i is injective. Assume that for two P, P\u0303\u2208\ud835\udcab, we have\n\n    A_i(P) = A_i(P\u0303).\n\nWrite P = (a_0^+, a_0^-, b) and P\u0303 = (\u00e3_0^+, \u00e3_0^-, b\u0303).\nFrom (<ref>), b = b\u0303 and a_i^+(P)= a_i^+(P\u0303) which leads to a_0^+ = \u00e3_0^+. In addition, (<ref>) also implies that \u03c6^'(- a_i+1^-(P)) = \u03c6^'(- a_i+1^-(P\u0303)) and since \u03c6^'' > 0, a_i+1^-(P) = a_i+1^-(P\u0303) which leads to a_0^- = \u00e3_0^-. This proves the injectivity of A_i as wished.\n\n\n\nThe proof is divided into 2 similar steps. In the first, we treat \u03a6_i,t^1 and the second treats \u03a6_i,t^2. \n\nStep 1: We first prove that \u03a6_i,t^1 is an open map for all t \u2208 (0,1). Define the map \u03c0_1 ^2 \u00d7 2_\u2192^2 \u00d7 2_ as \n\n    \u03c0_1\n     (\n     [ a_11 a_12; a_12 a_22;      ])\n     =\n     [        a_11        a_12;        a_12 - \u03c6^'(a_11) ]\n\nand note that B_i = \u03c0_1 \u2218 A_i for all i \u2265 1. Define \u03c8_t^1 ^2 \u00d7 2_\u2192^2 \u00d7 2_ as \u03c8_t^1(X) = t \u03c0_1(X) + (1 - t)X and note that \u03a6_i,t^1 = \u03c8_t^1 \u2218 A_i. Since A_i is an open map by Lemma\u00a0<ref>, it suffices to show that \u03c8_t^1 is an open map. To show that \u03c8_t^1 is an open map, we will show that the differential has full rank (see for instance <cit.>). Instead of considering \u03c8_t^1 as a mapping from ^2 \u00d7 2_ to ^2 \u00d7 2_, we choose (without changing the notation) to view \u03c8_t^1 as a mapping from ^3 to ^3. Then \n\n    \u03c8_t^1(a_11, a_12, a_22) = (a_11, a_12, -t \u03c6^'(a_11) + (1 - t) a_22 )\n\nand the differential is\n\n    D \u03c8_t^1(a_11, a_12, a_22) = \n     [              1              0              0;              0              1              0; - t \u03c6^''(a_11)              0            1-t;                ].\n\nThen D \u03c8_t^1(a_11, a_12, a_22) = 1 - t > 0 for all t \u2208 (0,1), which means that \u03c8_t^1 is an open map. Hence \u03a6_i,t^1 is an open map. \n\nStep 2: We now prove that \u03a6_i,t^2 is an open map for all t \u2208 (0,1).\nBy standard arguments, \u03c6^' admits an inverse maps (\u03c6^')^-1. Define \u03c0_2 ^2 \u00d7 2_\u2192^2 \u00d7 2_ as\n\n    \u03c0_2\n     (\n     [ a_11 a_12; a_12 a_22;      ])\n     =\n     [ (\u03c6^')^-1(- a_22)             a_12;             a_12             a_22;                  ].\n\nNote that D_i = \u03c0_2 \u2218 E_i = \u03c0_2 \u2218 A_i+1 for all i \u2265 1. Define \u03c8_t^2 ^2 \u00d7 2_\u2192^2 \u00d7 2_ as \u03c8_t^2(X) = t \u03c0_2(X) + (1-t)X and note that \u03a6_i,t^2 = \u03c8_t^2 \u2218 A_i+1. Since A_i+1 is an open map, it suffices to show that \u03c8_t^2 is an open map to deduce that \u03a6_i,t^2 is an open map. We can proceed in the same way as in Step 1 to show that \u03c8_t^2 is an open map. This ends the proof.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Construction and parametrisation of interpolation laminates\n\nIn this subsection, the aim is to define new laminates with help of the interpolation maps from Subsection\u00a0<ref>. As explained in the beginning of this section, these laminates are needed to overcome the difficulty caused by the errors in Lemma\u00a0<ref>. Recall the definition of \u03bc^(i) in (<ref>). We consider this laminate but replace B_i(P) by \u03a6_i,t^1(P) and D_i(P) by \u03a6_i,t^2(P) (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). The coefficients corresponding to \u03bb_i^1(P), \u03bb_i^2(P) and \u03bb_i^3(P) in (<ref>) also have to be adapted. For all i and t \u2208 (0,1), we define\n\n    \u03bc^(i, i+1)_t(P) \u03bb_i,t^1(P) \u03b4_\u03a6_i,t^1(P) + \u03bb_i,t^2(P) \u03b4_\u03a6_i,t^2(P) + \u03bb_i,t^3(P) \u03b4_A_i+1(P)\n\nwhere\n\n    \u03bb_i,t^1(P) \u03bb_i^1(P)/t + (1-t)\u03bb_i^1(P),   \u03bb_i,t^2(P) \u03bb_i^2(P)/t + (1-t)\u03bb_i^1(P),   and  \u03bb_i,t^3(P) t \u03bb_i^3(P) - (1-t)\u03bb_i^2(P) /t + (1-t)\u03bb_i^1(P).\n\nBy Lemma\u00a0<ref>, there is T_0 \u2208 (0,1) and an integer I_1 \u2265 3 such that for all i \u2265 I_1 and all t \u2208 (T_0, 1) we have\n\n    1/r^2 < inf_t \u2208 (T_0, 1)inf_P \u2208\ud835\udcab\u03bb_i,t^3(P) \u2264sup_t \u2208 (T_0, 1)sup_P \u2208\ud835\udcab\u03bb_i,t^3(P) < 1/r^p + 2 \u03b4.\n\nBy standard computations, the barycenter of \u03bc^(i, i+1)_t(P) is \u03bc^(i, i+1)_t(P) = A_i(P). We define a new laminate of finite order \u03bc_t^(i,i+2)(P) by replacing the delta measure \u03b4_A_i+1(P) in (<ref>) by \u03bc_t^(i+1,i+2)(P). In other words,\n\n    \u03bc^(i, i+2)_t(P)    \u03bb_i,t^1(P) \u03b4_\u03a6_i,t^1(P) + \u03bb_i,t^2(P) \u03b4_\u03a6_i,t^2(P) + \u03bb_i,t^3(P) \u03bb_i+1,t^1(P) \u03b4_\u03a6_i+1,t^1(P) + \u03bb_i,t^3(P) \u03bb_i+1,t^2(P) \u03b4_\u03a6_i+1,t^2(P)\n            + \u03bb_i,t^3(P) \u03bb_i+1,t^3(P) \u03b4_A_i+2(P).\n\nWe continue in this way which results in the following definition\n\n    \u03bc^(i,j)_t(P)    \u2211_k = i^j-1( \u220f_m = i^k-1\u03bb_m,t^3(P) ) \u03bb_k,t^1(P) \u03b4_\u03a6_k,t^1(P) + \u2211_k = i^j-1( \u220f_m = i^k-1\u03bb_m,t^3(P) ) \u03bb_k,t^2(P) \u03b4_\u03a6_k,t^2(P)\n            + ( \u220f_m = i^j-1\u03bb_m,t^3(P) ) \u03b4_A_j(P)  \u2200 i < j, t \u2208 (0,1).\n\n Note that the barycenter of \u03bc_t^(i,j)(P) is \u03bc_t^(i,j)(P) = A_i(P). \n In order to correct errors (see Lemma\u00a0<ref>) and make sure that the gradients of our sequence of functions progressively approaches the set K_f, we define the following laminates of finite order\n \n    \u03bc^1, (i,j)_t,t^'(P) tt^'\u03b4_\u03a6_i,t^'^1(P) + ( 1 - tt^') \u03bc^(i,j)_t^'(P),\n\n\n    \u03bc^2, (i,j)_t,t^'(P) tt^'\u03b4_\u03a6_i,t^'^2(P) + ( 1 - tt^') \u03bc^(i+1,j)_t^'(P).\n\nNotice that the barycenter of these two laminates are \u03bc^1, (i,j)_t,t^'(P) = \u03a6_i,t^1(P) and \u03bc^2, (i,j)_t,t^'(P) = \u03a6_i,t^2(P). Now, we define collections of sets that will be useful in the proof in the next section. For each i \u2265 1 and t \u2208 (0,1), we define the sets\n\n    \ud835\udcb1_i  A_i(\ud835\udcab),   \ud835\udcb0_i^1  B_i(\ud835\udcab),   \ud835\udcb0_i^2  D_i(\ud835\udcab),   \ud835\udcb2_i,t^1 \u03a6_i,t^1(\ud835\udcab),   \ud835\udcb2_i,t^2 \u03a6_i,t^2(\ud835\udcab).\n\nBy Lemma\u00a0<ref> and <ref>, the sets \ud835\udcb1_i, \ud835\udcb2_i,t^1 and \ud835\udcb2_i,t^2 are open for all i \u2265 1 and t \u2208 (0,1).

This is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Why does this convex integration scheme yield infinitely many solutions with identical boundary datum?\n\nTo see that the convex integration scheme yields infinitely many solutions, all having the same boundary datum, we first observe that with v given by the scheme above\n\n    v - v_I _C^\u03b1(\u03a9; ^2)\u2264\u2211_j > I v_j - v_j-1_C^\u03b1(\u03a9; ^2)(<ref>)\u2264\u2211_j > I_j/2^j < _I \u2211_j > I1/2^j < _I < .\n\nKeep in mind that > 0 can be chosen arbitrarily at the beginning of the convex integration scheme. Assume for a contradiction that it is only possible to find finitely many v^(i) (i = 1 , \u2026, M) such that Dv^(i)\u2208 K_f a.e. Then select (recall that v_I(x) = Mx)\n\n    min_i = 1, \u2026, M v^(i) - v_I _C^\u03b1(\u03a9; ^2)/2.\n\nBy the convex integration scheme, we can construct a function \u1e7d\u2208 W^1,p(\u03a9; ^2) \u2229 C^\u03b1(\u03a9; ^2) such that \u1e7d - v_I _C^\u03b1(\u03a9; ^2) < and D \u1e7d\u2208 K_f a.e.. This is a contradiction. This proves that there are infinitely many solutions to (<ref>), all with identical boundary datum.\n\nplain\n\n\n"}
