We select \u223c3,500 SFGs that have both LOFAR 150 MHz and GMRT 610 MHz detections by removing AGN from the two radio samples, and obtain a median spectral index of \u03b1_150^610=-0.51\u00b10.01 with a scatter of \u03c3=0.2. Due to the relatively lower sensitivity of uGMRT 400 MHz data, we apply a flux cut of S_610>300 \u03bcJy and obtain the median spectral indices of \u03b1_150^385=-0.42^+0.03_-0.02, \u03b1_385^610=-0.44^+0.03_-0.04, and \u03b1_150^610=-0.42^+0.02_-0.01 for the sample of 258 SFGs that have detections at these three radio frequencies. The JVLA 5 GHz observations only cover the central 0.1 deg^2, where \u223c100 SFGs are selected, for which we obtain median \u03b1_610^5000=-1.14^+0.04_-0.05, \u03b1_385^5000=-1.08^+0.01_-0.02 and \u03b1_150^5000=-0.87\u00b10.01, with some selection bias towards the steeper spectrum because of the high sensitivity of the 5GHz data. Overall, the results show that the radio spectrum is flatter if we include a lower frequency dataset when measuring the radio spectral index at 150\u20135000 MHz. We study the correlations between radio spectral index and physical properties of radio-selected SFGs and find that, on average, the radio spectrum slightly steepens with increasing stellar mass. However, we only find that the radio spectrum flattens with increasing optical depth at V-band at \u03bd<\u223c1 GHz. We suggest that spectral ageing due to the energy loss of cosmic ray electrons and thermal free-free absorption could be among the most likely physical mechanisms that drive the two correlations respectively. Both of these could be the physical causes of why the radio spectrum is flatter at low frequency than at high frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\nradio continuum: galaxies \u2013 methods: observational \u2013 galaxies: formation \u2013galaxy: evolution \u2013galaxies: star formation \u2013galaxies: statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n \nThe radio continuum emission from star-forming galaxies (SFGs) consists of the non-thermal synchrotron radiation and thermal free-free emission. In SFGs, massive stars (M>8) explode to form Type II and Type Ib supernovae and accelerate cosmic ray (CR) electrons, which gyrate within large-scale galactic magnetic fields and produce radio emission via a synchrotron process <cit.>. The underlying physical process of free-free emission is powered by the Coulomb scattering between free ions and electrons in the  regions, which are ionised by young, massive stars. Therefore, both of these processes are associated with massive star formation in galaxies. These characteristics, as well as the radio emission's insensitivity to dust attenuation, make the radio continuum a powerful tool to study the astrophysical properties of SFGs <cit.>. \n\nAlthough the free-free emission traces a nearly instantaneous star formation <cit.>, it is very challenging to target it at gigahertz frequencies or below due to its flat spectrum (\u03b1\u223c-0.1, where S_\u03bd\u221d\u03bd^\u03b1). At \u03bd>\u223c30 GHz, thermal free-free radiation is expected to dominate the radio continuum emission, but the observation condition at such high-frequency range is stringent <cit.>. Therefore, although it is a delayed tracer of star formation (\u223c100 Myr), the non-thermal synchrotron emission, which has a steep spectrum of \u03b1\u223c-0.8, is widely used to study activities of SFGs in both the local and distance Universe <cit.>. \n\nOn galaxy-integrated scales, the radio continuum based star formation rate (SFR) is most often calibrated by an empirical correlation between far-infrared (FIR) and radio (typically at \u223c1.4 GHz) luminosities (the FIRRC), which appears to hold across several orders of magnitude in spatial scale, luminosity, gas surface density and photon/magnetic field density and with a modest evolution with redshift <cit.>. In addition, the FIRRC is also widely used to classify radio sources as either SFGs or radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) because it is characteristic of radio-loud AGN  activities to accelerate the CR electrons and cause an `excess' of radio emission <cit.>. Therefore, studies of SFGs based on radio continuum emission rely on a well-determined radio spectrum, especially at low frequency since the rest-frame \u223c1.4 GHz is shifted to \u03bd<1.4 GHz at high redshift. \n\nHowever, due to the lack (until recently) of high-sensitivity and large coverage low-frequency radio surveys and the fact that the radio spectra of SFGs are dominated by synchrotron radiation at \u03bd\u223c1-10 GHz, most of the studies based on rest-frame radio spectra of SFGs assumed a synchrotron spectrum or a synchrotron spectrum with 10% contribution from the free-free emission (\u03b1\u223c-0.7) when k-correcting the observed flux densities at \u223c1.4 GHz <cit.>. These assumptions will overestimate the radio flux density at low frequency because of a flattening of radio spectrum at \u03bd<\u223c1 GHz as suggested by some recent works <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt frequency \u03bd<\u223c1 GHz, besides the two emission processes, the spectra of SFGs are expected to be affected by additional physical mechanisms. Notably, the  regions become optically thick at \u03bd<\u223c1 GHz, where free-free absorption causes greater attenuation of lower-frequency synchrotron radiation. This effect has been observed in the Galactic centre and some nearby galaxies <cit.>, and it has been widely used to explain a flattening of radio spectrum at low frequency for both local and high-redshift galaxies <cit.>. However, some other studies suggest that thermal gas absorption might not be the main cause of a flattening of radio spectrum at low frequency, since, for instance, there is no correlation between the inclination of the galaxies and the flatness of their radio spectrum at low frequency <cit.>. Alternatively, the intrinsic steepening of the synchrotron spectrum, due to synchrotron and inverse Compton losses growing stronger at high CR energy, is used to explain why the high-frequency radio spectrum is steeper than the low-frequency in the literature <cit.>. Besides, the Razin-Tsytorich effect <cit.>, and the effects from relativistic bremsstrahlung and synchrotron self absorption are also expected to be more important at low frequency <cit.>.\n\nIn recent years, the high-sensitivity and wide field extragalactic radio continuum surveys conducted by the Low Frequency Array <cit.>, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope <cit.>, and Murchison Widefield Array <cit.> are finally allowing us to study the radio spectral properties at \u03bd_ obs<\u223c1 GHz with a statistically significant sample of SFGs. \n\nIn this work, we combine high-sensitivity LOFAR 150 MHz data, GMRT 610 MHz data, 400 MHz data from the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT), and 5 GHz data observed by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in the ELAIS-N1 field <cit.> to study radio spectral properties at observer-frame frequencies of 150\u20135000 MHz. Details of these radio data as well as the ancillary data used in this work are described in Section <ref>. We also summarise the main properties of these radio datasets in Table <ref>. We analyse the data and select SFGs from the radio surveys in Section <ref>. The measured radio spectral indices at different frequency ranges and the correlations between radio spectrum and physical properties of SFGs are presented in Section <ref>. Using these results, we discuss the underlying physical mechanisms that drive the radio spectrum at rest-frame \u223c150\u201310,000 MHz in Section <ref>. Our results are summarised in Section <ref>.\n\nThroughout this paper, we adopt the AB magnitude system <cit.> and assume a flat \u039bCDM cosmological model with the Hubble constant H_0 = 67.27 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, matter density parameter \u03a9_ m = 0.32, and cosmological constant \u03a9_\u039b = 0.68 <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA\n \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 LOFAR 150 MHz data\n \n\nThe LOFAR 150 MHz data of the ELAIS-N1 field used in this work are from the  LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey <cit.> Deep Fields <cit.>. The observations were taken with the High Band Antenna (HBA) array with frequencies between 115\u2013177 MHz in the LOFAR observation cycles 0, 2, and 4. The central frequency of the observation is 146.2 MHz. The final Stokes I image for all survey fields have a resolution of 6. The ELAIS-N1 field is the deepest of the LoTSS Deep Fields to date with an effective observing time of 163.7 hours <cit.>. The median RMS of the central 6.7 deg^2, where the highest-quality multi-wavelength data exists <cit.>, is 22.9 \u03bcJy beam^-1. Within this region, <cit.> created a final cross-matched and associated catalogue that contains 31,610 LOFAR 150 MHz radio sources (Figure\u00a0<ref>). We refer the reader to <cit.> for more details about the observations and data reduction of LOFAR 150 MHz data and to <cit.> for the creation of the final cross-matched and associated radio catalogue. We also present a short summary of the cross-matched results in Section <ref>. \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 uGMRT 400 MHz data\n \nThe ELAIS-N1 field was observed at 300\u2013500 MHz with the uGMRT in GTAC cycle 32 <cit.>. The observations cover an area of \u223c1.8 deg^2. With a total on-source time of \u223c13 hours, the observations reach an RMS noise of \u223c15 \u03bcJy beam^-1 near the centre of the field. The angular resolution of the image is 46\u00d743. <cit.> detected 2,528 >6 \u03c3 radio sources from the primary beam-corrected uGMRT 400 MHz image (Figure\u00a0<ref>). Details of observation, data reduction, and source detection are presented in <cit.>. \n\nWhen analysing the data, <cit.> used the 400 MHz (the central frequency) as the effective frequency of their observations. However, there are some satellite radio-frequency interference (RFI) with about 20 MHz width near 480 MHz, which means the data is not divided equally below and above 400 MHz. We therefore estimate an effective frequency of 385 MHz by considering this effect. We test the reliability of this estimation by measuring the radio spectral indices at observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013385 MHz, 385\u2013610 MHz and 150\u2013610 MHz for GMRT 610 MHz-detected sources with S_ 610 MHz>300 \u03bcJy. As we present in Section <ref>, using 385 MHz as the effective frequency results in the median spectral indices that are consistent with those in the literature. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 GMRT 610 MHz data\n \nThere are two sets of GMRT 610 MHz data of the ELAIS-N1 field used in this work. One is from the ELAIS-N1 610 MHz Deep Survey <cit.>. The other is from a wide-area GMRT 610 MHz survey of the ELAIS-N1 field <cit.>. The GMRT deep data include a set of pointings from the GMRT wide survey <cit.>.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 GMRT deep\n\nThe ELAIS-N1 610 MHz Deep Survey covers an area of 1.86 deg^2 in the centre of the field. The survey was carried out with seven closely spaced GMRT pointings with a on-source integration time of \u223c18 hours for each pointing <cit.>. The seven pointings were mosaicked to create the final image. To reduce the noise around the edge, <cit.> also includes a set of pointings with on-source time of 2.5 hours per pointing from GMRT wide survey in the final mosaic image. The median RMS noise of the final mosaic image is 19.5 \u03bcJy beam^-1 with a minimum noise of 7.1 \u03bcJy beam^-1 in the central region. The angular resolution of the GMRT deep image is 6. \n<cit.> detected 4,290 >5 \u03c3 radio sources from the final mosaic image (Figure\u00a0<ref>). We refer the reader to <cit.> for more details. \n \n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 GMRT wide\n\nThe wide-area GMRT 610 MHz survey covers an area of 12.8 deg^2 in the ELAIS-N1 field by using a total of 51 GMRT pointings. The on-source time for each pointing is \u223c2.5 hours and for the final mosaic data is 153 hours. The final mosaic image reaches an RMS noise of \u223c40 \u03bcJy beam^-1 and an angular resolution of 6. A total of 6,400 radio sources were detected from the final mosaic image (Figure\u00a0<ref>). Details of observations, data reduction, and source extraction are presented in <cit.>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 JVLA 5 GHz data\n \nThe JVLA 5 GHz observations only cover the central 0.13 deg^2 of the ELAIS-N1 field <cit.>. The bandwidth of the observation is 2 GHz and the central frequency is 5 GHz. With a total of 60 hours observation time, the JVLA 5 GHz data reaches an RMS noise of 1.05 \u03bcJy beam^-1. The angular resolution of the image is 25. In total, <cit.> detected 387 radio sources with S_ 5GHz>5 \u03bcJy from the image. Although <cit.> only focus on the polarized emission from these sources, we include their continuum emission in this work to measure the radio spectral index between the observer-frame frequencies of 150\u20135000 MHz.  \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Additional Multi-wavelength Data/Catalogues\n\nThe ELAIS-N1 field was originally chosen for deep extra-galactic observations with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) due to its low infrared background <cit.>. The deep infrared as well as the ultraviolet (UV) and optical observations make this field one of the best-studied astronomical fields. Since this work is based on the radio-selected SFGs, we do not use these multi-wavelength data directly but utilize the cross-matched results of GMRT 610 MHz radio sources from <cit.> and of LOFAR 150 MHz sources from <cit.>. We therefore give a short summary of the multi-wavelength data used in the cross-matches in their works and refer the reader to <cit.> and <cit.> for more details of these data. \n\n<cit.> determined the multi-wavelength counterparts of GMRT 610 MHz-detected radio sources by  using the Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (SERVS) DR2 firstly <cit.>. The SERVS Data Fusion project included most of the publicly available far-UV to FIR data and homogenized these data to estimate the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for IRAC 3.6  and/or 4.5 -selected sources <cit.>. \nFurthermore, if a SERVS match was not found, <cit.> used the J and K-band data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Deep Extragalactic Survey (DXS) <cit.> to identify counterparts to GMRT 610 MHz radio sources. We will be back to their cross-matched results in Section <ref>.\n\nIn addition to the deep 3.6  and 4.5  from the SERVS and near-infrared (NIR) J and K-band data from UKIDSS-DIS, the following datasets were also used by <cit.>:\n\n\n  * UV data from the Deep Imaging Survey (DIS) taken with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) space telescope <cit.>,\n\n  * u-band data from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-sequence Cluster Survey <cit.>,\n\n  * optical g, r, i, z, and y-band data from the Medium Deep Survey (MDS), one of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS-1) surveys <cit.>,\n\n  * the g, r, i, z, y-band, and the narrowband NB921 data from the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey <cit.>, and\n\n  * the mid-infrared (MIR) 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  data from the Spitzer Wide-area Infra-Red Extragalactic (SWIRE) survey <cit.>.\n\nIn addition, <cit.> included the far-infrared (FIR) data at 24  from the Multi-band Imaging Photometer for Spitzer <cit.> and at 100 , 160 , 250 , 360 , and 520  from Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic survey <cit.> in their multi-wavelength photometric catalogue that were used to cross-match with the LOFAR 150 MHz radio sources. We will introduce their cross-matched results in Section <ref>.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ANALYSIS\n\nTo investigate the radio spectral properties of radio-detected sources, we first check the consistency of the astrometry of sources detected at different radio frequencies. Then, we introduce the selection of SFGs from GMRT 610 MHz-detected sources in <cit.> and from LOFAR 150 MHz-detected sources in Best et al. submitted. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Astrometry\n\nTo test the relative astrometry of the radio sources detected at different frequencies, we first cross-match the radio sources detected at LOFAR 150 MHz, GMRT 610 MHz, uGMRT 400 MHz, and JVLA 5 GHz by using a matching radius of 10 . As shown in the top panels of Figure\u00a0<ref>, the astrometry of GMRT 610 MHz data, both GMRT deep and wide, is well-consistent with that of LOFAR 150 MHz data with the median offsets of \u0394 R.A. \u223c01 and the \u0394 Decl. \u223c004. However, the median astrometric offsets between uGMRT 400 MHz and LOFAR 150 MHz data are \u223c05 in both right ascension and declination. Such offsets result in relatively larger cross-matching radii between 400 MHz sources and the sources detected at LOFAR 150 MHz and GMRT 610 MHz as described in Section <ref>. The bottom-right panel of Figure\u00a0<ref> shows that the astrometry of JVLA 5 GHz data is consistent with that of LOFAR 150 MHz data very well with the  median offsets of \u0394 R.A. =-015 and the \u0394 Decl. =004.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 SFGs selection\n\nExcept the JVLA 5 GHz data, which have a very limited sky coverage, the LOFAR 150 MHz and GMRT 610 MHz (deep) data are the two deepest datasets that are utilised in studying radio spectral properties of the sources in this work. We therefore directly use the cross-matched results as well as the classification of SFGs and AGN in the two radio catalogues, i.e., the LOFAR 150 MHz catalogue presented in <cit.> and the GMRT 610 MHz catalogue presented in <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Cross-match and SFGs selection of 150 MHz sources\n\nTo produce a multi-wavelength photometric catalogue that is used for radio-optical/IR cross-match, <cit.> first created the pixel-matched images by using 20 UV to mid-IR bands data in the ELAIS-N1 field. Sources were detected from a \u03c7^2 sum of optical SpARCS-u, PS1-griz, and NIR UKIDSS-DXS J, K imaging data and a separate \u03c7^2 image that using only the Spitzer-IRAC 3.6  and 4.5  data from both the SWIRE and the SERVS (Section <ref>). This resulted in a multi-wavelength catalogue that contains \u223c1.5 million sources in the overlapping region of Pan-STARRs, UKIDSS-DXS, and Spitzer-SWIRE surveys. These sources were used for cross-match with the LOFAR radio catalogue. For the 31,610 LOFAR 150 MHz sources within the overlapping region, 97.6% (30,839/31,610) of them have been identified with an optical, and/or NIR, and/or MIR counterpart in <cit.>. \n\nThe photometric redshift and optical depth of these 150 MHz sources were estimated from the best-fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) by using the aperture-matched UV to MIR photometries presented in <cit.>. The photometric redshift was estimated by using a hybrid methodology that combines template fitting and machine learning. Details of the estimation are described in <cit.>. For the sources with z<1.5, <cit.> estimated their physical properties, including the optical depth, by adopting the SED fitting code MAGPHYS <cit.>. The fitting was done by determining the best-fit \u03c7^2 between the photometry and all possible models that satisfy the energy balance criterion (which links the energy absorbed at short wavelengths with that re-radiated by dust in the FIR), assuming a two-component dust model from \n<cit.> and an initial mass function from <cit.>. The optical depth is the natural logarithm of the difference between the unattenuated and attenuated best-fit model spectrum at V-band.\n\nTo do the source classification for these 150 MHz sources, Best et al. (submitted) fitted the aperture-matched multi-wavelength photometries using four different SED fitting codes, two of which <cit.> included AGN templates in the fitting, and two of which <cit.> did not. For CIGALE and AGNfitter, the output of the codes is the best estimate of the fraction of the mid-infrared light, which is contributed by the AGN (f_ AGN). Best et al. (submitted) used these two values of f_ AGN, combined with information on whether the CIGALE and AGNfitter codes provided a better overall fit to the data than BAGPIPES and MAGPHYS, to determine whether there was evidence for the presence of a radiative AGN in the SED. A significant contribution to this classification is the behaviour of the SED through the mid-IR region of the spectrum, where previous mid-IR colour-colour selection techniques have been used to identify AGN <cit.>. However, the use of the full SED information provides superior results, and is possible in ELAIS-N1 due to the high-quality multi-wavelength datasets. In total, Best et al. (submitted) classified 3,295 sources as hosting optical/IR AGN activity. For a total of 31,610 LOFAR 150 MHz sources, 1,072 of them are unable to be classified due to an absence of critical data, typically a photometric redshift. \n\nIn addition, Best et al. (submitted) also investigated the presence of radio AGN activity within the sample. Using the outputs of the four SED fitting codes, a consensus stellar mass and consensus SFR was derived for each object (see Best et al. (submitted) for details). Using an SFR to radio luminosity relation defined from the ridge-line of the distribution <cit.>, Best et al. (submitted) were able to identify those sources which showed more than 0.7 dex excess in radio luminosity relative to the value that would be predicted from their consensus SFR. In total, 4,797 sources were identified in this manner to be radio-excess AGN (of which 510 were also optical/IR selected AGN). And 1,314 sources remained unclassifiable. \n\nCombining the two sets of classifications, we obtain a sample of 22,720 SFGs, after removing all objects which were either classified as AGN through optical/IR or radio-excess selection, or were unclassifiable due to a lack of relevant data in one of the two diagnostics.\n \nFor the radio-detected SFGs, except the photometric redshift and optical depth at V-band from <cit.> and <cit.>, we also use the consensus stellar mass from Best et al. submitted in Section <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Cross-match and SFGs selection of 610 MHz sources\n\nFor the 4,290 GMRT 610 MHz-detected sources in <cit.>, 3,689 of them have a MIR counterpart from the SERVS and 3,542 have a NIR counterpart from the UKIDSS-DXS. Among them, 3,295 have been detected at both MIR and NIR. The multi-wavelength counterparts of these 610 MHz sources were identified by using their MIR and/or NIR positions. Based on these cross-match results, <cit.> carried out a multi-wavelength study using optical, X-ray, infrared, and radio diagnostics to identify AGN in their sample. We refer readers to <cit.>  for more details of the cross-match and SFG/AGN classification. Here we briefly summarize the results of their classification. \n\nFor the 4,290 GMRT 610 MHz sources in <cit.>, 3,490 of them have at least one measured multi-wavelength SFG/AGN classification diagnostic. Among them, \n\n\n  * 209 are classified as MIR AGN by adopting the MIR colour-colour selection criteria in <cit.>, \n\n  * 106 are optical spectroscopic AGN by using the BOSS CLASS and SUBCLASS parameters <cit.>, \n\n  * 102 are X-ray AGNs with L_ X>10^42 erg s^-1, and \n\n  * 340 are classified as radio loud AGN by comparing their MIR (MIPS 24 um) to radio flux ratio <cit.>. \n\nWe, therefore, remove a total of 648 AGNs and obtain a sample of 2,842 SFGs from the GMRT 610 MHz detected sources. \n\nFor the GMRT 610 MHz SFGs that have a LOFAR 150 MHz counterpart within 20 (the cross-match radius of the two datasets as we discussed in Section <ref>), 70% of them were also classified as SFGs in Best et al. submitted. However, 25% of them were classified as AGN, specifically, 17% were classified as radio AGN in Best et al. submitted. Therefore, the different selections of radio AGN cause the major difference between the source classifications presented in Best et al. submitted and <cit.>. The remaining 5% were unclassifiable due to a lack of measured diagnostic in Best et al. submitted. In this work, to obtain a clean sample of SFGs, we remove all AGN classified in <cit.> or Best et al. from our sample as presented in Section <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RESULTS\n \nBecause of the high sensitivity of LOFAR 150 MHz data, we use 610 MHz or 385 MHz as the selection frequency in studying radio spectral properties at observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013610 MHz and 150\u2013385 MHz (Section <ref> and <ref>) to obtain the relatively complete samples. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 GMRT-DEEP 610 MHz as the selection frequency\n\nWe first use the GMRT-DEEP 610 MHz as the selection frequency to measure the radio spectral index at observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013610 MHz. To include all possible 150 MHz counterparts of these 610 MHz-selected sources, we first use a cross-match radius of 10. For the 4,290 GMRT 610 MHz sources in <cit.>, 87% (3,748/4,290) of them have a LOFAR 150 MHz counterpart within 10. This fraction increases to 90% if we limit the 610 MHz sources to those with an associated redshift <cit.>. For the 2,842 GMRT 610 MHz-selected SFGs (Section <ref>), these fractions are also 87% (for all SFGs) and 90% (for SFGs with redshift) respectively. \n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Radio spectral index between the observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013610 MHz\n\n\nWe first measure the radio spectral index at observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013610 MHz, \u03b1_ 150^ 610, for a total of 2,462 GMRT 610 MHz-selected SFGs, which have a LOFAR 150 MHz counterpart within 10. The \u03b1_ 150^ 610 is measured by performing a linear fit in logarithmic space, and its uncertainty (\u03c3_150^610) is inherited from the uncertainties of the two flux densities. We show the \u03b1_ 150^ 610 as a function of the separation between the  GMRT 610 MHz and LOFAR 150 MHz detections in Figure\u00a0<ref>. The distribution of \u03b1_ 150^ 610 becomes asymmetric when the separation is greater than 20 as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We therefore choose r_ 150-610=20 as the cross-match radius when identifying the LOFAR 150 MHz counterparts for the 610 MHz selected SFGs. To reduce the contamination from AGN, we remove additional 590 GMRT 610 MHz sources that have a LOFAR 150 MHz counterpart within 20 and are classified as AGN in Best et al. submitted. The left panel of Figure\u00a0<ref> shows the measured \u03b1_150^610 for the remaining 1,782 SFGs.\n\nThere are 16 SFGs with r_ 150-610<20 but have the measured \u03b1_150^610-\u03c3_150^610>0.0 (very flat radio spectrum at 150\u2013610 MHz). We show their SNR at 150 MHz as a function of \u03b1_150^610 in the top-left inset plot in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We find that those SFGs with a flatter radio spectrum do have a lower SNR at 150 MHz. We also visually inspect both LOFAR 150 MHz and GMRT 610 MHz images and find that four of them are resolved as two components at LOFAR 150 MHz. \nWe therefore remove them from our sample. There are also two sources with \u03b1_150^610+\u03c3_150^610<-1.0 (very steep radio spectrum at 150\u2013610 MHz). Visually inspection shows that they are faint at GMRT 610 MHz. \n\nThere are 1,590 SFGs with r_ 150-610<20 after we remove the four SFGs that are resolved at 150 MHz. We show the distribution of their \u03b1_ 150^ 610 in the right plot of Figure\u00a0<ref>. The median is \u03b1_ 150 MHz^ 610 MHz=-0.51\u00b10.01 with a scatter of \u03c3=0.24 for these SFGs.\n\nFor the 4,290 GMRT 610 MHz-detected sources, 800 of them lack a measured diagnostic to classify them as SFGs or AGN in <cit.>. Among them, 667 have a LOFAR 150 MHz counterparts within 20 and 596/667 are classified as SFGs in Best et al. submitted. As shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>, the median \u03b1_ 150^ 610 of these 596 SFGs is \u03b1_ 150 MHz^ 610 MHz=-0.52\u00b10.01 with a standard deviation of \u03c3=0.26, which is highly consistent with the results shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We therefore measure the radio spectral index at observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013610 MHz for 2,186 GMRT 610 MHz-selected SFGs in total.\n\n\nFor the GMRT 610 MHz-selected sources in <cit.>, although the completeness of the detections at LOFAR 150 MHz is \u223c90%, we further check these sources without LOFAR 150 MHz counterparts. There are 327 GMRT 610 MHz-selected sources with estimated photometric redshift in <cit.> but not included in the LOFAR final cross-matched catalogue <cit.>. Our visual inspection shows that most of them are within the poor quality areas of the LOFAR map, such as near a bright source. We directly measure the pixel value at their 610 MHz positions and find 92% of them have the value >100 \u03bcJy beam^-1, which would correspond to a > 5\u03c3 detection in a cleaner part of the LOFAR image. Therefore, although these sources are not included in the LOFAR catalogue because of the inability to fit with a Gaussian profile, there is no reason to expect that this will bias our results.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Radio spectral properties at 150\u2013610 MHz\n\nFor the GMRT 610 MHz-selected SFGs, we show their radio spectral index between observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013610 MHz as functions of redshift, optical depth at V-band, and stellar mass in Figure\u00a0<ref>. The photometric redshifts for the total 2,186 SFGs are from the LOFAR multi-wavelength photometric catalogue <cit.>. To reduce the effect from incompleteness of our radio flux-limited sample, we limit SFGs to z<3 when fitting the correlations between \u03b1_150^610 and redshift (rest-frame frequency). We perform a linear fit by minimizing the \u03c7^2 and using the uncertainties of \u03b1_150^610 as the inverse weights. As shown in the left panel of Figure\u00a0<ref>, on average, the radio spectral slope at observer-frame 150\u2013610 MHz slightly flattens at low redshift (low frequency) with a \u223c3 \u03c3 significance. We further divide our sample into the massive (log (M_*/)>10.8) and less-massive (log (M_*/)\u226410.8) subsamples with sample sizes of 1,040 and 1,020 respectively. The correlation between \u03b1_150^610 and redshift of the two subsamples are consistent with that of the full sample with a linear fit slope of \u03b2=-0.03\u00b10.01, although the less-massive subsample is affected more by the incompleteness of our radio flux-limited sample. \n\n\nIn our sample, there are 1,481 SFGs with z<1.5, which have estimated optical depth at V-band, \u03c4_V, from <cit.>. As shown in the middle panel of Figure\u00a0<ref>, the radio spectrum at observer-frame 150\u2013610 MHz flattens with increasing optical depth. The linear fit slope of this correlation is \u03b2=-0.06\u00b10.01. We also divide the sample into massive (log (M_*/)>10.7) and less-massive (log (M_*/)\u226410.7) subsets with sample sizes of 718 and 763 respectively. We obtain the linear fit slopes of \u03b2=0.09\u00b10.01 and \u03b2=0.05\u00b10.01 for the two subsets respectively, which confirms that this trend is independent from the stellar mass of SFGs. \n\nTo reduce the effect of incompleteness, we limit our sample to log (M_*/)>10 when fitting the correlations between \u03b1_150^610 and stellar mass as shown in the right panel of Figure\u00a0<ref>. On average, the radio spectral slope at observer-frame 150\u2013610 MHz slightly steepens with increasing stellar mass for these radio-selected SFGs with a linear fit slope of \u03b2=-0.07\u00b10.01. We further divide our sample into high-redshift (z>0.9) and low-redshift (z\u22640.9) subsets and find that this trend is independent from redshift, with the linear fit slopes being \u03b2=-0.07\u00b10.01 and \u03b2=-0.09\u00b10.01 respectively. These results are consistent with our previous work based on the MeerKAT and VLA data in the COSMOS field <cit.>, although for a relatively higher frequency (observer-frame frequencies of 1.3\u20133 GHz).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 GMRT-WIDE 610MHz as the selection frequency\n\n\nWe also use the relatively shallower but wide GMRT 610 MHz data from <cit.> to study radio spectral properties between observer-frame frequency of 150\u2013610 MHz for radio-selected SFGs. For the 6,400 GMRT 610 MHz-detected sources <cit.>, 4,542 are within the region that has both LOFAR and multi-wavelength observations (Figure\u00a0<ref>). Among them, 4,070 (90%) have a LOFAR 150 MHz counterparts within 10 and 1,857 are classified as SFGs in Best et al. submitted. In addition, 1,258/6,400 overlap with GMRT-deep detected sources and 394 are classified as AGNs in <cit.>. The overlap between the two AGN samples is 342. We therefore select a total of 1,805 SFGs and measure their spectral indices between observer-frame frequency of 150\u2013610 MHz as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. \n\nWe also adopt r_150-610=20 as the cut when cross-matching the GMRT (wide) 610 MHz and LOFAR 150 MHz data as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. There are 48 sources with r<20 that have \u03b1_150^610-\u03c3_150^610>0.0 (very flat radio spectrum between observer-frame frequency of 150-610 MHz), and we show their SNR at 150 MHz as a function of \u03b1_150^610 in the top inset plot in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We visually inspect both LOFAR 150 MHz and GMRT 610 MHz images and find that six of these 48 sources are resolved as two components at LOFAR 150 MHz. We therefore remove these six sources in the following analyses. Besides, as shown in the top inset plot of Figure\u00a0<ref>, the sources with an extremely flatter radio spectrum at 150\u2013610 MHz have lower SNR at 150 MHz. For the remaining 1,711 SFGs with r_150-610<20, we obtain a median radio spectral index of \u03b1_150^610=-0.49\u00b10.01 with a scatter of \u03c3=0.26, which are well-consistent with the results based on the GMRT deep data (Section <ref>). We note that 396 of these SFGs are also included in the GMRT-deep sample shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\nFor the 1,711 GMRT-wide-detected SFGs, 1,296 with z<1.5 have estimated optical depth at V-band, \u03c4_V, from <cit.>. As shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>, on average, the radio spectrum at observed 150\u2013610 MHz for the GMRT-wide-selected SFGs also slightly flattens with increasing optical depth and steepens with increasing stellar mass. However, we do not find the weak correlation between \u03b1_150^610 and redshift (rest-frame frequency). This might be caused by the sample of SFGs being not as clean as the one based on GMRT-deep-detected sources (Section <ref>). Overall, the radio spectral properties of GMRT-wide selected SFGs are consistent with those based on the GMRT-deep selected sample. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 uGMRT 400 MHz as the selection frequency\n\n\nWe use the uGMRT 400 MHz-detected sources from <cit.> to study radio spectrum between observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013385 MHz and 385\u2013610 MHz respectively. As we describe in Section <ref>, the effective frequency of uGMRT 400 MHz used in this work is 385 MHz. For the 2,528 uGMRT 400 MHz radio sources from <cit.>, 2,219 (88%) have a LOFAR 150 MHz counterpart within 10. Among them, 1,255 are classified as SFGs in Best et al. submitted. In addition, 2,113 of the 2,528 uGMRT 400 MHz sources have a GMRT 610 MHz counterpart within 10. Among them, 1180 are within 25 and 401/1,180 are classified as AGNs in <cit.>. The overlap between the two AGN samples from Best et al. submitted and <cit.> is 340. Therefore, we remove the additional 61 AGN from our sample and obtain a sample of 1,194 SFGs. \n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Radio spectral indices at observed 150\u2013385 MHz and 385\u2013610 MHz\n\nWe show the radio spectral index between observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013385 MHz as a function of the separation between LOFAR 150 MHz and uGMRT 400 MHz detections for these 1,194 SFGs in the left panel of Figure\u00a0<ref>. According to the distribution of \u03b1_150^385, we choose r_ 150-385=25 as the cut when cross-matching the uGMRT 400 MHz and LOFAR 150 MHz sources. There are 20 SFGs with r_ 150-385<25 that have \u03b1_150^385-\u03c3_150^385>0.3, which means that they have very flat radio spectra at observed 150\u2013385 MHz. Our visual inspection shows that three of them are resolved as two components at LOFAR 150 MHz. There are also two SFGs with \u03b1_150^385+\u03c3_150^385<-0.8, i.e., with very steep radio spectra at observed 150\u2013385 MHz. We find that both of them are resolved at LOFAR 150 MHz. We therefore remove these five sources from our sample and show the distribution of \u03b1_150^385 for the remaining 1,158 SFGs with r_ 150-385<25 in Figure\u00a0<ref>. The median radio spectral index between observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013385 MHz is \u03b1_150^385=-0.29\u00b10.01 with a scatter of \u03c3=0.31. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the 1,194 SFGs that have both uGMRT 400 MHz and LOFAR 150 MHz detections, 1,038 also have a GMRT 610 MHz counterpart within 10. We show their radio spectral indices  between observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013610 MHz as a function of the separation between LOFAR 150 MHz and GMRT 610 MHz detections in the middle panel of Figure\u00a0<ref>. Among them, 896 have r_ 150-610 MHz<20 after we remove the sources that are resolved at LOFAR 150 MHz. The median \u03b1_150^610 for these 896 uGMRT 400 MHz-selected SFGs is \u03b1_150^610=-0.52\u00b10.01 with a scatter of \u03c3=0.23, which is consistent with the results based on GMRT 610 MHz-detected SFGs (Section <ref> and <ref>).\n\nWe also show the radio spectral index between observer-frame frequencies of 385\u2013610 MHz as a function of the separation between uGMRT 400 MHz and GMRT 610 MHz detections for the 1,038 uGMRT 400 MHz-selected SFGs that have a GMRT 610 MHz counterpart within 10 in the right panel of Figure\u00a0<ref>. According to the distribution of \u03b1_385^610, we choose r_ 385-610=25 as the cut when cross-matching uGMRT 400 MHz and GMRT 610 MHz sources. There are 926 uGMRT 400 MHz-selected SFGs that have r_ 385-610<25 after we remove the SFGs that are resolved at LOFAR 150 MHz. The median spectral index is \u03b1_385^610=-0.91^+0.02_-0.03 with a scatter of \u03c3=0.66. \nThe differences in spectral slope above and below 385 MHz occur because of the relatively shallower uGMRT 400 MHz data, i.e., the radio spectral indices we measured are flatter over the 150\u2013385 MHz and steeper over the 385\u2013610 MHz (Eddington bias). \n\nTo get a less biased sample in studying radio spectrum at observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013385 MHz and 385\u2013610 MHz, we instead select the sample for study by applying a flux density cut at GMRT 610 MHz. The coverages of GMRT deep 610 MHz and uGMRT 400 MHz are slightly offset as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. Within the overlapped region, only 47% (2,024/4,269) of GMRT 610 MHz sources have a 400 MHz counterpart within 10. We therefore limit the sources to S_ 610 MHz>300 \u03bcJy to guarantee that >80% of GMRT 610 MHz sources have a 400 MHz counterpart. Within the overlapped region, there are 303 SFGs with S_ 610 MHz>300 \u03bcJy. Among them, 258 have a 400 MHz counterpart within 25. All of them also have a LOFAR 150 MHz counterpart within 20 thanks to the high sensitivity of LOFAR data. The median spectral index between observer-frame frequency of 150\u2013385 MHz, 385\u2013610 MHz, and 150\u2013610 MHz are \u03b1_150^385=-0.42^+0.03_-0.02, \u03b1_385^610=-0.44^+0.03_-0.04, and \u03b1_150^610=-0.42^+0.02_-0.01, which are consistent with the results from nearby brighter galaxies <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Radio spectral properties at 150\u2013385 MHz and 385\u2013610 MHz\n\n\nFor SFGs with S_ 610 MHz>300 \u03bcJy and with detections at GMRT 610 MHz, uGMRT 400 MHz, and LOFAR 150 MHz, we show the correlations between their radio spectral indices and redshift, optical depth at V-band, and stellar mass in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We find that, on average, the radio spectra at observer-frame frequency of 150\u2013385 MHz and 385\u2013610 MHz are not significantly correlated with redshift, i.e., rest-frame frequency, but flatten with increasing optical depth and steepen with increasing stellar mass. Consequently, the difference between radio spectral indices at observer-frame frequency of 150\u2013385 MHz and 385\u2013610 MHz, i.e., spectral curvature, is not correlated with these physical properties as shown in the third row of Figure\u00a0<ref>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 JVLA 5 GHz as the selection frequency\n \nAlthough the JVLA 5 GHz observations only cover the central 0.13 deg^2 of the ELAIS-N1 field, the sensitivity reaches \u223c1 \u03bcJy beam^-1. We therefore use JVLA 5 GHz as the selection frequency to study the radio spectral properties for radio-selected SFGs at observer-frame frequencies of 150\u20135000 MHz. \n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Radio spectral indices at observed 150\u20135000 MHz\n\n\nBecause of a relatively higher angular resolution of JVLA 5 GHz data, we use a radius of 30 when cross-matching the JVLA 5 GHz sources with the radio sources detected at 610 MHz, 400 MHz, or 150 MHz. We find that applying a smaller matching radius, i.e., 15, does not change the median radio spectral indices at observer-frame frequencies of 385-5000 MHz and 150-5000 MHz, and only makes the median radio spectrum at 610-5000 MHz slighter flatter. We therefore keep all the 610 MHz, 400 MHz, and 150 MHz sources that are matched with the JVLA 5 GHz within 30 in the following analyses. \n\nFor the 387 JVLA 5 GHz-detected sources in <cit.>, 210 of them are cross-matched with a GMRT 610 MHz sources within 30. Among them, 137 are classified as SFGs in <cit.>. We also remove 72 JVLA 5 GHz sources that have a LOFAR counterparts and are classified as AGN by Best et al. submitted. The overlap of the two AGN samples is 35. For the remaining 100 SFGs, we show the measured radio spectral index at observer-frame frequency of 610\u20135000 MHz, \u03b1_610^5000, as a function of the separation between JVLA 5 GHz and GMRT 610 MHz detections in Figure\u00a0<ref>. The median is \u03b1_610^5000=-1.14^+0.03_-0.05 with a scatter of \u03c3=0.32. \n\nThere are 168 of the 387 JVLA 5 GHz sources that have an uGMRT 400 MHz counterpart within 30. By removing the 31 and 65 AGN classified in <cit.> and Best et al. submitted respectively, we obtain a median radio spectral index of \u03b1_385^5000=-1.08_-0.02^+0.01 for a sample of 81 SFGs (Figure\u00a0<ref>). The standard deviation of the measured radio spectral indices for these SFGs is \u03c3=0.21.\n\nThere are 217 JVLA 5 GHz sources that are matched with a LOFAR 150 MHz source within 30. Among them 133 are classified as SFGs in Best et al. submitted. We also remove additional five AGN that are classified in <cit.>. For the remaining 128 SFGs in our sample, the median radio spectral index at observer-frame frequency of 150\u20135000 MHz is \u03b1_150^5000=-0.87^+0.01_-0.02 with a scatter of \u03c3=0.18. \n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Radio spectral properties at observed 150\u20135000 MHz\n\nWe show the measured radio spectral indices at observer-frame frequencies of 610\u20135000 MHz, 385\u20135000 MHz and 150\u20135000 MHz as functions of redshift, optical depth at V-band, and stellar mass in Figure\u00a0<ref>. We find that, on average, the radio spectrum of SFGs slightly steepens with increasing redshift and stellar mass at 150\u20135000 MHz.\nHowever, there is no significant correlation between radio spectral index and optical depth at V-band, which is different from that at low-frequency (\u03bd<\u223c1 GHz, Figure\u00a0<ref> and Figure\u00a0<ref>).\n\nFor the 100 SFGs that have both JVLA 5 GHz and GMRT 610 MHz (deep) detections, 82 of them also have a LOFAR 150 MHz counterpart within 20 (the cross matching radius between GMRT 610 MHz and LOFAR 150 MHz sources). Although the sample size is very limited and the JVLA 5 GHz data is deeper than the data at the other two frequencies, we find that the difference between radio spectral indices at observer-frame frequencies of 150\u2013610 MHz and 610\u20135000 MHz is not correlated with redshift (rest-frame frequency) and stellar mass but positively correlated with optical depth at V-band weakly. This is not surprising given the lack of significant correlation between the radio spectral index and the V-band optical depth at \u03bd>\u223c1 GHz as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISCUSSION\n\nBy combining the LOFAR 150 MHz, uGMRT 400 MHz, GMRT 610 MHz, and JVLA 5 GHz data in the ELAIS-N1 field, we study the radio spectral properties at observer-frame frequencies of 150\u20135000 MHz. Here we discuss the possible physical mechanisms that determine the radio spectrum at this frequency range. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Radio spectral indices at observer-frame 150\u20135000 MHz\n\nBy using the two radio datasets with the greatest sensitivity and coverage in this work, we obtain a total of \u223c3,500 SFGs that have detections at both GMRT 610 MHz and LOFAR 150 MHz and a median spectral index of \u03b1_610^150=-0.51\u00b10.01. Our measurement is consistent with the median spectral indices at similar frequency ranges of nearby galaxies <cit.> and submillimeter-selected galaxies <cit.>. We note that <cit.> and <cit.> also include the \u223c150 MHz data in their analyses from the LOFAR Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey and the LoTSS respectively. However, compared with the median radio spectral index at high frequency, specifically, at rest-frame \u223c1.3\u201310 GHz in <cit.>, as well as the synchrotron spectrum, the radio spectrum of SFGs is flatter at \u03bd_ rest<\u223c1 GHz. \n\n\nJVLA 5 GHz data have an RMS noise of 1.05\u03bcJy, which corresponds to \u223c6\u03bcJy, \u223c8\u03bcJy, and \u223c17\u03bcJy at 610 MHz, 385 MHz, and 150 MHz respectively if we assume a radio spectral index of \u03b1=-0.8 (synchrotron spectrum). Therefore, using 5 GHz as the selection frequency biases the sample to SFGs with a relatively steeper radio spectrum, which causes the median radio spectral slope at observer-frame frequencies of 610\u20135000 MHz, 385\u20135000 MHz and 150\u20135000 MHz to be steeper than that of the synchrotron spectrum as shown in Section <ref>. \n\nAlthough including the JVLA 5 GHz data biases the sample to SFGs with a relatively steeper radio spectrum because of the high-sensitivity of the data, the radio spectrum is flatter if we include a lower frequency dataset when measuring the radio spectral index between observer-frame frequency of 150\u20135000 MHz as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. However, the high-sensitivity of LOFAR 150 MHz data is also the reason for a flatter radio spectrum at 150\u20135000 MHz. Based on the correlations between radio spectral indices and physical properties of SFGs we find in this work, we will discuss the possible physical mechanisms that cause the radio spectrum to be flatter at low frequency (\u03bd_ rest<\u223c1 GHz) than at high frequency in Section <ref>. \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Radio spectral properties at observer-frame 150\u20135000 MHz\n\n For radio-selected SFGs, we find that, on average, their radio spectrum slightly steepens with increasing stellar mass at any frequency ranges analysed in this work. However, we only find that at \u03bd_ obs<\u223c1 GHz, the radio spectrum of SFGs slightly flattens with increasing optical depth. This results a positive correlation between spectral curvature (\u03b1_150^610-\u03b1_610^5000) and optical depth at V-band. At \u03bd_ obs<\u223c1 GHz, the difference between radio spectra indices (\u03b1_150^385-\u03b1_385^610) is not significantly correlated with physical properties of SFGs. This phenomenon has been reported in <cit.>, which found that the spectral curvature at observer-frequency of 150\u20131400 MHz does not dependent on redshift, SFR, and specific SFR of SFGs. In addition, the median radio spectral indices we measured at 150\u20135000 MHz indicate that the radio spectrum is flatter at low frequency than at high frequency. Here we discuss the possible explanations of these correlations. \n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Radio spectrum steepens with increasing stellar mass\n\nAt observer-frame frequency of 150\u20135000 MHz, we find that the radio spectrum slightly steepens with increasing stellar mass. This correlation has been reported in our previous work that studied radio spectral properties at observer-frame frequency of 1.3\u20133 GHz by combining the MeerKAT 1.3 GHz and VLA 3 GHz data in the COSMOS field <cit.>. In that work, we noted that this correlation could be explained by age-related synchrotron loss. For the relativistic CR electron, the critical frequency, at which the electron emits most of its energy, is proportional to the square of its energy and the strength of the perpendicular component of the magnetic field, i.e, \n\n    \u03bd_ c\u221d E^2 B_.\n\nIf we only take synchrotron radiation in account, the lifetime of a CR electron is \n\n    t_ sy\u221d\u03bd_ c^-0.5 B_^-1.5.\n\nTherefore, high-energy CR electrons lose their energy faster than that of low-energy CR electrons. Similarly, the inverse Compton loss of these CR electrons is also greater at high frequency <cit.>. For SFGs, fresh CR electrons are constantly injected in the star-forming regions, which keeps the radio spectral slope constant. We therefore discussed in <cit.> that the slightly increased ratio of aged and young relativistic CR electrons with increasing stellar mass, could be a physical cause leading to radio spectrum steepening for massive SFGs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Radio spectrum flattens with increasing optical depth at \u03bd<\u223c1 GHz\n\nAt \u03bd_ obs<\u223c1 GHz, the radio spectrum of SFGs slightly flattens with increasing optical depth at V-band. However, this correlation is not found when we include the high-frequency JVLA 5 GHz data, although the sample size of 5 GHz-detected sources is very limited because of the small coverage of the data. \n\nThe effective optical depth at V-band depends on the relative distribution of the diffuse gas and dust along the line of sight. SFGs with higher optical depth at V-band are expected to have higher column density of free electron (n_ e) along the line of sight. Besides, these electrons might be more associated with colder regions around the star formation sites in SFGs. Therefore they are affected more by free-free absorption because the absorption coefficient has the following form <cit.>:\n\n    \u03ba\u221d n_e^2 T_e^-1.35 \u03bd^-2.1,\n\nwhere T_ e is the electron temperature of the  emitting region. This equation and other theoretical models as well as previous observations show that the effect of thermal free-free absorption increases at low frequency <cit.>, which explains why we only find the correlation between optical depth at V-band and radio spectrum at low frequency. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The low-frequency radio spectrum is flatter than the high-frequency\n\nAs discussed in Section <ref>, our measured median radio spectral index at observer-frame frequency of 150\u201350000 MHz show that, on average, the radio spectrum of SFGs is flatter at low frequency than at high frequency. However, when we investigate the measured radio spectral index as a function of rest-frame frequency (redshift) at either frequency range, i.e., 150-610 MHz (Figure\u00a0<ref>) or 385\u2013610 MHz (Figure\u00a0<ref>), we only find a very weak or even negligible correlation because of the large scatter of measured radio spectral indices at any given rest-frame frequencies. \n\nThe correlations of SFGs' radio spectral slope with the stellar mass and with the optical depth at V-band suggest that both spectral ageing of CR electrons and thermal free-free absorption could be the physical causes of why the radio spectrum is flatter at low frequency than at high frequency. These two physical mechanisms are also used as the main explanations for the different radio spectral slopes at low and high frequency in the literature <cit.>. The other mechanisms, such as synchrotron self-absorption and the Razin-Tsytovich effect, may also flatten the radio spectrum at low-frequency. However, synchrotron self-absorption requires extremely high brightness temperatures in order to be significant, and so its impact in SFGs is expected to be weak <cit.>. The Razin-Tsytovich effect can suppress synchrotron emission below the Razin frequency,\n\n    \u03bd_ R\u221d n_eB^-1.\n\nThis effect may dominate over internal free-free absorption when the thermal gas is considerably hotter than 10^4 K, which is rarely attained by normal SFGs <cit.>. \n\n\nAs shown by Equation <ref> to <ref>, the magnetic field (B), column density of free electrons (n_e), and electron temperature (T_ e) in the  region are the key features of the physical mechanisms that are responsible for the different radio spectral slopes at low and high frequency discussed above. Studies of radio spectrum of nearby galaxies and theoretical simulations of CR electron propagation discussed the effect of these individual physical parameters as well as some other physical conditions, such as galactic wind <cit.>. \n\nIn contrast, one advantage of our statistical studies is the ability to suggest possible causes of why the radio spectrum is flatter at low frequency than at high frequency. In particular, we find that the correlations between the SFGs' integrated radio spectrum and their astrophysical properties could lend support to spectral ageing and thermal free-free absorption as two possible main mechanisms for our samples.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSION\n\nBy combining high-sensitivity LOFAR 150 MHz, uGMRT 400 MHz, GMRT 610 MHz, and JVLA 5 GHz data in the ELAIS-N1 field, we measure the radio spectral indices between observer-frame frequency of 150\u20135000 MHz and study their correlations with physical properties of SFGs. The main conclusions from our work are as follows.\n\n1) We obtain \u223c3,500 SFGs that have detections at both GMRT 610 MHz and LOFAR 150 MHz by removing AGN from the two radio samples. The median radio spectral index for these SFGs is \u03b1^610_150=-0.51\u00b10.01 with a scatter of \u03c3=0.2. Therefore, the radio spectrum at 150\u2013610 MHz is flatter than that at high frequency (\u03bd_ rest>\u223c1 GHz) and the synchrotron spectrum. \n\n2) Because of the relatively low-sensitivity of uGMRT 400 MHz data, we limit our sample to the SFGs with S_ 610 MHz>300 \u03bcJy, and obtain a median spectral indices of \u03b1^385_150=-0.42^+0.03_-0.02, \u03b1^610_385=-0.44^+0.03_-0.04 and \u03b1^610_150=-0.42^+0.02_-0.01. \n\n3) Although JVLA 5 GHz data has very limited coverage, and its high-sensitivity biases the sample to SFGs with a relatively steeper radio spectrum, we obtain median \u03b1_610^5000=-1.14^+0.04_-0.05, \u03b1_385^5000=-1.08^+0.01_-0.02 and \u03b1_150^5000=-0.87\u00b10.01 for samples of \u223c100 SFGs that have detections at the two corresponding frequencies. Therefore, we find that the radio spectrum is flatter if we include a lower frequency dataset, although the high sensitivity of LOFAR 150 MHz data is also the reason for a flatter radio spectrum at 150\u20135000 MHz. \n\n4) We correlate the measured radio spectral indices with physical properties of SFGs and find that, on average, the radio spectrum steepens with increasing stellar mass at observer-frame frequency of 150\u20135000 MHz. We discuss that the spectral ageing due to the energy loss of\nrelativistic CR electrons via synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation could explain this trend. \n\n5) At \u03bd_ obs<\u223c1 GHz, we find that, on average, the radio spectrum slightly flattens with increasing optical depth at V-band of radio-selected SFGs. However, this correlation is not found when we include the high-frequency JVLA 5 GHz data. We suggest that thermal free-free absorption is a possible underlying physical mechanism of this correlation. \n\n6) Our statistical study of the correlation between integrated radio spectrum and physical properties of SFGs suggests the spectral ageing of CR electrons and thermal free-free absorption as two main physical mechanisms that cause the radio spectrum to be flatter at low frequency than at high frequency.\n\n\nFXA and MV acknowledge financial support from the Inter-University Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy (IDIA), a partnership of the University of Cape Town, the University of Pretoria, the University of the Western Cape, and the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory.
