The general objective is to find a path plan to a goal region that requires minimal\nsensing effort. In [1], the information-geometric RRT* (IG-RRT*) algorithm was  proposed to\nefficiently   find   such   a   path.   However,   like   any   stochastic   sampling-based   planner,   the\ncomputational complexity of IG-RRT* grows quickly, impeding its use with a large number of\nnodes. To remedy this limitation, we suggest running IG-RRT* with a moderate number of\nnodes, and then using a smoothing algorithm to adjust the path obtained. To develop a\nsmoothing algorithm, we explicitly formulate the minimum sensing path planning problem as\nan   optimization   problem.   For   this   formulation,   we   introduce   a   new   safety   constraint   to\nimpose a bound on the probability of collision with obstacles in continuous-time, in contrast\nto   the   common   discrete-time   approach.   The   problem   is   amenable   to   solution   via   the\nconvex-concave   procedure   (CCP).   We   develop   a   CCP   algorithm   for   the   formulated\noptimization and use this algorithm for path smoothing. We demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed approach through numerical simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAdvancements in sensing and computer vision techniques over the last decades have facilitated the acquisition of  ample amounts of information for robot navigation. However, using all the available data can result in  long processing times; draining the available computational power and communication bandwidth. \nOne popular approach for managing the overhead of intense information processing is the strategic use of available sensory data as opposed to full deployment. For instance, in <cit.>, several feature selection algorithms are proposed and compared for efficient visual odometry/visual simultaneous localization and mapping. In <cit.> the features that contribute the most to state estimation are incorporated meanwhile others are ignored. In the same line of research, <cit.> incorporated a restriction on the sensing budget into an optimal control problem and proposed an algorithm for control and sensing co-design. In <cit.>, an attention mechanism is proposed for the optimal allocation of sensing resources.\n\n\n\nExecuting different path plans requires different amounts of sensory data.\n\nThus, it is crucial for an autonomous system to be able to find path plans that require minimal sensing. To achieve this capability, <cit.>  and <cit.> established the minimum sensing path planning paradigm, \n\nwhere a pseudo-metric is introduced for Gaussian belief space to quantify the\naugmented  control and information costs incurred in the transition between two arbitrary states. The work <cit.> proposed  an asymptotically optimal <cit.> sampling-based motion planner, referred to as information-geometric RRT* (IG-RRT*) to find the shortest path in the introduced metric.\n\n\n\n\nThe success of IG-RRT* in providing optimal path plans in obstacle-cluttered environments is verified through simulation in <cit.>. However, like any RRT* algorithm, the time complexity of IG-RRT*  with n nodes grows as \ud835\udcaa(nlog n) <cit.>. This complexity restricts finding a precise approximation of the optimal path plan directly by deploying  IG-RRT* for a large number of steps. We thus propose a two-stage procedure to circumvent this computational limitation of IG-RRT*. In the first stage, the algorithm is run for a moderate number of iterations to find an approximation of the optimal path. The path sought in this stage is \u201cjagged\" in most cases due to the stochastic nature of IG-RRT*. In the second stage, this path is \u201csmoothed\" toward the optimal path using gradient-based solvers.\n\nPerforming the second stage requires the minimum sensing path problem to be formulated explicitly as a shortest path problem with safety constraints ensuring a small probability of collision with obstacles. The explicit formulation of the shortest path problem in the belief space with safety constraints is a well-studied problem, and a core element of chance-constrained (CC) motion planners <cit.>. \nCC planners impose a set of deterministic constraints (e.g., see <cit.>) which ensure the instantaneous probability of collision with half-space obstacles is bounded at discrete time steps. \n\nThe probability of collision with polyhedral obstacles is bounded \nusing probabilistic bounds like  Boole's inequality <cit.>. Constraints that aim to bound the collision probability in continuous time, that is, in the transition between discrete-time steps, are less explored. <cit.> and <cit.> are among a few papers that studied continuous-time safety constraints using the reflection principle and cumulative Lyapunov exponent formulation, respectively. Yet, these papers only provide constraints to bound the probability of collision with half-space obstacles. \n\n\nIn this work, we derive novel safety constraints that directly bound the probability of collision with polyhedral obstacles in both discrete and continuous time. Our derivation is obtained using  strong duality and the theorem of alternatives <cit.>. Using the proposed safety constraints, we formulate the minimum sensing path problem explicitly. We partially convexify the resulting optimization and represent it as a difference of convex (DOC) program. By exploiting the DOC form, we devise an iterative algorithm that starts from the feasible solution obtained by IG-RRT* at stage one, and monotonically \nsmooths the path toward a locally optimal path using gradient-based solvers. The devised algorithm is the implementation of the convex-concave procedure (CCP) <cit.> for the formulated problem.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation:  We write vectors in lower case x and matrices in upper case X. Let \ud835\udd4a_+^d={P\u2208\u211d^d \u00d7 d: P=P^\u22a4\u227b 0 } and x denote the 2-norm of x. For positive integers i<j, [i:j] denotes the set {i,  i+1, \u2026,  j} and  [j]=[1:j]. x\u223c\ud835\udca9(x,P) denotes a Gaussian random variable with mean x and covariance P. The unit interval {a \u2208\u211d: 0\u2264 a \u2264 1} is denoted by int and the zero vector in \u211d^f by 0_f. For vectors \u2265 denotes element-wise inequality, e.g. a\u2265 0_f.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PRELIMINARIES\n\n\nAs in <cit.> and <cit.>, we model the minimum sensing navigation of a robot as a shortest path problem in Gaussian belief space \u211d^d\u00d7\ud835\udd4a^d_+. In this setting, we search for the optimal joint control-sensing plan that drives the robot from an initial state to a target region while achieving the minimum steering cost (defined in Subsection\u00a0<ref>) and a bounded probability of collision with obstacles.  \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Assumed Dynamics\n\nWe assume that the robot's dynamics are governed by a controlled Ito process\n\n\n\n    dx(t)=v(t) dt+ N^1/2 db(t),\n\n\nwhere x(t) \u2208\u211d^d is the state  of the robot at time t with initial x(0)\u223c\ud835\udca9(x_0, P_0), v(t) is the velocity input command, b(t) is  d-dimensional standard\nBrownian motion, and N \u2208\ud835\udd4a^d is the process noise intensity.[ In practice, the path planning strategy we propose is applicable even if the robot's actual dynamics are different from  \n(<ref>). See <cit.> for further discussion.] We assume that the robot is commanded at constant periods of \u0394 t, and the control input is applied using a zero-order hold converter. Under these assumptions, (<ref>) can be discretized via\n\n\n\n    x_k = x_k-1+ u_k-1+w_k-1,\n\n\nwhere x_k is a state of the robot at time t=k\u0394 t, u_k-1=v(t_k-1)\u0394 t, and w_k-1\u223c\ud835\udca9(0, W := N \u0394 t).\n\nLet the probability distributions of the robot's state at\na given time step k-1 be parameterized by a Gaussian model x_k-1\u223c\ud835\udca9(x_k-1, P_k-1). After exerting the deterministic feed-forward control input u_k-1, the covariance propagates linearly to P\u0302_k=P_k-1+W, and the \nrobot's state becomes  (x_k=x_k-1+u_k-1, P\u0302_k) prior to the measurement at t_k. After the measurement at t_k, the covariance is reduced to the posterior covariance P_k\u225c (P\u0302_k^-1+S_k)^-1\u227cP\u0302_k, where S_k\u2208\ud835\udd4a_+^d is the information content of the measurement.[ See <cit.> \nthat explains how a given S_k is realized by an appropriate choice of sensors.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Steering Cost\n\n\nThe cost incurred during t_k-1\u2192 t_k is defined as the weighted sum of control cost D_cont,k and the information acquisition cost D_info,k, as \n\n    \ud835\udc9f_k\u225c\ud835\udc9f_cont,k+ \u03b1\ud835\udc9f_info,k,\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the weight factor. The control cost is simply the control input power \ud835\udc9f_cont,k\u225cu_k-1^2=x_k-x_k-1^2.\nThe information cost is the entropy reduction incurred at the end of transition t_k-1\u2192 t_k, defined as\n\ud835\udc9f_info,k\u225c1/2logP\u0302_k - 1/2log P_k.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Collision Constraints\n\n\nWe assume the path planning is to be performed inside a polyhedral domain \ud835\udcb3_dom := { x\u2208\u211d^d: a_dom,l^\u22a4 x \u2264 b_dom,l, l \u2208 [L] }, which is filled with polyhedral obstacles\n\ud835\udcb3_obs^m := { x\u2208\u211d^d: A_obs,m  x \u2264 b_obs,m}  for m\u2208 [M]. We assume the target region is also defined as \npolyhedral region \ud835\udcb3_tar := { x\u2208\u211d^d: a_tar,n^\u22a4 x \u2264 b_tar,n, n \u2208 [N]}. Fig.\u00a0<ref> shows a sample environment with L=4, M=2, and N=4.  \n\n\n\n\nWe define the % confidence ellipse for a Gaussian distribution x\u223c\ud835\udca9(x_i,P_i) as \u2130_\u03c7(x_i,P_i) := {x\u2208\u211d^d: (x-x_i)^\u22a4 P^-1(x-x_i) \u2264\u03c7^2()}, where \u03c7^2() is the -th quantile of the Chi-squared distribution. For simplicity, we use \u03c7^2 in the sequel. Fig.\u00a0<ref> depicts a sample belief path with 6 steps using confidence ellipses, where two measurements are performed at time-steps k=3 and 6 with no measurement at all other time-steps k (which means S_k=0 for k\u2209{1,3}).\n\n\nFor a fixed confidence level \u03c7^2>0,\nwe say a belief state (x_i,P_i) is collision-free if the confidence ellipse \u2130_\u03c7(x_i,P_i) has empty overlap with obstacles \ud835\udcb3_obs^m for all m\u2208 [M] and is contained in \ud835\udcb3_dom. The collision-free constraint can be written as \n\n\n\n    x_obs\u2209\u2130_\u03c7(x_i, P_i),   \u2200 x_obs\u2208\ud835\udcb3^m_obs,   m\u2208 M,\n       \u2130_\u03c7(x_i,P_i) \u2286\ud835\udcb3_dom.\n\n\n\nAt first glance, (<ref>) and (<ref>) seem to have two seperate mathematical forms. However, (<ref>) can be written as\n\n    x_out\u2209\u2130_\u03c7(x_i,P_i),  \u2200 x_out\u2208\ud835\udcb3_out,\n\nwhere \ud835\udcb3_out := \u211d^d \\\ud835\udcb3_dom. We can rewrite \ud835\udcb3_out as the union of half-space (1-faced polyhedral) obstacles \ud835\udcb3_out^l={x\u2208\u211d^d: -a_dom,l^\u22a4 x \u2264 -b_dom,l} for l \u2208 [L]. Hence, (<ref>) and (<ref>) can be jointly written as\nx_o\u2209\u2130_\u03c7(x_i, P_i),   \u2200 x_o\u2208\ud835\udcb3^j_O,   j\u2208 [J:=M+L],\n\n\n\nwhere \ud835\udcb3^j_O\u2208{\ud835\udcb3^1_obs, \u2026, \ud835\udcb3^M_obs, \ud835\udcb3^1_out, \u2026, \ud835\udcb3^L_out}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a fixed confidence level  \u03c7^2>0, we say belief state (x_i,P_i) is an admissible final state if \u2130_\u03c7(x_i,P_i) is contained in \ud835\udcb3_tar (i.e., \u2130_\u03c7(x_i,P_i) \u2286\ud835\udcb3_tar). For instance, \u2130_\u03c7(x_6,P_6) in Fig.\u00a0<ref> is an admissible final belief state.\n\n\nSimilar to \ud835\udcb3_out,  region \ud835\udcb3_tout:= \u211d^d\\\ud835\udcb3_tar can be thought as the union of half-space obstacles  \ud835\udcb3_tout^n={x\u2208\u211d^d: -a_n^\u22a4 x \u2264 -b_n} for n\u2208 [N]. Thus,  \u2130_\u03c7(x_i,P_i) is an admissible final state iff x_tout\u2209\u2130_\u03c7(x_i,P_i), \u2200 x_tout\u2208\ud835\udcb3^n_tout,  \u2200 n\u2208 [N].\n\n\n\n\n\nGoverned by dynamics (<ref>), it is easy to verify that the state of the robot in transition t_k-1\u2192 t_k can be parameterized by s \u2208 int as (x_k[s]= x_k-1+ s \u0394 x_k ,P[s] = P_k-1+ s W ), where \u0394 x_k:= x_k-x_k-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a fixed confidence level \u03c7^2>0, we say that the transition from x_k-1 to x_k with initial covariance P_k-1 is collision-free if for all s \u2208 int, \u2130_\u03c7(x[s],P[s]) has empty overlap with obstacles \ud835\udcb3_obs^m for all m\u2208[M], and \ud835\udcb3_out. Mathematically, it is equivalent to x_o\u2209\u2130_\u03c7(x_k[s], P_k[s]),  \u2200 x_o\u2208\ud835\udcb3^j_O,   j\u2208 [J], \u2200 s\u2208 int.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PROBLEM FORMULATION\n\n\nLet's fix the number of time steps K and confidence level \u03c7^2. Introducing information matrix Q_k:=(P_k-1+W)^-1= P_k^-1-S_k, the shortest path problem with respect to the proposed steering cost can be formulated as\n\n\n\n\n\n    min     \u2211_k=1^K(x_k-x_k-1^2+\u03b1/2log (Q_k+S_k)\n             -\u03b1/2log Q_k) \n    s.t.     Q_k^-1 = (Q_k-1+S_k-1)^-1+W,  \u2200 k \u2208 [K],\n        x_o\u2209\u2130_\u03c7(x_k[s],(Q_k+S_k)^-1[s]),\n       \u2200 k\u2208 [K], \u2200 x_o\u2208\ud835\udcb3^j_O,  \u2200 j\u2208 [J], \u2200 s \u2208 int\n       x_tout\u2209\u2130_\u03c7(x_K,(Q_K+S_K)^-1),\n       \u2200 x_tout\u2208\ud835\udcb3^n_tout,  \u2200 n\u2208 [N],\n\n where the minimization is performed over {x_k, Q_k, S_k}_k=1^K, and  x_0 and Q_0+S_0 := P_0^-1 are given.\nConstraint (<ref>) is the Kalman filter iteration, (<ref>) states all transitions t_k-1\u2192 t_k are safe (collision-free), and  (<ref>) ensures that final belief is an admissible final state.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We can define a relaxation of problem (<ref>) via\n \n\n\n\n\n    min     (<ref>)\n    s.t.       Q_k^-1\u227d (Q_k-1+S_k-1)^-1+W,  \u2200 k \u2208 [K],\n       (<ref>) and (<ref>).\n\n\n\nThe following lemma proves that the optimal solution of Problem (<ref>)  is also an optimal solution of Problem (<ref>). Solving problem (<ref>) has computational advantage over solving problem (<ref>), as constraint  (<ref>) is convex whereas (<ref>) is not. More precisely, (<ref>) can be written as a linear matrix inequality (LMI)    \n\n\n\n    [         Q_k         Q_k        Q_kW;         Q_k Q_k-1+S_k-1           0;       W Q_k           0           W ]\u227d 0, \u2200 k \u2208 [K].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proof is based on contradiction. Assume the optimal value of Problem (<ref>) is  attained by (x^*_k, Q^*_k, S^*_k) as J^*,  where (<ref>) does not hold. We consider the set  (x^*_k, Q^**_k, S^*_k), where\n\n\n\n    Q_k^**-1 = (Q_k-1^**+S^*_k-1)^-1+W,  \u2200 k\u2208 [K],\n\nstarting again from Q_0^**+S^*_0=P_0^-1,\nand show  (x^*_k, Q^**_k, S^*_k) is a feasible solution to Problem (<ref>) that attains a lower value J^**\u2264 J^*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Q_k^**   \u227dQ_k^*.\n\n\n\nWe proceed via induction on k. For k=1, we have Q_1^**-1 = Q_1^*-1 = P_0 + W, and thus the base step \nholds. We now assume (<ref>) holds for k=t and show (<ref>) holds for k=t+1. From Q_t^**\u227dQ_t^*, it immediately follows that\nQ_t+1^**-1 = (Q_t^**+S^*_t)^-1 + W \u227c  (Q_t^*+S_t^*)^-1 + W \u227cQ_t+1^*-1,\n\n\n\n\nwhich establishes the claim for k=t+1.\n\n\nClaim\u00a01 implies that \u2130_\u03c7(x^*_k[s], (Q_k^**+S_k^*)^-1[s]) \u2286\u2130_\u03c7(x^*_k[s], (Q_k^*+S^*_k)^-1[s]) and  \u2130_\u03c7(x^*_K,(Q\u0302_K^**+S^*_K)^-1) \u2286\u2130_\u03c7(x^*_K,(Q\u0302_K^*+S^*_K)^-1), which proves (x^*_k, Q^**_k, S^*_k) satisfies constraints (<ref>), and (<ref>). Constraint (<ref>) is also satisfied trivially which leads to the conclusion that (x^*_k, Q^**_k, S^*_k) is a feasible solution for (<ref>). On the other hand, using the matrix determinant lemma we have\n\n\n\n    log (Q_k+S_k) - log Q_k\n       = log S_k+ log(Q_k^-1+S_k^-1).\n\nIt is trivial to see (<ref>) is decreasing function of Q_k, which proves J^**\u2264 J^*.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth constraints  (<ref>), and (<ref>) have to be held over a continuous domain (like \u2200 x_o\u2208\ud835\udcb3_O^j), which cannot be handled directly by standard gradient-based solvers. In the upcoming subsections, we derive equivalent conditions for these constraints using strong duality and the theorem of alternatives <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Discrete-time Collision Constraint\n\n\nThe ellipse \u2130_\u03c7(x_i,Q_i^-1) and the f-faced polyhedron \ud835\udcb3={ x: A x\u2264 b}  do not overlap if and only if \u2203\u03bb\u2265 0_f such that\n\n    -\u03bb^\u22a4 A Q_i^-1 A^\u22a4\u03bb + 2 \u03bb^\u22a4 (A x_i- b) \u2265\u03c7^2.\n\n\n\n\nInvoking the definition of confidence ellipse, the absence of overlap between \u2130_\u03c7(x_i,Q_i^-1) and \ud835\udcb3 can be written as \n\n\n\n    \u2200 x \u2208\ud835\udcb3,     (x-x_i)^\u22a4 Q_i (x-x_i) \u2265\u03c7^2,\n\nwhich is equivalent to the condition that the minimum value \n\n    V^* \u225cmin_x:Ax\u2264 b  (1/2)(x-x_i)^\u22a4 Q_i (x-x_i)\n\nis greater than \u03c7^2/2. It is straightforward to see that the dual of (<ref>) is \n\n\n\n    max_\u03bb\u2265 0 -(1/2) \u03bb^\u22a4 A Q_i^-1 A^\u22a4\u03bb+ \u03bb ^\u22a4 (A x_i - b),\n\nwhere \u03bb\u2265 0_f is the dual variable. The optimization problem (<ref>) is convex in x for a given pair of (x_i,P_i), and it is easy to verify that Slater's condition holds. Therefore, strong duality holds, implying that V^* \u2265\u03c7^2/2 if and only if there exists a dual feasible solution (\u03bb\u2265 0_f) satisfying (<ref>).  \n\n\n\n\nIf the polyhedron \ud835\udcb3 is a half-space {x: a^\u22a4 x \u2264 b},\n (<ref>) simplifies to - (a^\u22a4 Q_i^-1 a) \u03bb^2 + 2(a^\u22a4 x_i- b) \u03bb -\u03c7^2 \u2265 0,\nwhich is a second order function of scalar \u03bb. It is easy to verify that the maximum of (a^\u22a4 x_i-b)^2/a^\u22a4 Q_i^-1 a-\u03c7^2 is obtained at \u03bb=a^\u22a4 x_i-b/a^\u22a4 Q^-1a\u2265 0. Hence, (<ref>) reduces to \n\n\n\n    a^\u22a4 x_i+ \u221a(\u03c7^2 a^\u22a4  Q_i^-1 a)\u2264 b.\n\n\n\nEquation (<ref>) was previously derived in <cit.> and is extensively used in CC planners.

However, \n(<ref>) is stronger than the condition implying that initial and final confidence ellipses in transition t_k-1\u2192 t_k are separately collision-free because  (<ref>) and (<ref>) should be satisfied for a common \u03bb.  \n\n\nConstraint (<ref>) has a general non-convex form.

These non-convex terms are negative of convex functions, meaning that (<ref>) is a DOC problem.\n\n\n\nA variety of  sequential quadratic programming (SQP)-based\napproaches <cit.> could be used to solve the nonlinear program (<ref>) to local optimality. However, it would be required to  artificially assume that the sequence of convex programs in the SQP solvers stay feasible. In contrast, if we apply CCP to a DOC problem like (<ref>),  the concavity of the non-convex terms guarantees that the sequence of convex programs is feasible <cit.>. Also, it is shown that CCP monotonically converges to a local optimum <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Convex-Concave Procedure (CCP)\n\nCCP is an iterative method that starts from a feasible solution of a DOC optimization program. It over-approximates concave terms (both in the objective function and constraints) in the program via affine functions obtained by linearization around a feasible solution. The resulting convex problem can then be solved using standard convex solvers. The linearization is then repeated around the obtained solution, and the iteration continues until the sequence of solutions converges to a locally optimal solution <cit.>. \n\n\n\nTo implement CCP for (<ref>), we can linearize the functions  h_3(Q,S)\u225clog (Q+S)-log Q and h_2(R,x,\u03bb) around  a feasible solution (Q\u0303,S\u0303, x\u0303, \u03bb\u0303) by h\u0305_3(Q,S: Q\u0303,S\u0303) = log(Q\u0303+S\u0303)-log Q+ ((Q\u0303+S\u0303)^-1 (Q+S- Q\u0303-S\u0303)), and h\u0305_2(R, x,\u03bb: x\u0303,\u03bb\u0303) = R+\u03c7^2+A x_k-b^2+\u03bb^2 -\nAx\u0303-b+\u03bb\u0303^2 - 2\n    (Ax\u0303-b+\u03bb\u0303)^\u22a4 (A(x-x\u0303)+\u03bb-\u03bb\u0303), respectively.\nDenoting the the solution obtained via the  CCP iteration i as {x_k^i, S_k^i, Q^i_k}_k=1^K and {\u03bb_k,j^i}_k=1,j=1^K,J, at iteration i+1 we solve the convex problem\n\n\n\n\n\n    min     \u2211_k=1^Kx_k-x_k-1^2  +\u03b1/2h\u0305_3(Q_k,S_k:Q^i_k,S^i_k)\n    \n        \n        \n         s.t.

We derived a novel safety constraint to bound the probability of collision with polyhedral obstacles in the transition between two Gaussian belief states. We deployed the presented safety constraint to formulate minimum sensing path planning as an optimization problem. We formulated this problem as a DOC program, for which the CCP algorithm can be utilized to find local optima. We proposed to use such a CCP algorithm as an efficient smoothing algorithm.\n\nNumerical simulations demonstrated the utility of the proposed algorithm.\n\nThis paper assumes a fixed (common) confidence level for all\ntransitions on the path, and it is silent about the end-to-end\nprobability of collision. One future direction is to develop a\nsmoothing mechanism that allows the allocation of (potentially) different confidence\nlevels to each transition subject to a constraint on the end-to-end collision probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PROOF OF THEOREM\u00a0<REF> \n \nWe provide the proof for d=2; however, the proof can be generalized for arbitrary dimension. \nIf we denote the elements of x as x= [q_1  q_2]^\u22a4, feasibility problem (<ref>) becomes\n\n\n\n\n\n    min_s\u2265 0,  q_1, q_2      0\n    s.t.      \n    R_0 +R_1 q_1+R_2 q_2+ R_3s\u227b 0,\n        s \u2264 1,     A_1 q_1 + A_2 q_2 \u2264 b,\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n    R_0=[     \u03c7^2 x_k-1^\u22a4;   x_k-1   P_k-1 ],    \n        R_1=[  0 -1  0; -1  0  0;  0  0  0 ],\n        R_2=[  0  0 -1;  0  0  0; -1  0  0 ], \n           R_3=[       0 \u0394 x_k^\u22a4;   \u0394 x_k       W ],\n\nand A_1 and A_2 are the first and the second columns of A, respectively. The\nLagrangian of problem (<ref>), can be written as \u2112(q_1,q_2,s, M, \u03b3, \u03bb) = (-(R_0 +R_1 q_1+R_2 q_2+ R_3 s) M)+ \u03b3 (s-1) +\u03bb^\u22a4(A_1 q_1 + A_2 q_2- b), where M\u227d0, \u03b3\u22650, and \u03bb\u2265 0 are dual variables. Dual function for (<ref>) can be written as\ng(M, \u03b3, \u03bb) = -(R_0M)-\u03bb^\u22a4 b-\u03b3+ inf_q_1 (-(R_1M)+\u03bb^\u22a4 A_1)   q_1 + inf_q_2 (-(R_2M)+\u03bb^\u22a4 A_2)  q_2+ inf_s\u22650(-(R_3M)+\u03b3) s. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHence, the dual problem of (<ref>) can be written as\n\n\n\n\n\n    max      -(R_0M)-\u03bb^\u22a4 b-\u03b3\n    s.t.       -(R_1M)+\u03bb^\u22a4 A_1=0,\n         -(R_2M)+\u03bb^\u22a4 A_2=0,\n       -(R_3M)+\u03b3\u2265 0.\n\n\n where variables are M\u227d 0, \u03b3\u2265 0, and \u03bb\u2265 0. If we denote the element at the ith row and the jth column of M by m_i,j, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nconstraints (<ref>) and (<ref>) yield [m_1,2  m_1,3] = -1/2\u03bb^\u22a4 A.

Thus, (<ref>) is unbounded iff it admits a feasible solution (M_1>0,  M_2\u227d 0, \u03bb\u22650,) that yields a positive value of objective function. From the theorem of alternatives, we know unboundedness of dual problem implies the infeasibility of primal problem and vice versa.
