We find that traditional kilonova and supernova models do not match well the properties of the optical excess, leaving us with the intriguing suggestion that this event was an exotic high-energy merger. \n\n\n\n\n\n(stars:) gamma-ray burst: individual: GRB 210704A \u2013 (transients:) gamma-ray bursts\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the brightest explosive events in the universe <cit.>. They are classified according to their duration T_90 and spectral hardness <cit.>. The population of short GRBs (SGRBs) typically has T_90\u2272 2 s and harder spectra, whereas the population of long GRBs (LGRBs) typically has T_90\u2273 2 s and softer spectra <cit.>. However, there is overlap between the two populations, and so in some cases it is not clear whether a burst with intermediate properties belongs to the one population or the other <cit.>.\n\nNowadays, it is known that at least some SGRBs are the consequence of mergers between compact objects, driven by angular momentum and energy losses to gravitational radiation <cit.> and as such are sources of gravitational wave emission <cit.>. These mergers are followed by a luminous and short-lived kilonova emission, visible at optical and near-infrared wavelengths <cit.>.\n\nIn contrast, LGRBs are thought to be the result of the core-collapse of a star <cit.> whose mass exceeds about 10 M_\u2299 <cit.>.  \nIn this scenario, the optical emission from the SN appears a few days after the GRB, when the afterglow has faded sufficiently and the component powered by radioactive heating can be seen. This leads to two ways to identify the presence of a SN associated with a LGRB. First, through a \u201crebrightening\u201d or \u201cexcess\u201d in the optical /nIR light curve of the LGRB, visible for several days/weeks after the burst as a consequence of the SN emission <cit.>. \nSecond, by the appearance of the broad spectral lines characteristic of rapidly expanding ejecta.\nThe identification of a SN associated with GRB 980425  <cit.> and of several more in the following years (see, e.g., ) confirmed that this scenario applies to most LGRBs. \n\nIn this work, we investigate the nature of GRB 210704A, a burst first classified as a SGRB, but later considered to be of intermediate duration. We study the high-energy properties of the GRB prompt phase, and present  X-ray, optical, and infrared observations of its afterglow to 15 days after the burst. These observations show that the afterglow initially fades but then becomes brighter again in the optical and, to a less extent, in the near-infrared.  We also present late HST observations of a possible host galaxy. We derive constraints on the redshift of the bursts and consider three possible host environments: a nearby galaxy, a nearby cluster of galaxies, and a distant galaxy. We explore different scenarios to explain our data, and eliminate all of the those involving standard SGRBs or LGRBs. We are left with the intriguing possibility that GRB 210704A was an exotic transient in a cluster at z\u2248 0.2.\n\nOur paper is organised as follows. In section\u00a0<ref>, we present the observations with Fermi, Swift, Chandra, GTC, LDT, Gemini, Subaru, HST, and other telescopes. In section\u00a0<ref> we present our analysis. We discuss the nature of the GRB in section\u00a0<ref>. Finally, in section\u00a0<ref> we summarise our results. \n\n\n\n\u00a7 OBSERVATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Gamma-rays\n\n\nThe prompt gamma-ray emission of GRB\u00a0210704A was detected by six instruments: Fermi/GBM <cit.>, AGILE/MCAL <cit.>, Fermi/LAT <cit.>,  AstroSat/CZTI <cit.>, Konus-Wind <cit.>, INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, and INTEGRAL/ISGRI <cit.>.\nHereafter, we use the Fermi/GBM trigger time as reference time  T = 2021 July 4 19:33:24.59 UTC. \n\n<cit.> estimated a duration of about T_90 = 1.06\u00a0s based on the  AGILE/MCAL data (0.4-100\u00a0MeV), and classified it as a SGRB. \nA similar short duration, T_90 = 1.0\u00b1 0.4\u00a0s (20-200 keV), was derived by the analysis of the AstroSat/CZTI dataset <cit.>. \n\n\n<cit.> reported instead that the Fermi/GBM light curve consisted of a main bright peak with a duration T_90 of about 4.7\u00a0s (50-300\u00a0keV), with possible faint emission extending to T+20\u00a0s <cit.>. \nIn the time interval between T and T+10\u00a0s, high-energy (>100\u00a0MeV) emission was detected by the Fermi/LAT <cit.> with a photon flux of (1.6\u00b10.3)\u00d710^-3 ph cm^-2 s^-1 and a photon index of -1.74\u00b10.13. \nThe LAT localization was RA, Dec (J2000) = 159.08, +57.31 with a 90% error radius of 6.7 arcmin, critical to enable follow-up observations with narrow-field instruments.\n\n<cit.> reported Konus-Wind observations of a bright peak\nin the interval from T to T+2\u00a0s followed by a weaker pulse peaked at T+4.5\u00a0s (20\u00a0keV - 4\u00a0MeV). Finally, <cit.> estimated a duration of T_90 = 3.5\u00b1 0.7\u00a0s (>80\u00a0keV) based on the INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS data.\nAll the durations T_90 cited above are summarised in Table\u00a0<ref>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values of T_90 reported in GCNs range from 1.0 to 4.7 seconds (see Table\u00a0<ref>) and do not unambiguously aid in the classification of GRB\u00a0210704A. \nThis discrepancy can largely be understood by considering Figure\u00a0<ref>, which shows the Fermi/GBM light curves in three energy bands.\n\n\nIt shows that the observed emission in the soft energy range (8-50\u00a0keV; top panel) consists of a weak precursor, followed by strong initial peak with a duration of less than 2 seconds and then an extended tail out to about 6 seconds with two weaker peaks at about 3.5 and 4.8 seconds. \nHowever, the precursor and tail are not seen in the harder 300-1000\u00a0keV band. \nTherefore, we suggest that gamma-ray instruments that are not sensitive to soft (\u227250 keV) energies would not detect the extended emission and would measure shorter values of T_90.  \nThis sort of instrumental selection effect is well known <cit.> and can explain the short T_90 measured by AGILE/MCAL, but does not completely explain the short value measured by AstroSat/CZTI. \n\nWe conclude that from the prompt gamma-ray light curve alone it is not clear whether the GRB is a LGRB or a SGRB with temporally extended spectrally soft emission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 X-rays\n\n\n\nFollowing the localisation by the Fermi/LAT,\nthe X-Ray Telescope (XRT) aboard Swift initiated automated Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of the field <cit.>. \nA first visit was carried out between T+53.5\u00a0ks and  T+61.6\u00a0ks for a total exposure of 2.6\u00a0ks. This led to the identification of the X-ray afterglow at an enhanced position of RA, Dec (J2000) = 10:36:05.21 +57:12:59.1 with a 90% uncertainty radius of 2.7.\nMonitoring of the source continued until T + 5.3\u00a0d, when the X-ray afterglow fell below the XRT detection threshold. \n\nIn our analysis, we use light curves and spectra from the UK Swift Science Data Centre (UKSSDC) on-line repository <cit.>. \nThe XRT light curve displays a simple power-law decline, t^-\u03b1 with \u03b1=1.3\u00b10.2.\nThe time-averaged XRT spectrum, from T+53\u00a0ks to T+455\u00a0ks, is best described by an absorbed power-law with a photon index \u0393=1.7\u00b10.2 and hydrogen column density N_ H = 5.6\u00d7 10^19 cm^-2 fixed at the Galactic value. \nBased on this model, the unabsorbed X-ray flux (0.3\u201310 keV) at 11\u00a0hrs is approximately 8\u00d710^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1, in agreement with the distribution of X-ray fluxes of bright SGRBs <cit.>.\n\nIn order to characterise the afterglow temporal evolution at late times, we requested Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) observations with the Chandra X-ray Telescope. The target was observed with the ACIS-S3 camera, starting at 01:32:42 UTC on 2021 July 22 (T+14.25\u00a0d) for a total exposure of 19.8\u00a0ks (ObsID: 25093; PI: Troja). The Chandra data were processed using  4.12 with  Version 4.9.0. \nAt the afterglow position we detect 12 photons within a 1 extraction radius. \nAfter correcting for PSF-losses, we derive a count rate of (6.6^+2.1_-1.7) \u00d7 10^-4 cts s^-1 in the 0.5-7.0\u00a0keV energy range.\nThis translates to an unabsorbed X-ray flux of (1.3^+0.4_-0.3) \u00d7 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.3-10\u00a0keV energy band using the best fit parameters derived from the Swift/XRT spectrum. \nThe combined Swift/Chandra light curve is best described by a power-law decay with \u03b1=1.26\u00b10.04. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Optical and Infrared Photometry\n\n\n\n\nWe carried out an extensive campaign of follow-up observations using \nthe Deca-Degree Optical Transient Imager (DDOTI; ),\nthe Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) on the 4.3-m Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT; ), the Near Infra-red Imager (NIRI) and the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) instruments on the 8.1-m Gemini-North Telescope  <cit.>,  the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru 8.2 m telescope <cit.>, and the Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) instrument on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC; ). \nTable\u00a0<ref> gives a log of the observations. \n\nThis dataset was supplemented by archival observations from the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), and \nfrom the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam during December 2004 (PI: Tanvir and Cowie) (observationID: G013.158.521+57.697) \nand retrieved from the MegaPipe image stacking pipeline[https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/megapipe/access/graph.html]. \n\n\nData were processed following standard techniques for CCD data reduction (e.g., bias subtraction, flat-fielding, cosmic-ray rejection).  \nThe Gemini images were reduced using the Gemini  package v1.14[https://www.gemini.edu/observing/phase-iii/understanding-and-processing-data/data-processing-software/gemini-iraf-general], whereas the GTC, LDT and Subaru images were reduced using custom Python-based software. The HST data were processed using standard procedures within the  package <cit.>. The final pixel scale was 0.09/pix for WFC3/IR (F105W and F160W filters) and 0.03/pix for the WFC3/UVIS data.\n\n\n\nWe performed PSF photometry on the optical images using  <cit.>. To minimize systematic errors in the calibration, we calibrated all of the r and z photometry using the same six nearby Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12 (DR12) stars <cit.>. \nIn the nIR images from Gemini, only a weak signal is visible at the GRB position. We estimated its brightness by performing forced aperture photometry, calibrated against nearby Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS; ) sources. Due to the low number of \n2MASS sources within the NIRI field of view and their likely extended nature, a systematic error of 0.1 mag was added to the absolute calibration of the nIR photometry.  \n\nWe performed photometry of the two galaxies S1 and S2 (see Figure\u00a0<ref>) in the late-epoch HST images using using  aperture photometry and the photometric zeropoints in the image headers. We will discuss the possibility of these galaxies being the host of the GRB in <ref>, but for the time being we will simply note that S1 is almost coincident with the GRB position and therefore our ground-based observations combine the flux of both the GRB counterpart and S1.\n\nOur photometry is shown in Table\u00a0<ref> (with upper limits being 3\u03c3) and Table <ref> and is plotted in Figure\u00a0<ref>. All our magnitudes were converted to an AB scale and not corrected for Milky Way extinction, E(B-V) = 0.007 <cit.>. We also include additional measurements from the literature <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Optical Spectroscopy\n\n\nOptical spectroscopy of the afterglow at T + 1.1\u00a0d was obtained by <cit.> \n \nusing the OSIRIS instrument on GTC. We downloaded their calibrated spectrum from the GRBSpec database <cit.>, and show it in Figure\u00a0<ref>. \n\n\n\n\n<cit.> noted the clear presence of a continuum down to at least 4200\u00a0\u00c5, which implies z < 3.6. \nThey also noted a tentative detection of a broad absorption dip at about 4050\u00a0\u00c5, which they interpreted as Ly-\u03b1 at z = 2.34. We note that this feature occurs in a part of the spectrum that is quite noisy, which calls its reality into doubt.\nThey also commented on possible low-significance detections of absorption from OI (1302/1304\u00a0\u00c5), SiII (1260\u00a0\u00c5), and CII (1334\u00a0\u00c5),\nbut the absence of corresponding absorption from CIV and SiIV.\n\n\nAnother clue to the GRB redshift comes\nfrom the lack of MgII absorption features.\nThe MgII doublet was observed with a mean rest-frame equivalent width of about 3.8\u00a0\u00c5 in 27 of the sample of 31 LGRBs observed by <cit.> and <cit.>. \nThe optical spectrum of GRB210704A has a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of at least 5 from 5000 to 7200\u00a0\u00c5 and shows no strong absorption lines. For this reason, we suggest that if the GRB is similar to typical LGRBs, then the absence of MgII disfavours the redshift range \n0.8<z<1.6. However, if the GRB is similar to typical SGRBs, whose spectra do not show strong host absorption lines, then we have the weaker constraint that the redshift is less than 3.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Amati correlation\n\n\n\nGiven the ambiguity of the GRB duration, we will consider its properties in the context of the Amati correlation <cit.>. For this, we analysed the Fermi/GBM data from T-0.2 to T+6.1\u00a0s and found the best fitting function was a Band function with \u03b1=-0.59\u00b10.02, \u03b2=-2.95\u00b1 0.20, and E_ peak= 283\u00b1 8 keV. \nThe fluence in the 10-1000 keV interval (observer's frame) is F=(2.3\u00b10.3)\u00d7 10^-5 erg cm^-2.  In the top panel of Figure\u00a0<ref>, we show the position of the GRB at z = 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, and 2.34. We also show the populations of SGRBs and LGRBs from <cit.>. We see that GRB 210704A is consistent with being a SGRB at low redshift (z<0.4) or with being a LGRB at higher redshift (z \u2273 0.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Spectral lag\n\n\n\nWe also consider the spectral lag GRB 210704A in the context of other GRBs, following <cit.> and <cit.>. \n\nWe derive the GRB peak flux by fitting the spectrum of the brightest 1.024 s interval <cit.>  with a Band function.\nThe best fit model yields \u03b1=-0.36\u00b1 0.02, \u03b2=-2.82\u00b1 0.12, E_ peak= 302\u00b1 8 keV), and a peak flux of F=(1.53\u00b1 0.02)\u00d7 10^-5 erg cm^-2 s^-1. \nFrom this value, we derive the isotropic-equivalent peak luminosity,\n L_ peak, by assuming different redshifts.\n For example, at z=0.5 the measured peak flux corresponds to L_ peak  = (5.46 \u00b1 0.07)\u00d7 10^51 erg s^-1 in the comoving 50\u2013300\u00a0keV energy range.\n\nWe calculated the lag between the energy bands 25\u201350 keV and 100\u2013300 keV using the 10 ms resolution light curve and the sum of the signals from the three brightest Fermi NaI detectors (1, 3 and 5). \nThe lag was determined by the maximum of the cross-correlation function between the two light curves. We fit a 4th-degree polynomial around the peak in order to accurately determine the lag. We find that the lag is:\n\u03c4 = 80\u00b1 9\u00a0 ms,\nin which the uncertainties are 1\u03c3.\nWe estimated the uncertainty by adding Poisson noise to the data <cit.> and repeating the cross-correlation analysis. \n\n\nIn the bottom panel of Figure\u00a0<ref>, we show the spectral lag (corrected for redshift as (1+z)^0.67, following ) and peak luminosity L_ peak of the GRB at z=0.1, 0.4, 0.8, and 2.34. We also show the populations of LGRBs and SGRBs from <cit.> and <cit.>. \nWe see that, for any redshift, the GRB lag is longer than typical SGRBs.\nIts luminosity fits within the distribution\nof cosmological LGRBs for z \u2273 0.8, whereas for lower redshifts its location in the lag-luminosity diagram would be unusual. \nOther outliers in a similar position are \nGRB\u00a0031203 and GRB\u00a0060729A, peculiar LGRBs associated with bright supernovae. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Afterglow\n\n\n\nIn the standard fireball model for GRBs, the afterglow emission is produced by external shocks resulting from the interaction between the relativistic jet and the circumstellar medium <cit.>. \nTypically, the afterglow phase can be explained as synchrotron radiation from a power-law energy distribution of shocked electrons, N(E)\u221d E^-p, which lead to the observed flux density being a series of power-laws segments as a function of time t and frequency \u03bd as F_\u03bd\u221d t^-\u03b1\u03bd^-\u03b2 <cit.> in which F_\u03bd is the observed flux density and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the temporal and spectral indices, respectively. \n\nThe early optical and X-ray data can be fit with a with a simple absorbed power-law of slope \u03b2=0.84\u00b10.02 (see Figure\u00a0<ref>), indicating that they belong to the same spectral segment and therefore they are expected to display the same temporal decay. \nWe identify this segment as \u03bd_m\u2272\u03bd_opt\u2272\u03bd_X\u2272\u03bd_c (and therefore a slow-cooling regime), where \u03bd_m is the synchrotron characteristic frequency and \u03bd_c is the cooling frequency <cit.>. \nIn this case, F_\u03bd\u221d\u03bd^(1-p)/2 and the electron index is p=2.68\u00b10.04.\nFor a fireball expanding into a uniform density medium, the relation of flux density and time is F_\u03bd\u221d t^3(1-p)/4. With the electron index previously estimated, we obtain F_\u03bd\u221d t^-1.26\u00b10.03.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple power-law decay of slope -1.26 is consistent with X-ray observations at all epochs and with the early optical observations (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). However, beginning at T+5.5\u00a0d, it underpredicts the observed optical and near-infrared emission. \nWe interpret this as evidence of an additional component powering the late-time optical/nIR light curve and will return to discuss it in detail in <ref>.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the condition that the X-ray afterglow is in slow-cooling regime, we derive an upper limit on the circumburst density n following <cit.>: \n\n    n \u2272  0.4    (1+z/ 2)^-6/11(t/ 1\u00a0d)^-4/11(E_ K,iso/10^52\u00a0erg)^-6/11\n       (\u03f5_e/0.1)^-40/33(\u03f5_B/10^-5)^-5/9\u00a0cm^-3,\n\nwhich is consistent with densities typical of the interstellar medium, and disfavors the high-density environment where some LGRBs are found.\n\nFinally, by assuming that the GeV flux is also produced by external forward shocks, \nwe can use the flux above 100\u00a0MeV <cit.> as proxy for the blastwave kinetic energy <cit.>. For p\u22482.6, we obtain: \n\n    E_ K,iso\u2248   \u00a0  10^53(1+z/3)^-1(d_L,28/5)^1.74(F_LAT/ 0.2\u00a0nJy)^0.87(t/ 5\u00a0s)^1.25\n       (\u03f5_e/0.1)^-1.38(\u03f5_B/10^-3)^0.13\u00a0erg,\n\nwhere d_L,28 is the luminosity distance in units of 10^28\u00a0cm.\nFor z\u22732, this value fits well within the distribution of LGRBs. \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Late-time Excess\n\n\n\nThe light curves in Figure\u00a0<ref> are compared to the standard power-law afterglow.  A late-time flattening is expected due to the contribution of the source S1, underlying the GRB position. This model (solid lines) underpredicts the optical and, to a less extent, near-infrared photometry from T+5\u00a0d to T+15\u00a0d. We consider this to be indicative of an excess component in addition to the afterglow. We identify the peak of this excess at around T+6.5\u00a0d, when the observed light is 3-5 times brighter than the afterglow+S1 model. \n\nFigure\u00a0<ref> shows the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the GRB counterpart at \ntwo epochs, T+1.1\u00a0d and  T+5.5\u00a0d, respectively. \nThe earlier SED is well described by a power-law function, as expected for a non-thermal afterglow spectrum.\nThe later SED shows an excess in the optical (grz) and J band. \n\n\nWe consider a simple model for the excess, treating it as black-body emission arising from a spherical fireball in expansion and ignoring relativistic effects. The rest-frame parameters of this model are the temperature T' and radius R' of the photosphere. \n\nIn the observer's frame, the spectrum will have the shape of a black-body with T_ obs = T'/(1+z).\n\nIf we fit this simple black-body model to the grzJK data in Figure\u00a0<ref>, we obtain T_ obs\u2248 3800\u00a0K (orange thin line) and a reduced \u03c7^2 \u2248 2 as this model severely underpredicts the K-band measurement. \nThis discrepancy could be due the presence of broad line spectral features that either suppress the K-band emission or enhance the zJ-band measurements. \nIn the latter case, if we exclude the zJ-band points from the fit, the continuum is \nwell described by a hotter black-body with T_ obs\u2248 9000\u00a0K (blue thick line). \nWe examine both these models in more detail when we discuss likely progenitors and redshifts in <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe field of GRB\u00a0210704A  is shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. \nThe GRB region shows an overdensity of low-redshift galaxies, notably\nthe galaxy WISEA J103604.24+571327.7 (labelled G1 in Figure\u00a0<ref>) at z = 0.0817 and the galaxies' cluster 400d J1036+5713 at z = 0.203 <cit.>. \nTwo faint (r\u224825 AB mag) sources (labelled S1 and S2 in Figure\u00a0<ref>) lie closer to the GRB position and are also plausible candidate host galaxies. \n\nUnfortunately, optical spectroscopy does not allow us to conclusively determine the redshift of GRB 210704A and use this redshift to determine the host galaxy (see \u00a0<ref>). Therefore, we analyse the projected angular offsets between the galaxies and the GRB to quantify the probability of association.\n\n\nWe determined the positions, statistical uncertainties, and half-light radii using the pre-explosion r-band image from MegaPrime/MegaCam for S1 and S2, and the Gemini/GMOS-N r-band image obtained at T+10.44\u00a0d for the GRB afterglow and the other host candidates. We likewise confirm the offsets with the HST imaging and derive the photometry for these galaxies in the HST filters (see Table\u00a0<ref>). To determine the offset for each galaxy we followed the methods outlined by <cit.>. \nWe first aligned the afterglow image (Gemini) and pre-explosion image (MegaPrime) using  to identify point sources in each image and then  to determine the astrometric solution. Using 19 common point sources between the two images, we derive a relative astrometric uncertainty of \u03c3_tie \u223c 0.09. This astrometric uncertainty is included in the offset determination. \n\n\nUsing the Equations 1 to 3 from <cit.> and the galaxy number counts from deep optical imaging <cit.>, the probability of finding an unrelated galaxy of magnitude m_r or brighter within the vicinity of a GRB can be approximated as:\n\n    P_ ch =1-exp(-\u03c0 r^2_ i\u00d7 10^a (m_r - m_0) + b  ),\n\nwith a=0.36, b = -2.42, and m_0=24 for galaxies fainter than m_r\u227319\u00a0mag\nand a=0.56, b = -4.80 and m_0=18 for brighter galaxies. \nThe effective radius  r_ i depends on the projected angular separation R_0 between the GRB and the galaxy and on the half-light radius R_half of the galaxy. We take r_ i=2R_ half for S1 since GRB 210704A is localized inside the detectable light, whereas for other candidates we use r_ i=(R^2_ 0+4R^2_ half)^1/2 because the GRB position is well outside the light of these galaxies. In Table\u00a0<ref>, we summarize the information on the galaxies that have P_ ch<0.15.\n\n\nOften a galaxy is more likely to be the host than all the other ones, however, in the crowded field of GRB 210704A, two galaxies have comparably low probabilities of chance alignment with the GRB. \nThe bright nearby galaxy G1, located  about 29from the afterglow, has a low chance coincidence probability of 0.5%.  However, the faint galaxy S1, detected close to the afterglow position, has \na similarly  probability of 2%. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The Properties of the Possible Host Galaxy G1\n\n\nAccording to the spectrum  from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, the galaxy G1 shows the signature of Ca H and K (at 3934\u00a0\u00c5 and 3969\u00a0\u00c5 respectively), the G-band (4304\u00a0\u00c5), Mg (5175\u00a0\u00c5) and Na (5894\u00a0\u00c5) absorption lines, all of which are consistent with an old population. Moreover, the decomposition of stellar populations and their analysis using pyPipe3D[<http://ifs.astroscu.unam.mx/pyPipe3D/>], suggest of an old dominant population. Nevertheless, the analysis confirms that a young population is also present, with about 15% of the light corresponding to stars of less than 2\u00a0Gyr of age. \nBased on its spectral properties and observed morphology, we classify G1 as a Sa/Sb galaxy. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The Properties of the Possible Host Galaxy S1\n\n\nWe do not have a spectroscopic redshift for S1. Therefore, we modelled its SED (Table <ref>) using  <cit.> using the methodology previously described in <cit.>. The model parameters are the redshift z, total mass M, galaxy age t_ age, e-folding timescale \u03c4, extinction A_V, and metallicity Z. We use these parameters to derive the stellar mass M_* and the star formation rate (SFR) as outlined in <cit.>. Following <cit.>, we apply uniform priors in log t_ age, log \u03c4, log Z, and A_V. We leave the redshift as a free parameter with a uniform prior between 0 and 5. We performed a fit to the data using the  package <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\nWe obtain a photometric redshift z_phot=2.15\u00b10.10, driven by the flux increase in the \nF160W filter interpreted as the 4000 \u00c5\u00a0break\n(see Figure <ref>). \nThe best fit yields a galaxy's stellar mass M_*=(1-3)\u00d7 10^9 M_\u2299, a sub-solar metallicity Z/Z_\u2299=0.3^+0.4_-0.2, a moderate star formation rate SFR=2.5^+1.7_-0.9 M_\u2299 yr^-1, a relatively young stellar population with age t_m=0.8\u00b10.5 Gyr, and an intrinsic extinction of A_V=0.30\u00b10.15 mag. \nThese parameters are typical of GRB host galaxies in this redshift range for both long and short GRBs <cit.>, although the low metallicity tends to favor the former class. \nMoreover, the galaxy's absolute magnitude of M_ r=-21.0 is similar to other host galaxies associated to LGRBs <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 A Possible Host Cluster\n\n\nThe overdensity of galaxies\nin this vicinity of the burst is related to the X-ray cluster 400d J1036+5713 (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). \nThe cluster has an estimated mass of approximately 9\u00d710^13\u00a0\u00a0and a virial radius of R_500\u22483. As shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>, the GRB afterglow lies about 1.5\u00a0from the peak of the X-ray diffuse emission, within the cluster's angular radius. \nIn this case, the probabilities reported in Table\u00a02 might overestimate the chance of a random alignment between the GRB and the galaxies in the cluster. \nTo better estimate this value we consider the Swift XRT Cluster Survey <cit.> and search for the number of X-ray clusters serendipitously located within 2 arcmin of a GRB position. Among over 300 long GRB fields examined in the survey, only 4 closely intercept an X-ray cluster, from which we derive a chance probability of P_ ch\u22480.012, comparable to the probabilities derived for S1 and G1. \nIf we factor in the cluster brightness and consider only sources with f_X \u22732 \u00d7 10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1, then the probability of a chance alignment drops to 10^-3. A spurious GRB/cluster association is therefore unlikely, although not impossible when considering the large sample of more than 1500 Swift bursts. Notably, the only other known case of an association with an X-ray cluster is the short GRB\u00a0050509B <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISCUSSION\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we interpret and discuss the physical implications of the results obtained in section\u00a0<ref>. We consider the nature of the burst (SGRB or LGRB), its redshift, and its likely environment (G1, S1 or the galaxy cluster). For distances, we assume a \u039bCDM model with a H_0=67.8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 A nearby short GRB\n\n\n\nWe first consider the possibility of a GRB hosted by the bright (M_r\u2248-21.5) galaxy G1 (WISEA J103604.24+571327.7) at z = 0.08168. This is supported by the low probability of coincidence of only 0.5% (see Table\u00a0<ref>). \n\n\n\n\nThe relatively large projected offset of about 52\u00a0kpc from G1 is an important constraint. \nThe observed distribution for LGRBs does not extend beyond 10\u00a0kpc <cit.>, which allows us to disfavour this possibility. Furthermore, the high-energy properties of GRB\u00a0210704A do not resemble those of nearby LGRBs <cit.>. \n\nThe case for a SGRB is less clear. Between 5% and 25% of SGRBs are observed to lie beyond 20\u00a0kpc from their host galaxies <cit.>. Assuming an age of 1\u20130.1\u00a0Gyr for the GRB progenitor, the inferred offset would require an intrinsic kick velocity of v_ kick\u224850\u2013500 km s^-1, in the range observed for Galactic NS binaries.\nA SGRB at z \u223c 0.08 would be consistent with the properties of other cosmological SGRBs (section\u00a0<ref>), and would not obey the spectral lag-luminosity relation of LGRBs (section\u00a0<ref>) as observed in the case of other nearby events <cit.>. \nTherefore, based on the GRB high-energy properties and its location, a nearby SGRB remains a plausible option. \n\n\nOn the other hand, the observed peak luminosity and peak time of the excess emission do not match well the properties of the kilonova AT2017gfo: \nthe peak brightness  would be about two magnitudes fainter (M_r=-14.6) than AT2017gfo (M_r=-16.4), and the peak time would be several days later.  It was no later than T+12\u00a0hours for AT2017gfo whereas for GRB 210704A we observe a maximum around T+7\u00a0days.\n\nUsing the one-zone model of <cit.>, a radioactively powered transient peaks at a time t_peak given by \n\n\n    t_peak\u2248 1.5\u00a0 d\u00a0(M_ej/0.01 M_\u2299)^0.5(\u03ba/1 cm^2 g^-1)^0.5(v_ej/0.1 c)^-0.5\n\nwhere M_ ej is the ejecta mass,  \nv_ ej its velocity, and \u03ba its opacity. \nTo explain a peak of about 7\u00a0days, one needs to either increase the mass to of order 0.1 and/or increase the opacity. As a result, the spectral peak would shift to redder wavelengths than the ones observed in this case. \nAlternatively, a delayed peak can be explained by a low expansion velocity, v\u22480.01 c. This latter solution\nis consistent with the simple blackbody model for the optical/nIR excess, which, at a redshift of 0.08, implies temperatures of 4000-10000\u00a0K and expansion velocities of 20000-2000 km s^-1, slower than typical merger ejecta.\n\nWe also compared our case to the library of simulated kilonova light curves  by <cit.>, incorporating a broad range of ejecta compositions, morphologies and viewing angles. \nWe find that, although the luminosities of the kilonova models are in agreement with the observations for z \u2272 0.4,  the optical peak can only range from a few hours up to a couple of days after the explosion, whereas we observe a peak at T+7\u00a0d.\nWe note that the mismatch between the observed peak and the kilonova timescale applies to any SGRB up to z\u22481, and therefore we can rule out any typical kilonova in this range. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 A distant long GRB\n\n\n\nWe next consider the possibility that GRB 210704A is associated with the faint source S1. Intuitively, this may appear as the most likely association given the positional coincidence between S1 and the GRB. However,  the probability of chance coincidence is 2% (Table\u00a0<ref>), the highest among the three possible host candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe high-redshift derived from the photometric fit in \u00a0<ref> is consistent with the weak absorption feature in the afterglow optical spectrum (section <ref>). This provides us with tantalizing evidence that GRB 210704A was indeed located at z\u22482.3.\nAt this distance, its rest-frame duration would be \u22721.5\u00a0s.\nHowever, its other high-energy properties such as spectral lag (section\u00a0<ref>), peak energy, and energetics (section\u00a0<ref>), would fit within the distribution of typical LGRBs (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). \n\n\nIn this high-redshift scenario, the case of GRB 210704A is reminiscent of other bursts, such as GRB 090426A <cit.> and GRB 200826A <cit.>, characterized by a short duration of the gamma-ray emission despite likely having collapsing massive stars as progenitors. \nBased on the observed BATSE distribution of GRB durations <cit.>, a small fraction of LGRBs (\u22721%) is expected to last less than 2\u00a0s. It is therefore not surprising to find some of these examples within the sample of over 1,000 bursts discovered by Swift.\n\nHowever, in the case of GRB 210704A, the observed optical bump would be challenging to explain with standard SN models.\nAt a redshift of 2.3, the simple blackbody model adopted for the optical/nIR excess implies a\ntemperature of 30000\u00a0K and a sub-relativistic velocity of \u223c 0.2 c. The second solution of a colder black body peaking in the observed J-band requires a superluminal speed, and is thus considered unphysical.\n\nThe observed magnitude of the excess of r\u224823 AB at T+7\u00a0d implies an absolute magnitude of M_UV\u2248-23.2 at T+2.3\u00a0d (rest-frame) (after subtracting the afterglow contribution), brighter than most known SNe <cit.> and AT2018cow-like events <cit.> (see Figure\u00a0<ref>). The only event whose brightness in UV is comparable with the excess of GRB 210704A is the Dougie tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate <cit.>. However, \nknown TDEs evolve on slower timescales than the excess of GRB210704A. \n\nMechanisms capable of producing such a high peak brightness and rapid rise time are rare.\nFor instance, the interaction between the SN shock wave and a dense environment, or the continued energy injection from a long-lived central engine are also expected to act on longer timescales than the ones observed here <cit.> . \n<cit.> suggested that, for the most energetic explosions (\u227310^52 erg), a shock breakout propagating through a dense stellar wind could produce strong emission in excess of 10^44 erg s^-1, peaking \nin the UV on timescales of a few days after the burst. This emission becomes dominant when the Ni^56 yield is low\nas expected if the star directly collapses to a black hole. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 A nearby peculiar GRB\n\n\n\nA final possibility is that GRB 210704A is a peculiar GRB associated with a member of the galaxy cluster at z = 0.203. \n\n\n\n<cit.> showed that progenitor systems formed within a cluster are likely to be retained within the potential well of its halo, regardless of the intrinsic kick velocity of the progenitor system. However, due to the high merger activity in such crowded environment, the GRB may happen far from its true birthplace. As a result, its host galaxy cannot be confidently identified based on its spatial proximity. \n\nA cluster environment, although rarely associated with a GRB, has been discussed in the case of both SGRBs and LGRBs. \nThe connection with SGRBs naturally arises as NS binaries with long merger timescales are expected to track the stellar mass density and reside in evolved stellar environments. \nHowever, as discussed in section\u00a0<ref>, a SGRB produced by a typical NS merger would not produce a kilonova compatible with the luminosity and late-onset of the optical excess.\n\nIn the case of LGRBs, their typical progenitors, young massive stars <cit.>, are not found in clusters, and a merger-driven explosion with unusual progenitors appears to be the most likely explanation. For example, black hole and neutron star systems (BH-NS), black hole and white dwarf (BH-WD), white dwarf and neutron star (WD-NS) or WD-WD  encounters have been considered <cit.>. \n\nAn exotic progenitor system could explain the unusual high-energy properties of this event and why they do not fit within the standard relations of typical LGRBs for z\u223c0.2. In addition, we note that the only other LGRB possibly associated with a galaxy cluster is GRB\u00a0050911 <cit.>, whose prompt emission was a short duration (\u223c1\u00a0s) peak followed by a weak 16\u00a0s long tail and as such resembles the light curve of GRB\u00a0210704A. A LGRB produced by an exotic merger system could also give rise to a peculiar optical transient, although in this case, predictions are less secure. \n\nAssuming that the optical excess is radioactively-powered, we consider the case of ejecta with pure nickel abundance. This is justified by the rapid evolution of the optical emission, comparable to the ^56Ni half-life timescale  of about 6\u00a0d. \nAt a redshift of z \u2248 0.2, the optical bump would peak at an absolute magnitude of M_r\u2248-16.5, corresponding to a luminosity of about 10^42\u00a0erg\u00a0s^-1. The peak bolometric luminosity can be related to the ejecta mass M_ej using Arnett's law, L_pk\u2248\u03f5_ Ni(t_pk) M_ej, where \u03f5_ Ni(t_pk) \u2248 5\u00d710^43\u00a0erg\u00a0s^-1 is the energy generation rate at 6\u00a0d (rest-frame). \nThe derived mass M_ej\u22480.1 \u00a0is much smaller than in a typical SN, and indicative of a weaker explosion. \n\nBased on the black-body fit of the optical excess, we derived a temperature of 4500\u201310000\u00a0 K and ejecta velocity v_ ej\u22480.2-0.02 c. \nTherefore, the basic properties of the  optical excess, such as its luminosity and fast timescales, could be reproduced by an explosion ejecting a low-mass shell of fast-moving material, composed mainly of ^56Ni. \nAt first order, this is consistent with the predictions of an  accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a WD <cit.>, \ndriven for example from a WD-WD encounter <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\nWe have presented broadband observations of GRB 210704A, its afterglow, and environment.\n\n\nAfter its discovery, the burst was initially classified as a SGRB.\nOur analysis of the high-energy prompt emission shows that the GRB duration is affected by instrumental selection effects, and that the GRB lies at the intersection between SGRBs and LGRBs.\nWe place the GRB in the context of the Amati and spectral lag correlations, and show that these can provide information on the nature of the GRB at different possible redshifts.\n\n\nAn additional peculiar feature of this GRB is an optical/nIR excess, observed to peak at about T+7 days (observer's frame)\nat a magnitude r\u224823.2 AB. \nWe identified this excess by comparing our optical and nIR photometry with a simple afterglow model derived from the X-ray data. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe consider three possible host environments and distance scales: the galaxy G1 at z \u2248 0.08, the galaxy S1 at z \u2248 2.3, and a galaxy's cluster at z\u22480.2. We also discuss three different progenitors: a standard SGRB with a kilonova, a standard LGRB with a SN, and an exotic LGRB, perhaps an accretion-induced collapse of a WD <cit.>.\n\nNone of the standard explanations is entirely satisfactory. A SGRB followed by a kilonova, perhaps associated with G1, explains the short duration of the prompt gamma-ray emission, its other high-energy properties, and the large distance from the host galaxy. However, the color and timescales of the observed optical excess imply an expansion velocity not typical for the ejecta of a compact binary merger. \n\nOn the other hand, a LGRB associated with the galaxy S1 remains consistent with all the high-energy properties of the event but is challenged by the extreme luminosity of the optical excess. No known transient matches the high luminosity, blue color, and rapid timescales implied by the observations.  \n\nFinally, we considered an exotic progenitor, involving the merger of a WD with another compact objects (either a BH, a NS, or another WD), in the cluster at z \u2248 0.2. \nSuch stellar encounters can explain GRB durations longer than the canonical 2 seconds and could be followed by fast-evolving optical transients consistent with the observed excess. This is the only scenario that matches all the observed properties of GRB210704A although, admittedly, is also the least constrained one. \n\n\nThe difficulty we have had in identifying the progenitor of GRB 210704A highlights the limitations of the traditional GRB dichotomy in long/short, collapsars/mergers events. Although valid for the majority of bursts, it is not sufficient to describe the GRB population in its entirety. The large Swift sample of well-localized bursts has been instrumental to identify these oddball GRBs and start exploring their possible origins. In the next few years, the arrival of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will undoubtedly enlarge the sample of exotic transient events and perhaps help us find analogues to GRB 210704A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RESEARCH DATA POLICY\n\nThe data underlying this article will be shared on reasonable request to the corresponding author.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n\n\nWe thank the staff of GTC and Gemini for scheduling and executing the observations included in this work, especially Antonio Cabrera and  David Garcia.\n\n\nThis project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, grant  101002761 (BHianca; PI: Troja).\n\nSome of the data used in this paper were acquired with the RATIR instrument, funded by the University of California and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and the 1.5-meter Harold L.
