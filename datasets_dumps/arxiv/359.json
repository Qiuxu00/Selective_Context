Such a verctor x is said to be hypercyclic vector for T, and the set of all hypercyclic vectors for T is denoted by HC(T). Finally, T is said to be chaotic if it is hypercyclic and its set of periodic points is dense in X.We refer to <cit.> for a more detailed study of hypercyclicity and chaoticity.\n\nThe study of linear dynamics has a long history and it is closely connected to the problem of invariant subspaces in Hilbert spaces.\nIn <cit.>, Birkhoff showed the hypercyclicity of the operator of translation on the space H(\u2102)of entire functions, while MacLane\u2019s result<cit.> was on the hypercyclicity of the differentiation operator on H(\u2102). And later the first example of a hypercyclic operator on a Banach space was given by Rolewicz <cit.> in 1969, he showed that for any \u03bb with |\u03bb|>1, the shift \u03bb B( x_n ) _n=( \u03bb x_n+1) _n are hypercyclic on the sequence space \u2113^2. Motivated by these examples, the hypercyclicity and chaoticity of linear operators, as one of the most-studied properties in linear dynamics, has become an active area of research<cit.>.\n\nAmong these examples, the most-studied class is certainly that of weighted shifts. Following the paper of Rolewicz<cit.>, In 1995,\u00a0Salas <cit.> characterized hypercyclic and weakly mixing unilateral and bilateral weighted shifts on \u2113^2 and \u2113^2(\u2124) respectively while he characterized the supercyclic bilateral weighted shifts on Fr\u00e9chet space in <cit.>. The mixing weighted backward shift on \u2113^2 and \u2113^2(\u2124) were characterized by Costakis and Sambarino<cit.>. Furthermore, Mart\u00ednez and Peris<cit.> gave new examples of chaotic backward shift operators in the special case of K\u00f6the sequence spaces.\n\nIn <cit.>, the sufficient and necessary condition for the hypercyclicity of the weighted shift operator have been shown:\n\n    Let T be a continuous weighted backward shift on \u2113^2(\u2115) defined by T(\u2211_k\u2208\u2115x_ke_k) =\u2211_k\u2208\u2115w_kx_k+1e_k. Then T is  hypercyclic if and only if there is an increasing sequence ( n_k ) _k\u2208\u2115\u00a0of positive integers such that the weight sequence { w_k } _k\u2208\u2115 satisfies\n\n    \u220f_j=1^n_k| w_j |\u2192\u221e ,   as n_k\u2192\u221e.\n\n\n\nThis result is generalized by K.-G. Grosse-Erdmann to Fr\u00e9chet space in <cit.> and the characterization of chaotic weighted backward shift is provided in the following terms:\n\n\n    Let T be a weighted backward shift on a Fr\u00e9chet space X in which ( e_n ) _n\u2208\u2115 is an unconditional basis. Then the following assertions are equivalent:\n\n     (1)  T is chaotic.\n\n     (2)  T has a nontrivial periodic point.\n\n     (3)  the series\n           \n    \u2211_n=1^\u221e( \u220f_k=1^nw_k) ^-1e_n\n\n     converges in X.\n\n\n Moreover, K.-G. Grosse-Erdmann proposed the weighted pseudo-shift operator and disscussed its hypercyclity in <cit.>. Let w\u2208\u2113^\u221e and \u03c6 be a self-map on the set of natural numbers \u2115={1,2,3...... }, the weighted pseudo-shift on \u2113^p is defined by \n\n    wC_\u03c6( x_n ) _n\u2208\u2115=( w_nx_\u03c6( n )) _n\u2208\u2115\n\nIt is stated in <cit.> that wC_\u03c6 is bounded if and only if sup_k\u2208\u2115| w_k |^p | \u03c6^-1 ( k ) | < \u221e (the symbol | \u03c6^-1 ( k ) |  stands for the cardinality of the set {\u03c6 ^-1( n ) } for n\u2265 1). In <cit.>,  Vijay K. Srivastava and Harish Chandra give a characterization of the hypercyclic weighted pseudo-shift as following:\n\n    The operator wC_\u03c6 : \u2113 ^p \u2192\u2113 ^p is hypercyclic if and only if the following assertions holds: \n    (1) \u03c6 is injective. \n\n    (2) \u03c6 ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115. \n\n    (3) For each n \u2208, there exists an increasing sequence { m_k }_k \u2208\u2115 of positive integers such that \n    \n    lim_k\u2192\u221e| w_ n w_ \u03c6( n )\u22ef w_ \u03c6 ^m_k-1( n )|=\u221e .\n\n\n\nWe need to note that the above studies are all for bounded operators. In fact, the unbounded hypercyclic operators have also attracted the interest of scholars. In <cit.>,  B\u00e8s, Chan, and Seubert have defined the notion of hypercyclicity and chaoticity for an unbounded operator. In <cit.>, R. deLaubenfels, H. Emamirad, and K.-G. Grosse-Erdmann generalize the notion of hypercyclic and chaotic semigroups to families of unbounded operators.\n\nLet T be an unbounded operator on a separable infinite dimensional Banach space X, the densely defined operator T is called hypercyclic if there is a vector f \u2208 D( T^\u221e)=\u22c2_n\u2265 1 D( T^n )\u00a0such that its orbit { f,Tf,T^2f,T^3f,...... } is dense in X. Every such vector f is called hypercyclic vector for T. If there exist an integer n\u2208\u2115 and a vector f\u2208 D( T^n ) such that T^nf=f, such vector is called periodic and the operator A is said to be chaotic if it possesses both  hypercyclic  vector and dense sets of periodic points.\n\n\nMotivated by  <cit.>, Our aim in this paper is to extend the above result to the unbounded weighted pseudo-shift for establishing a necessary and sufficient condition in order that a such operator to be hypercyclic or chaotic on \u2113^p and c_0 respectively.\n\nFor achieving this end, we have to use a Hypercyclicity Criterion for unbounded operators. Such a criterion has been already provided by B\u00e8s, Chan, and Seubert <cit.> in the following terms:\n\n    Let X be a separable infinite dimensional Banach space and let T be a densely defined linear operator on X for which T^n is a closed operator for all positive integers n. If there exist a dense subset Y of the domain of T and a (possibly nonlinear and discontinuous) mapping S: Y \u2192 Y such that \n\n    (1) TSy = y, for all y \u2208 Y,\n\n    (2) lim_n \u2192\u221e S^n y = 0, for all y \u2208 Y,\n\n    (3) lim_n \u2192\u221e T^n y = 0, for all y \u2208 Y,\n\n    then T is hypercyclic.\n\n\nTheorem <ref> also holds when the entire sequence of positive integers in hypothesis is replaced by a subsequence of positive integers. To prove hypercyclicty, we also need the following theorem given in <cit.>.\n\n    Let T be a hypercyclic operator. Then its adjoint T^* has no eigenvalues. Equivalently, every operator T - \u03bb I, \u03bb\u2208\ud835\udd42, has dense range.\n\n\nIn <cit.>, H. Emamirad and G.S. Heshmati characterized unbounded chaotic backward\nshift operators on \u2113^2 in the following terms:\n\n    Let T be a unbounded backward shift operator on  \u2113^2. Then the following assertions are equivalent:\n\n    (1)  T is chaotic.\n\n    (2)  T has a nontrivial periodic point.\n\n    (3)  the positive series\n    \n    \u2211_n=1^\u221e\u220f_j=0^n-11/| w_j |^2<+\u221e.\n\n\n\nBasing on the above theorems, we extend theorem <ref> to unbounded weighted pseudo-shift in section 2. And in section 3, we give a characterization of the chaotic weighted pseudo-shift operator on \u2113^p as following:\n\n         Let wC_\u03c6\u00a0be a unbounded weighted pseudo-shift operator on \u2113^p, then wC_\u03c6 is chaotic if and only if the following assertions hold:  \n\n        (1) \u03c6 is injective.\n\n        (2)  \u03c6 ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115.\n\n        \n        (3)  \u2200 k \u2208, the following inequalities hold\n        \n    \u2211_n=1^+\u221e1/| w_kw_\u03c6( k )...w_\u03c6 ^n-1( k )|^p<+\u221e ,\n\n        and\n        \n    \u2211_n=1^+\u221e| w_\u03c6 ^-1( k )w_\u03c6 ^-2( k )...w_\u03c6 ^-n( k )|^p<+\u221e.\n\n    \n\n    In section 3, we also extend the above result to the space c_0 .\n\n\n\n\u00a7 HYPERCYCLICITY\n\nIn <cit.>,  the necessary and sufficient condition for the hypercyclity of bounded weighted pseudo-shift operators on \u2113^p is given and in this section we extend it to the unbounded case. If the operator wC_ is unbounded, then sup_n\u2208\u2115| w( n ) |=\u221e or sup_n\u2208\u2115 card{\u03c6 ^-1( n ) } =\u221e. We will see in below that the hypercyclicity of wC_ implies that \u03c6 is injective. So for the unbounded operator wC_, we only concern the case when sup_n\u2208\u2115| w( n ) |=\u221e. Denote\n\n    e_n = ( n - 1 0,\u22ef ,0, 1, 0,\u22ef) ,   n\u2208.\n\nand\n\n    c_00={ x=( x_k ) _k\u2208\u2115\u2208\ud835\udd42^\u2115| \u2203 N\u2208\u2115, s.t. \u2200 k\u2265 N, x_k=0 . }\n\nthe space c_00 is dense in \u2113^p or c_0, we will always use this notation below. Let { w_k } _k\u2208\u2115 be an arbitrary weight sequence, we define the unbounded weighted pseudo-shift wC_ on \u2113^p by\n\n    wC_ (\u2211_k=1^\u221ex_ke_k) = \u2211_k=1^\u221ew_k  x_ (k) e_k\n\n where sup_k\u2208\u2115| w(k) |^p card{\u03c6 ^-1( n ) } = +\u221e, with the domain\n\n    D(wC_ ) = { x \u2208 l^p  |  \u2211_k=1^\u221ew_k  x_(k) e_k \u2208 l^p . }.\n\nBy the definition of wC_, \n\n    (\u2211_k=1^\u221ex_ke_k) = \u2211_k=1^\u221ew_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) x_^n (k) e_k\n\n   where sup_k\u2208\u2115| w(k) |^pcard{\u03c6 ^-1( n ) } = +\u221e, with the domain\n    \n    D(wC_ ^n) = { x \u2208 l^p  |  \u2211_k=1^\u221ew_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) x_^n (k) e_k \u2208 l^p . }.\n\nfor all n \u2208\u2115.\n\nBefore proving the necessary and sufficient condition for the hypercyclicity of unbounded operator wC_ on \u2113^p , we need to show some lemmas.\n\n        Suppose map \u03c6 : \u2115\u2192\u2115 is injective and \u03c6 ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115. Then\n\n        (1)  \u2200 n \u2208 ,  ^n (k) \u221e  (k \u221e).\n\n        (2)  \u2200 k \u2208 ,  ^n (k) \u221e  (n \u221e).\n\n\n(1). Firstly, we show that \u03c6 ^n is injective for any n \u2265 1. Assume \u03c6 ^k-1 is injective, if there exists i,j \u2208\u2115 such that ^k (i) =  ^k (j)\u00a0i.e ( ^k-1 (i)) = ( ^k-1 (j)). Since \u03c6 is injective, then ^k-1 (i) =  ^k-1 (j). So by the assumption, i=j. Thus by induction, it follows that \u2200 n \u2208, ^n is injective.\n\n Conversely, suppose there exists n_0 \u2208\u2115 such that \u03c6 ^n_0( k ) \u219b\u221e as k\u2192\u221e, that is there exists a bounded subsequence {^n_0(m_k)}_k \u2208 of {^n_0(k) }_k\u2208\u2115. Suppose there exists M \u2208\u2115 such that \u2200 k \u2208 ,  ^n_0(m_k) \u2264 M. Consider the following set\n \n    {^n_0(m_1), ^n_0(m_2), \u22ef, ^n_0(m_M), ^n_0(m_M+1) }\n\nNote that each ^n_0(k) is a positive integer, by pigeonhole principle, there must exists positive integer i,j \u2264 M+1 ( i j ) such that ^n_0 (m_i) =  ^n_0 (m_j), which is a contradiction to the fact that ^n_0 is injective.\n\n(2). Conversely, suppose there exists k_0 \u2208\u2115 such that \u03c6 ^n( k_0 ) \u219b\u221e as n\u2192\u221e, that is there exists a bounded subsequence {^m_k(k_0)}_k \u2208 of {^n(k_0) }_n\u2208\u2115. Suppose there exists M\u2208\u2115 such that \u2200 k \u2208 ,  ^m_k(k_0) \u2264 M. Consider the following set\n\n    {^m_1 (k_0), ^m_2 (k_0), \u22ef, ^m_M (k_0), ^m_M+1 (k_0) }\n\nBy pigeonhole principle, there must exists positive integer i,j \u2264 M+1 ( i j ) such that ^m_i (k_0) =  ^m_j (k_0). This contradicts the fact that \u03c6 ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115.\n\n\n\n         Suppose map \u03c6 : \u2115\u2192\u2115 is injective and \u03c6 ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115. Then the subspace\n        \n    D( [ wC_]^\u221e)  = \u22c2_n\u2265 1 D( [ wC_] ^n )\n\n        is dense in \u2113^p.\n\n\n\u2200 x=\u2211_k=1^\u221ex_k e_k\u2208 c_00, there exists N_1>0 such that \u2200 k>N_1, x_k=0. Since \u03c6 is injective, by Lemma <ref>  (1), there exists N_2>0 such that \u2200 k>N_2, ^n(k)>N_1. Take N=max{ N_1,N_2 }, then \u2200 k > N, x_k = x_^n (k) = 0.\n\nHence, \u2200 n\u2208\n    \n    (x) = \u2211_k=1^\u221ew_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) x_^n (k) e_k  .\n\nhas only finite term coefficients that are not zero, which implies (x)\u2208 l^p. So c_00\u2282 D( [  w C_] ^n ) \u2282 l^p, and in view of the denseness of c_00 in \u2113^p, it follows that D( [  w C_] ^n ) is dense in \u2113^p. By the arbitary of n, the conclusion is proven.\n\n\nThis lemma legitimates the research of hypercyclicity of the unbounded operator wC_ in the framework of Definition <ref>. And in order to use the hypercyclicity criterion <ref>, we have to ensure that for each n\u2208\u2115, the operator  is closed.\n\n    \u2200 n\u2208\u2115,  the operator  defined by (<ref>) and (<ref>) is closed.\n\n\nsuppose that as j \u2192\u221e,\n\n    \n    D( [ wC_] ^n )  x_j = \u2211_k=1^\u221ec_k,j e_k   \u2192\u2211_k=1^\u221ec_k^* e_k = x^*\u2208 l^p .\n            \n     (x_j)    \u2192\u2211_k=1^\u221ed_k^* e_k = f^* \u2208 l^p.\n\n    \nby ( <ref>), we infer that \u2200 k \u2208 , c_k,j c_k^* as j \u2192\u221e. So\n\n    \u2211_k=1^\u221ew_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) c_^n (k), j\u2211_k=1^\u221ew_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) c_^n (k)^*   .\n\nby ( <ref>), \n\n    (x_j) = \u2211_k=1^\u221ew_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) c_^n (k), j e_k  f^* = \u2211_k=1^\u221ed_k^* e_k  .\n\nHence, \n    \n    w_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) c_^n (k), j d_k^*.\n\nIt follows that\n\n    w_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) c_^n (k)^* = d_k^*.\n\nThus,\n\n    x^*    =  (\u2211_k=1^\u221ec_k^* e_k)\n       = \u2211_k=1^\u221ew_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) c_^n (k)^* e_k \n       = \u2211_k=1^\u221ed_k^* e_k = f^*.\n\nThis implies that x^*\u2208 D( [ wC_] ^n ) and x^* = f^*. So we can conclude that the operator  is closed for each n\u2208\u2115. \n\n\n\n        Suppose \u2200 n\u2208\u2115, w(n)  0. If the unbounded weighted pseudo-shift operator wC_ on \u2113^p is hypercyclic, then \u03c6 is injective.\n\n\nConversely, suppose there exists k_1, k_2\u2208\u2115( k_1  k_2)  such that (k_1) =  (k_2) = l. Let the operator  is hypercyclic, then the range Im( wC_ ) is dense in \u2113^p. So for e_k_1\u2208 l^p, \u2200 m \u2208\u2115 ,  there exists \u00a0a vector x_m \u2208 D( [ wC_]^\u221e) such that \u2016 (x_m) - e_k_1\u2016\u22641/m , that is \n\n    \u2016 ( w_1x_ (1), \u22ef , w_k_1-1x_ (k_1-1), w_k_1x_ (k_1) - 1, w_k_1+1x_ (k_1+1), \u22ef) \u2016\u22641/m.\n\nHence,\n\n        \n    |w(k_1)x_ (k_1) - 1|    \u22641/m ,\n                \n    \n                |w(k_2)x_ (k_2)|    \u22641/m .\n\n     \nBy (<ref>),\n\n    |x_l|=|x_ (k_1)|=\u22651/|w_k_1| (1-1/m) 1/|w_k_1| ( m \u221e).\n\nBy (<ref>),\n\n    |x_l|=|x_ (k_2)|\u22641/m|w_k_2| 0  ( m \u221e).\n\nThis is a Contradiction, which completes the proof.\n\n\n\n        If the unbounded  weighted pseudo-shift operator wC_ on \u2113^p is hypercyclic, then \u03c6 ^n has no fixed point for each n \u2208\u2115.\n\n\nLet wC_ is hypercyclic.  Conversely, supposes \u03c6 ^n has some fixed points for each n \u2208\u2115, then there exists l,n\u2208\u2115 such that ^n (l) = l. Let f_l(x) = x_l,  then f_l is a bounded linear functional on \u2113^p. By the definition of the adjoint ( wC_\u03c6) ^*,\n \n    ( ( ( wC_) ^n ) ^\u2217( f_l ) ) (x)\n               = ( f_l ( ( wC_) ^n ) (x) )\n       =  f_l ( ( wC_) ^n (x) ) \n       =  f_l ( ( w_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) x_^n (k))_k \u2208)\n       =  w_l w_(l)\u22ef w_^n-1 (l) x_^n (l)\n       =  w_l w_(l)\u22ef w_^n-1 (l) x_l\n       =  w_l w_(l)\u22ef w_^n-1 (l) f_l(x) .\n\n    Hence,\n\n    ( ( ( wC_) ^n ) ^\u2217( f_l ) ) =\n            w_l w_(l)\u22ef w_^n-1 (l) f_l(x) .\n\n It follows that f_l is an eigenvector of . Since wC_\u03c6 is hypercyclic, then ( wC_\u03c6) ^n is also hypercyclic, which is a contradiction to Theorem <ref>.\n \n\nBefore proving our conclusion, we need to extend the definition of . \u2200 n\u2208, we define\n\n    \u03c6 ^-n( k ) =\n    \tl ,   \u2203  l   s.t. \u03c6^n(l) = k,\n    \n    \t0 ,   \u03c6 ^-n( k ) =\u2205.\n\nMoreover, we specify e_0=(0,0,\u22ef,0,\u22ef) and w_0=0. By the definition of wC_, \n\n    (e_k)    =  w_^-n(k) w_^-(n-1)(k)\u22ef w_^-1(k) e_^-n(k).\n\nfor all n\u2208\u2115.\n\nNext, our conclusions are given.\n\n\n        The unbounded operator wC_ on \u2113^p is hypercyclic if and only if the following assertions holds: \n\n        (1)  is injective. \n\n        (2) ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115. \n\n        (3) For each n \u2208, there exists an increasing sequence { m_k }_k \u2208\u2115 of positive integers such that \n        \n    lim_k\u2192\u221e| w( n ) w( ( n ) ) \u22ef w(  ^m_k-1( n ) ) |=\u221e .\n\n    \n\nAssume w C_ is hypercyclic. By Theorem <ref> and Theorem <ref>, we infer that the condition ( 1 ) and( 2 ) hold. Now we need only to show ( 3 ). Since the set of hypercyclic vectors for w C_ is dense in \u2113^p, then \u2200\u03b4 _k>0, there exists a vector x\u2208 HC(  w C_) (also belongs to D( [  w C_] ^\u221e) ) such that \u2016 x-e_n \u2016 <\u03b4 _k. Therefore, \u2200 k n,\n\n    | x_k |<\u03b4 _k\u21d2| x_ ^j( n )|<\u03b4 _k, \u00a0\u2200 j\u2208 N  ( \u03c6 ^n has no fixed point )\n\nSince x\u2208 HC(  w C_), then orb( x, w C_) dense\u2282l^p. So there exists m>0 such that\n \n    \u2016(  w C_) ^mx-e_n \u2016 <\u03b4_k ,\n\n Hence,\n \n    <  |  w _n w _( n )\u22ef w _ ^m-1( n )x_ ^m( n )-1 | \n       < (  |w _n w _( n )\u22ef w _ ^m-1( n )x_ ^m( n )-1| ^p +  \u2211_k \u2208, k  n|w _n w _( n )\u22ef w _ ^m-1( n )x_ ^m( n )|^p ) ^1/p\n        = \u2016(  w C_) ^mx-e_n \u2016\n       < \u03b4 _k.\n\nTherefore,\n\n    1-|  w _n w _( n )\u22ef w _ ^m-1( n )x_ ^m( n )|<\u03b4 _k ,\n\nThus,\n\n    |  w _n w _( n )\u22ef w _ ^m-1( n )|>1-\u03b4 _k/| x_ ^m( n )|>1-\u03b4 _k/\u03b4 _k = 1/\u03b4_k - 1.\n\nBy the arbitary of \u03b4_k, we can choose a sequence  {\u03b4 _k } which tends to 0 , so the condition  ( 3 ) is necessary if w C_ is hypercylic.  \n\nFor the sufficient part of the proof, we will use the Hypercyclicity Criterion stated in Theorem <ref>. The closedness of  is already proved in Lemma <ref>. Assume the condition ( 1 ) ,( 2 ) ,( 3 ) hold, now we define the map\n  \n    S:   c_00   \u2192 c_00\n    ( e_n )    \u2192e_( n )/ w _n,\n\nAs is easily seen, \u2200 n\u2208 N\n\n    ( wC_) ( S( e_n ) )    = w C_( e_( n )/ w _n) =e_n .\n\n\u2200 x=\u2211_k=1^\u221ex_k e_k\u2208 c_00, there exists N_1>0 such that \u2200 k>N_1, x_k=0. In view of the condition ( 1 ) ,( 2 ) and Theorem <ref> ( 2 ), for each k\u2208\u2115, there exists N_2>0 such that \u2200 n>N_2, ^n(k)>N_1. So take N=max{ N_1,N_2 }, we infer that for any n>N, x_ ^n( k )=0. So for each x\u2208 c_00,\n \n    ( (  w C_) S ) ( x ) =\u2211_k=1^\u221ex_k [ ( wC_) ( S( e_k ) )]\n            =\u2211_k=1^\u221ex_k e_k\n            = x\n\nand\n\n    (x) = \u2211_k=1^\u221ew_k w_(k)\u22ef w_^n-1 (k) x_^n (k) e_k \u2192 0  ( n\u2192\u221e) .\n\nFurther, by the definition of S,\n\n    \u2016 S^nx \u2016   = \u2016 S^n( \u2211_k=1^Nx_ke_k) \u2016\n       =\u2016\u2211_k=1^Nx_k e_ ^n( k )/ w _k w _( k )\u22ef w _ ^n-1( k )\u2016\n       =( \u2211_k=1^N| x_k |^p1/| w_kw_\u03c6( k )...w_\u03c6 ^n-1( k )|^p) ^1/p\n       \u2264\u2016 x \u2016( \u2211_k=1^N1/| w_kw_\u03c6( k )...w_\u03c6 ^n_k-1( k )|^p) ^1/p.\n\nNow in view of the condition on w that for each n \u2208, there exists an increasing sequence { m_k }_k \u2208\u2115 of positive integers such that \n\n    lim_k\u2192\u221e| w( n ) w( ( n ) ) \u22ef w(  ^m_k-1( n ) ) |=\u221e .\n\nfor each x\u2208 c_00, we obtain that \n\n    S^m_k x \u2192 0 ,( k \u2192\u221e).\n\nHence with (<ref>),(<ref>),(<ref>), w C_ satisfies the Hypercyclicity Criterion stated in Theorem <ref>, thus w C_ is hypercyclic.\n\n\nAs is easily seen that the characterization of the hypercyclic weighted pseudo-shift operator w C_ is the same in both the bounded and unbounded cases. So using the same approach, we can extend the conclusion to weighted pseudo-shift operators (whether bounded or unbounded) on the space c_0.\n\n\n        The weighted pseudo-shift operator wC_ on c_0 is hypercyclic if and only if the following assertions holds: \n\n        (1)  is injective. \n\n        (2) ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115. \n\n        (3) For each n \u2208, there exists an increasing sequence { m_k }_k \u2208\u2115 of positive integers such that \n        \n    lim_k\u2192\u221e| w( n ) w( ( n ) ) \u22ef w(  ^m_k-1( n ) ) |=\u221e .\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a7 CHAOTICITY\n\n  In this section, we will give a necessary and sufficient condition in order that w C_ be a chaotic operator. Some preparation is needed before proving it. And the discussion of chaoticity requires us to pay more attention to some properties of , so in first section we will  prove a few lemmas.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Some Lemmas\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following lemma is provided as a supplement to Lemma <ref>.\n\n\n        Suppose  is injective and ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115, then for any k\u2208, if \u2200 n \u2208,  ^-n(k)  0,  then ^-n (k) \u221e  (n \u221e).\n\n\nConversely, suppose there exists k_0 \u2208\u2115 such that ^-n (k_0)\u219b\u221e  (n \u221e), then there exists a bounded subsequence {^-m_k(k_0)}_k \u2208 of {\u03c6 ^-n( k_0 ) } _n \u2208. Suppose there exists M\u2208\u2115 such that \u2200 k \u2208 ,  ^-m_k(k_0) \u2264 M. Consider the following set\n\n    {^-m_1 (k_0), ^-m_2 (k_0), \u22ef, ^-m_M (k_0), ^-m_M+1 (k_0) }\n\nBy pigeonhole principle, there must exists positive integer i,j \u2264 M+1 ( i j ) such that ^-m_i (k_0) =  ^-m_j (k_0). This contradicts the fact that \u03c6 ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115.\n\n\nFor each n \u2208 and any positive integer k, we denote a \u201c^n bi-orbit\" (later referred to as  \u201c^n-orbit\"  ) of k by the set\n\n    A_n,k = orb(k,^n) \u222a orb(k,\u03d5^n)= {^in(k) | i \u2208} - { 0 },\n\nWhere \u03d5=^-1. Moreover, we denote A_k = A_1,k and B_n,k = {^in(k) | i \u2208 , i 0 } - { 0 } = A_n,k - { k }.\n\nThe reason for dropping { 0 } from the definition of A_n,k is to satisfy the previous definition in ( <ref>)  which will make it easier for us to select the minimum element A_n,k. By definition, it is easy to know the set A_n,k\u2286. \n\nWhen \u03c6  is injective, for any fixed k, there are two cases : when k is a fixed point of \u03c6 for some n, A_k is a finite set; when k is not fixed point of \u03c6 for any n, A_k is an infinite set. It is worth noting that there are also two cases in which A_k is an infinite set: one is when there exists n \u2208 such that ^-n(k) = 0 i.e there is a point without an  preimage under ^n in the orbit A_k (this point is like the \u201cgenerator\" of the orbit); and the other is when ^-n(k)  0 for any n \u2208 , that is, there is no point without an  preimage under ^n in the orbit A_k. The above statement also holds for A_n,k.\n\nNext, we give some examples of \u03c6 for better illustration.\n\n\n        Consider the mapping \u03c6( n ) =\n\t2,   \t\tn=1\n\n\t3,   \t\tn=2\n\n        1,   \t\tn=3\n\n        4,   else.\n    \nIn this case, \u2200 k=1,2,3, A_k={1,2,3} is a finite set and k is a fixed point of \u03c6.\n\n\n     Consider the mapping \u03c6( n )=n+1,  \u2200 n \u2208\u2115.\n\nFor k=1, ^-1(1) = 0 i.e 1 has no preimage. In this case, A_1=\u2115 is an infinite set and there is only one -orbit  A_1, that is, for any k \u2208, A_k=A_1. Furthermore, ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115.\n\n\n     Consider the mapping \u03c6( n ) =\n\t5k-4,   \t\tn=5k+1\n\n\t5k+2,   \t\tn=5k \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(k\u2265 1) \n\n        n+1,   else.\n\nFor any k,n\u2208\u2115,  ^-n(k)   0, that is, there is no point without an preimage. In this case, there is only one -orbit  A_1. Moreover, A_1=\u2115 is an infinite set and ^n has no fixed point for any n \u2208\u2115.\n\n\n    Suppose  is injective without any periodic point, then for each k and N,\n\n    (1)  \u2200 n \u2208 orb(k,^N), let \u03c6^n_1N( k ) =n (n_1 \u2208), then lim_n\u221en_1=\u221e;\n\n    (2)  \u2200 n \u2208 orb(k,\u03d5^N), let \u03c6 ^-n_2N( k ) =n (n_2 \u2208), then lim_n\u221en_2=\u221e.\n\n\n    (1). For any positive integer M, let L = {^n_1N|n_1\u2264 M} and N = sup L, then when n \u2208 orb(k,^N) and n>N, we have n_1>M. This is because if n_1<M, then n = ^n_1N\u2208 L, hence n\u2264sup L= N, which makes a contradiction. Therefore, we have lim_n\u221en_1=\u221e.\n    \n    (2). For any M \u2208, let L = {^-n_2N|n_2\u2264 M} and N = sup L, then when n \u2208 orb(k,\u03d5^N) and n>N, we have n_2>M. This is because if n_2<M, then n = ^-n_2N\u2208 L, hence n\u2264sup L= N, which makes a contradiction. Therefore, we have lim_n\u221en_2=\u221e.\n\n\n\nThe following lemma shows that the different ^n orbits are disjoint when \u03c6 is injective.\n\n \n        Suppose  is injective, then for all  distinct k_1, k_2 \u2208 , their ^n-orbit either the same or disjoint. That is, if A_n,k_1 A_n,k_2, then A_n,k_1\u2229 A_n,k_2 = \u2205.\n\n\nFor any fixed n, suppose there exists k_1, k_2 \u2208 such that A_n,k_1\u2229 A_n,k_2\u2205,that is, there exists i,j \u2208 such that ^in(k_1) = ^jn(k_2) = l. If i=j, then by \u03c6 being a injection we infer that k_1 = k_2 , therefore A_n,k_1 = A_n,k_2. If i  j, we might assume that i>j, then k_2 = ^(i-j)n(k_1), k_2 is in the orbit of k_1 ,i.e , A_n,k_1 = A_n,k_2.\n\n\n\n\nDefine g_n(k)=inf{ A_n,k},  k \u2208, this is a mapping from  to   which maps each k \u2208 to the smallest element in A_n,k . We may regard the orbit A_n,k to be generated by g_n(k) under ^n. Moreover, we let g(k)=g_1(k)=inf{ A_k}.\n\nDenote G_n = Im (g_n) as the range of g_n, which represents the set of \u201cgenerator\" for each ^n orbit, which may be finite or infinite, but must be countable. Moreover,  we let G=G_1=Im(g). The main purpose for this definition is to select the \u201cgenerator\" of each orbit.\n\nAgain, we give some examples for illustration.\n\n\n        Consider the mapping defined in (<ref>) and (<ref>).\n\nFor these two mappings, A_k=A_1=\u2115, and g(k)=1 ( \u2200 k\u2208\u2115). Thus G={ 1 } with | G |=1.\n\n\n         Consider the mapping \u03c6( n ) =\n\t5,   \t\t   n=1\n\n        5k+3,        n=5k-1\n\n\t5k+5,   \t   n=5k \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(k\u2265 1) \n\n        5k-4,        n=5k+1\n\n        5k-3,        n=5k+2\n\n        n+1,   else.\n\n  In this case, \u2115 is divided into two -orbit, A_1={ 1,5k,5k+1 }( k\u2265 1 ) and A_2=\u2115-A_1. Thus G={ 1,2 } with | G |=2.\n\n \n        Let P_i={ p_i^n | \u00a0p_i is the i-th prime number,  \u2200 i,n \u2208. } and  P_0=\u2115-\u22c3_i\u2265 1P_i. Then we arrange the elements in P_i in ascending order and denote P_i( m ) as the m-th element. It is clear that P_i( m ) = p_i^m (i\u2265 1).\n        \n        1.Consider the mapping \u03c6( P_i( k ) ) =P_i( k+1 ) , \u2200 i\u2265 0. \n        \n        In this case, Since there are infinitely many prime numbers, then \u2115 is divided into a countably infinite number of orbits. And there are points in each orbit with no preimage, actually for any i, ^-1(P_i(1))=0. Furthermore,  for any k \u2208, we can infer that g(P_i(k))=p_i   (i\u2208) and g(P_0(k))=1. In this case, G is the set of all prime numbers and 1, Thus | G |=+\u221e.\n\n        2. Consider the mapping  \u03c6( n ) =\n\tP_i( 2 ) ,   \t\tn=P_i( 1 )\n\n\tP_i( 3k ) ,   \t\tn=P_i( 3k-1 )\n\n        P_i( 3k+2 ) ,   \t\tn=P_i( 3k )\n\n        P_i( 3k-2 ) ,   \t\tn=P_i( 3k+1 ).\n        \n        In this case, \u2115 is divided into a countably infinite number of orbits.And there are points in each orbit with no preimage. Moreover, for any k \u2208, we infer that g(P_i(k))=p_i  (i\u2208) and g(P_0(k))=1. Thus, G is the set of all prime numbers and 1 with | G |=+\u221e.\n\n\nThe following lemma shows that we can divide the positive integers into some disjoint ^n orbits.\n\n \n        Suppose  is injective, then for \u2200 n \u2208 N,we have\n        \n    = _k\u2208 G_nA_n,k.\n\n    \n\nBy Lemma <ref>, we know that each orbit A_n,k is disjoint. Let S = _k\u2208 G_nA_n,k, it suffice to show that S \u2286 and \u2286 S. Clearly, S \u2286 since each A_n,k\u2286. On the other hand, \u2200 k \u2208, there exists l \u2208 such that g_n(k)=l\u2208 G_n, then k \u2208 A_n,l\u2286 S, hence \u2286 S.\n\n\n\n        Suppose  is injective, and  has no periodic point, then for every k,n \u2208, \n        \n    A_k    = A_2,k\u2294 A_2,(k)\n       = A_3,k\u2294 A_3,(k)\u2294 A_3,^2(k)\n       = _i=0^n-1A_n,\u03c6 ^i( k ).\n\n        So we have G \u2282 G_2 \u2282 G_3 \u2282\u22ef.\n\n\nBy Theorem <ref>, we know that each orbit A_n,k is disjoint. Let S=_i=0^n-1A_n,\u03c6 ^i( k ). For any k,n \u2208, \u2200 l \u2208 A_k, there exists m\u2208 such that l = ^m(k). \nAlso there exists a\u2208 and p \u2208{0,1,2,\u22ef,n-1 } such that m = an + p, it follows that l = ^m(k) = ^an + p(k) = ^an(^p(k)) \u2208 A_n,^p(k). Thus A_k \u2286 S. \n\nOn the other hand, for any l \u2208 S, there exists a\u2208,  p \u2208{0,1,2,\u22ef,n-1 } such that l = ^an(^p(k)), let m = an + p, then l = ^an + p(k) = ^m(k) \u2208 A_k, so S \u2286 A_k which completes the proof. \n\n\n\n        Suppose  is injective, and  has no periodic point, then for any finite set F \u2286, and every k \u2208, there exists a N \u2208 such that for any n > N,\n        \n    B_n,k\u2229 F = \u2205.\n\n\n\nFor any finite set F \u2286, there exists M>0 such that  max{ F } <M.\n By Lemma <ref> (2), \u2200 k\u2208, there exists N_1 \u2208 such that for any n>N_1, ^n(k)>M.
