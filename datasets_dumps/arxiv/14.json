Lukin^1\n    March 30, 2023\n======================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAlgebras of polynomial differential operators are objects used throughout mathematics, sitting at the interface of analysis, geometry, topology, and algebra. \nOver a field of characteristic zero,\nthe algebra of differential operators _X on a variety X consists of operators locally of the form \n\u2211_I f_I \u2202^i_1/\u2202^i_1 x_1\u22ef\u2202^i_n/\u2202^i_n x_n\nwhere x_1,\u2026, x_n are local coordinates and f_I are regular functions on X.\n\n\nOne can also consider differential operators over a field of positive characteristic; then the definition must be modified to account for the identity (d/dx)^px^n = 0 in characteristic p. In this paper, we study differential operators with divided powers, formulated by Grothendieck in connection with crystalline cohomology. This algebra includes operators such as (p!)^-1(d/dx)^p. Precise definitions are given in \u00a7<ref> below. \n\nHochschild cohomology is a fundamental invariant of associative algebra A. As a ring, the Hochschild cohomology HH^*(A) coincides with self-extensions of the A-bimodule A. Gerstenhaber showed that the bar complex of the A-bimodule A controls deformations of the product on A <cit.>. Since then, Hochschild cohomology has attracted considerable interest due to its connection to deformations.\n\nIn this note, we prove:\n\n[see Theorem <ref>]\n    Let k be a field of postitive characteristic, X a smooth variety over k, \n    and _X the ring of differential operators on X.\n    Then there are short exact sequences \n    \n    0 \u2192 R^1_r H^m-1(X,_X)^(r)\u2192 HH^m(_X) \u2192_r H^m(X,_X)^(r)\u2192 0\n\n    for all m \u2265 0, where the inverse limit is taken over the sequence of relative Frobenius maps Fr: H^\u2217(X,_X)^(r+1)\u2192 H^\u2217(X,_X)^(r).\n\n\nWe also consider the cup product structure on HH^*(_X) in \u00a7<ref>. There it is shown that the map HH^*(_X) \u2192_r H^m(X,_X^(r)) is a map of graded rings.\n\nOver the field \u2102 of complex numbers, it follows from work of Wodzicki that HH^*(_X) \u2245 H^\u2217_dR(X/\u2102) for smooth affine X <cit.>. In fact, in loc cit. Wodzicki calculates the Hochschild homology as HH_*(_X/\u2102) \u2245 H_dR^2 X - \u2217(X/\u2102), reflecting that _X/\u2102 is a Calabi-Yau algebra of dimension 2  X. One year later, Wodzicki calculated the Hochschild homology of _X for X smooth affine over k of positive characteristic <cit.>. He showed that HH_*(_X) is concentrated in degree n =  X and HH_n(_X) = \u03a9^n_X / B_\u221e\u03a9^n_X, where B_\u221e\u03a9^n_X are the potentially exact forms. Unlike in characteristic zero, Wodzicki's method does not apply to Hochschild cohomology. Our results show _X over a field of positive characteristic is not Calabi-Yau, as for affine X, HH^*(_X) will have amplitude exactly [0,1].\n\nIf X is not affine, then _X is not an associative algebra but rather a sheaf of such; this makes defining an appropriate category of bimodules more difficult. Hochschild cohomology of ringed spaces and, more generally, abelian categories has been developed by Lowen and Van den Bergh <cit.>, following earlier work by Gerstenhaber and Schack on cohomology of diagrams of associative algebras <cit.>. Lowen and Van den Bergh showed that if \u00c5 is a sheaf of algebras on X which is locally acyclic with respect to a basis \u212c, then the Gerstenhaber-Schack cohomology of the diagram \u00c5_\u212c coincides with Hochschild cohomology of the category of \u00c5-modules <cit.>. This paper uses Gerstenhaber and Schack's definition of Hochschild cohomology of a diagram (see \u00a7<ref>); as _X is quasi-coherent, our computation thus agrees with categorical Hochschild cohomology.\n\nWe should point out that Ogus obtains very similar formulas for ^*__X(_X,_X) in <cit.>. The relationship is explained in Remark <ref>. \n\n\n\nAcknowledgments.\n\n    The author was supported by NSF Graduate Research Fellowship DGE 1746045. \n    The author thanks Luc Illusie for pointing out the paper <cit.> and Tim Porter for the reference <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PRELIMINARIES\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Differential operators\n\n\n\nLet k be a field.\nA smooth variety X over k will mean a morphism of schemes X \u2192 k which is smooth, separated, and of finite type. We recall Grothendieck's definition of differential operators on a smooth variety, following <cit.>.\n\n\n    <cit.>\n    For a smooth variety X over k, let I be the ideal of the diagonal in X \u00d7_k X, that is, I = \u27e8 f \u2297 1 - 1 \u2297 f \u27e9\u2286_X \u2297_k _X.\n    A k-linear map of sheaves h : _X \u2192_X is a differential operator of order m if and only if the linearization h: _X \u2297_k _X \u2192_X is annihilated by I^m+1.\n\nA map h is a differential operator of order m if and only if for all local sections f_0,f_1,\u2026, f_m of _X, we have [f_0,[f_1,[\u2026,[f_m,h]]]] = 0.\nA degree zero differential operator is _X-linear and thus is a section of _X.\nDifferential operators form a filtered sheaf of rings _X with a map _X \u2192_X from the inclusion of degree zero differential operators.\nAs a left or right _X-module, the sheaf _X is quasi-coherent.\n\nThe sheaf _X contains differential operators \u201cwith divided powers.\u201d For example, if \u2202 = d/dt is the usual derivative acting on k[t], the operator \u2202^q is divisible by q!, as \u2202^q t^n = q! nqt^n-q. Thus 1/q!\u2202^q: t^n \u21a6nqt^n-q makes sense, regardless of the characteristic of k.\nThe following proposition states that _X locally has a basis of such operators:\n\n<cit.> \n    Suppose X is a smooth variety and {x_1,\u2026, x_n}\u2286\u0393(X,_X) such that {dx_1,\u2026, dx_n} is a basis for \u03a9^1_X. Then as either a left or a right _X-module,\n    _X has a basis of the form \n    \n    {\u2202_1^(q_1)\u2202_2^(q_2)\u22ef\u2202_n^(q_n)| q_1,q_2,\u2026, q_n \u2265 0}\n\n    where \u2202_i^(q_i) are differential operators such that\n    \n        \n  * \u2202_i^(0) = 1 for all i;\n        \n  * the operators {\u2202_i^(1) = \u2202_i}_i=1^n are derivations dual to the 1-forms {dx_i};\n        \n  * \u2202_i^(q)\u2202_i^(q') = q+q'q\u2202_i^(q+q') for all i and q,q' \u2265 0;\n        \n  * the following commutator relations hold:\n        \n    [\u2202_i^(q_i), \u2202_j^(q_j)]    = 0,   [\u2202_i^(q_i),x_j]    = \n                    0     i \u2260 j\n    \u2202_i^(q_i - 1)    i = j .\n\n    \n\nWe should think of \u2202_i^(q) as 1/q!(d/dx_i)^q, and indeed the commutator relations imply \u2202_i^(q)(x_i^n) = nqx_i^n-q.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Frobenius twists and matrix subalgebras\n\n\n\nIn this section, assume that k has characteristic p > 0. \n\nConsider the setting of Proposition <ref>. The derivations {\u2202_i}_i=1^n do not generate the algebra _X over _X. Instead, they generate an associative algebra of finite type over _X, centralizing the pth power of any element of _X.  \nTo deal with rings of pth powers, we use the standard language of Frobenius twists.\nFor any scheme S of characteristic p, let F_S: S \u2192 S be the absolute Frobenius morphism on S, which is the identity on |S| and acts on functions by f \u21a6 f^p.\n\n\n    The Frobenius twist X^(1) of X\u2192 k is the base change X \u00d7_ k ( k, F_ k) of X along the absolute Frobenius of k.\n\nThe Frobenius twist fits into a diagram \n\n    X [rd] [r, \"Fr_X/k\"]     X^(1)[r] [d]     X [d] \n        k [r, \"F_ k\"]               k\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the composition X \u2192 X^(1)\u2192 X is the absolute Frobenius F_X of X.\nThe induced map Fr_X/k: X \u2192 X^(1) over k is called the relative Frobenius.\nWhen there is no risk of confusion, we will write Fr instead of Fr_X/k.\nIf X is a smooth variety over k, then Fr is a homeomorphism and the induced map Fr: _X^(1)\u2192 Fr_\u2217_X is an inclusion making Fr_\u2217_X a finite free _X^(1)-module of rank p^ X <cit.>.\nWe may identify the image of _X^(1) in _X with the Frobenius twist _X^(1) of the sheaf _X.\nWe will also write Fr^r: X \u2192 X^(r) to mean the r-fold composition of relative Frobenius maps X \u2192 X^(1)\u2192\u22ef\u2192 X^(r).\n\n\n    The subalgebra ^r_X is the centralizer of _X^(r) in _X.\n\n\n <cit.>\n    \n    If X is a smooth variety over k,\n    then the action of _X on _X induces an isomorphism ^r_X \u2192_X^(r)(Fr^r_\u2217_X)\n    and _X = \u22c3_r\u2265 0^r_X.\n\n\n    The map _X^r\u2192_X^(r)(Fr^r_\u2217_X) is injective.\n    For r \u2265 1, \n    Let I^(r) = \u27e8 f^p^r\u2297 1 - 1 \u2297 f^p^r\u27e9\u2286_X \u2297_k _X.\n    Since X is of finite type, the chains of ideals I \u2287 I^2 \u2287\u22ef and I \u2287 I^(1)\u2287 I^(2)\u2287\u22ef are cofinal.\n    Hence every _X^(r)-linear map of Fr^r_\u2217_X is a differential operator,\n    so ^r_X\u2192_X^(r)(Fr^r_\u2217_X) is surjective.\n    Cofinality also implies every differential operator is linear over some _X^(r), so _X = \u22c3_r\u2265 0^r_X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    The subalgebras ^r_X are Morita equivalent to _X^(r), realizing Katz's equivalence of _X-modules with stratified sheaves on X <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE GERSTENHABER-SCHACK COMPLEX\n\n\n\nLet k be any field. We now describe the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex for computing Hochschild cohomology <cit.>.\nThe construction begins with a poset J, a presheaf of k-algebras \u00c5 on J, and a presheaf of \u00c5-bimodules .\nLet N(J) be the nerve of the poset J in the sense of category theory: it is the simplicial complex with p-simplices the chains \u03c3 = (U_0 < \u22ef < U_i) for U_0,\u2026,U_i \u2208 J. Any such simplex \u03c3 has a maximal element max\u03c3 = U_i and a minimal element min\u03c3 = U_0. Then the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex is the double complex \nwith cochains \n\n    C^i,j(\u00c5, ) = \u220f_\u03c3\u2208 N(J)^i C^j(\u00c5(max\u03c3), (min\u03c3)),\n\nwhere C^\u2217(-,-)=_k(-^\u2297\u2217,-) are the usual Hochschild cochains.\nThe horizontal differential is the differential on simplicial cochains on N(J) with respect to the system of local coefficients \u03c3\u21a6 C^j(\u00c5(max\u03c3),(min\u03c3)).\nThe vertical differential is the Hochschild differential. Then Hochschild cohomology of (\u00c5,) is defined by\n\n    HH^*(\u00c5,) = H^*( C^\u2217,\u2217).\n\nIn case J is a single point, the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex coincides with the usual Hochschild complex of an associative algebra.\n\nWe now consider the standard filtration F^\u2113 C^i,j = 0 if i< \u2113 and F^\u2113 C^i,j = C^i,j if i \u2265\u2113.\nThe associated spectral sequence yields:\n\n    Let J be a poset, \u00c5 a presheaf of associative k-algebras on J, and  a presheaf of \u00c5-bimodules.\n    Consider the local system on N(J) with coefficients \n    \n    HH^j(\u00c5,)(\u03c3) = HH^j(\u00c5(max\u03c3),(min\u03c3)).\n\n    There is first-quadrant spectral sequence with E_2-page\n    \n    E_2^i,j = H^i(N(J), HH^j(\u00c5,))\n\n    converging to HH^i+j(\u00c5,).\n\n\nIn our situation, the algebra _X is the union of subalgebras ^r_X. The following Lemma relates Hochschild cohomology of ^r_X and _X.\n\n\n    Let J be a poset,\n    \u00c5 a presheaf of associative k-algebras on J with a complete filtration by subalgebras \u00c5^0\u2286\u00c5^1\u2286\u22ef\u2286\u00c5. Then for any presheaf of \u00c5-bimodules , there are short exact sequences \n    \n    0 \u2192 R^1 _r HH^m-1(\u00c5^r,) \u2192 HH^m(\u00c5,) \u2192_r HH^m(\u00c5,) \u2192 0\n\n    for all m \u2265 0.\n\n\n    Fix an i-simplex \u03c3\u2208 N(J),\n    and let U_0 = min\u03c3, U_i = max\u03c3.\n    Then we have \u00c5(U_i) = \u222a_r \u00c5^r(U_i).\n    Since k is a field, the maps \n    \n    _k(\u00c5(U_i)^\u2297 j, (U_0)) \n           \u2192_k(\u00c5^r+1(U_i)^\u2297 j,(U_0))\n           \u2192_k(\u00c5^r(U_i)^\u2297 j,(U_0))\n\n    are surjective for all j \u2265 0.\n    Hence, the sequence of complexes C^i,j(\u00c5^r,) satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition on cochains and \n    \n    C^i,j(\u00c5,) = _r C^i,j(\u00c5^r,).\n Now the Proposition follows from <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY OF DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS\n\n\nFor the rest of the paper, the field k is of characteristic p > 0 and X is a smooth variety over k. As X is separated, the intersection of two affine opens is an affine open. \nHence there exists a covering of X by nonempty open affines closed under finite intersections; let \ud835\udd18 be such a covering.\nWe will compute the cohomology of the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex for _X with respect to the poset \ud835\udd18. \nHere is a sketch of the argument: we will first compute HH^*(^r_X,_X) locally, then apply the spectral sequence of Proposition <ref> to compute HH^*(^r_X,_X).\nFinally, Lemma <ref> will relate HH^*(^r_X,_X) with HH^*(_X).\n\nGiven affine U, let (U) = \u0393(U,_U), and similarly for ^r, , etc..\n\n\n    Let V \u2286 U be smooth affine varieties over k. Then \n    the inclusion (V^(r)) \u2192(V) induces \n    \n    HH^0(^r(U), (V)) \u2245(V^(r))\n\n    and HH^m(^r(U), (V)) = 0 for all m > 0.\n\n\n    By Propsition <ref>, \n    the algebra ^r(U) is the matrix ring _(U^(r))((U)).\n    It is well-known that Hochschild cohomology is Morita-invariant.\n    Under the Morita equivalence ^r(U)\u2243(U^(r)), the ^r(U)-bimodule (V) is sent exactly to (V^(r)).\n    This is seen as follows: for affine U, the inclusion (U^(r)) \u2192(U) is split as (U^(r))-modules <cit.>.\n    If e \u2208^r(U) is the idempotent corresponding to the splitting, then it is easily checked that the map e(V)e \u2192_k((V^(r))) induces an isomorphism e (V)e \u2245(V^(r)).\n\n    Thus, it suffices to show the claim when r=0,\n    that is, to compute Hochschild cohomology of ((U),(V)). The claim is local, so we may assume that U has local coordinates x_1,\u2026, x_n such that {x_i \u2297 1 - 1 \u2297 x_i} generate the ideal of the diagonal in U \u00d7 U. \n    Let P_\u2217\u2192(U) be the Koszul complex for (U) as an (U)-bimodule corresponding to the regular sequence x_1,\u2026, x_n. Then HH^\u2217((U),(V)) is computed by the complex _(U)\u2297(U)(P_\u2217, (V)).   \n    Using the basis of Proposition <ref>, the complex above is the tensor product over (V) of the two-term complexes \n    \n    (V) \u27e8\u2202_i\u27e9[r,\"[x_i,-]\"] \n               (V)\u27e8\u2202_i\u27e9\n \n    for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\n    where (V)\u27e8 - \u27e9 means free divided power algebra. The differential (<ref>) is surjective with kernel (V). Now the K\u00fcnneth formula finishes the proof.\n\n\n\n    The complex constructed in the proof above coincides with the PD de Rham complex for a free divided power algebra. See <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n    For a smooth variety X over k,\n    there is an isomorphism\n    \n    HH^m(^r_X,_X) \u2245 H^m(X,_X^(r))\n\n    for all m \u2265 0\n    such that the following diagram commutes:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    HH^m(^r+1_X,_X) [r, \"\u223c\"] [d]\n                H^m(X,_X^(r+1)) [d, \"Fr\"] \n    \n            HH^m(^r_X,_X) [r, \"\u223c\"] \n                H^m(X,_X^(r))\n\n\n\n    Consider the spectral sequence of Proposition <ref> for (^r_X,_X). By Proposition <ref>,\n    for any pair V\u2286 U in \ud835\udd18,\n    we have HH^0(^r(U),(V)) = (V)^(r) and HH^j(^r(U),(V)) = 0 for j > 0. \n    Thus, the spectral sequence has E_2-page \n    \n    E_2^ij = \n                H^i(N(\ud835\udd18),_X^(r))     j = 0 \n    \n                0     j > 0,\n\n    and so collapses at E_2.\n    \n    We would like to relate N(\ud835\udd18), the nerve in the sense of category theory, to \u010cech cohomology with respect to \ud835\udd18.\n    Let N_\u010cech(\ud835\udd18) be the \u010cech nerve of \ud835\udd18.\n    As \ud835\udd18 is closed under intersection, Theorem 1.4 of <cit.> implies that the map N_\u010cech(\ud835\udd18) \u2192\ud835\udd18 sending (U_0,\u2026, U_i) \u2208\ud835\udd18^i+1 with nonempty intersection to U_0 \u2229\u22ef\u2229 U_i induces a homotopy equivalence N_\u010cech(\ud835\udd18) \u2192 N(\ud835\udd18).\n    This map induces \n    \n    H^i(N(\ud835\udd18),_X^(r)) \u2245 H^i(N_\u010cech(\ud835\udd18),_X^(r)) = \u021e^i(\ud835\udd18,_X^(r)).\n\n    The sheaf _X^(r) is quasi-coherent on X^(r)\n    and the r-fold relative Frobenius Fr^r: X \u2192 X^(r) is a homeomorphism, so _X^(r) is acyclic for every affine open subset of X.\n    As \ud835\udd18 consists of affine open subsets of X and is closed under intersection, we obtain \n    E_2^i,0 = H^i(X,_X^(r)). This proves the claim.\n    \n\n\n\n    Let k be a field of positive characteristic and X be a smooth variety over k.\n    Then there are short exact sequences \n    \n    0 \u2192 R^1_r H^m-1(X,_X^(r)) \u2192 HH^m(_X) \u2192_r H^m(X,_X^(r)) \u2192 0\n\n    for all m \u2265 0,\n    where the limit is taken over the sequence of relative Frobenius maps Fr: X^(r)\u2192 X^(r+1).\n\n\n    Combine Proposition <ref> with Lemma <ref>.\n\n\n\n    In <cit.>, Ogus shows that there is an exact sequence \n    \n    0 \u2192 R^1 _r H^m-1(X,_X^(r)) \u2192^m__X(_X,_X) \u2192_r H^m(X,_X^(r)) \u2192 0\n\n    for all m \u2265 0. The connection with Theorem <ref> is this: for any abelian category \ud835\udc9e and object C of \ud835\udc9e there is the Chern character ch_C: HH^*(\ud835\udc9e) \u2192^*_\ud835\udc9e(C,C) <cit.>.\n    When \ud835\udc9e = A for an an associative algebra A and C \u2208 A, the characteristic morphism is implemented by the morphism of Hochschild complexes C^*(A,A) \u2192 C^*(A,_k(C)).

Theorem <ref> implies that HH^0(_\ud835\udd38^1) = k, \n    \n    HH^1(_\ud835\udd38^1) \u2245 R^1 _r k[t^p^r],\n\n    and HH^m(_\ud835\udd38^1) = 0 when m > 1.\n    Let us compute R^1_r k[t^p^r].\n    The short exact sequence of diagrams \n    \n    0 \u2192{ k[t^p^r]}_r \u2192{k[t]}_r \u2192{k[t]/k[t^p^r]}_r \u2192 0\n\n    gives a medium-length exact sequence of derived inverse limits\n    \n    0 \u2192 k \u2192 k[t] \u2192_r k[t]/k[t^p^r] \u2192 R^1_r k[t^p^r] \u2192 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0.\n\n    Hence R^1 _r k[t^p^r] is identified with (_r k[t]/k[t^p^r])/k[t]. The space _r k[t]/k[t^p^r] embeds into kt as those power series which may be written as a formal sum f= \u2211_r=0^\u221e f_r for f_r \u2208 k[t^p^r].\n    The identification HH^1(D(X)) \u2245 R^1_r (X^(r)) sends such a power series f to the commutator with f, which is well-defined since every element of D(X) commutes with some (X^(r)).\n    This explains S. Paul Smith's observation from 1986 that taking the commutator with the series t + t^p + t^p^2 + \u22ef gives an outer derivation of D(\ud835\udd38_k^1) <cit.>.\n\n\n\n    Suppose that X is proper over k, so that H^m(X,_X) is finite-dimensional over k for all m\u2265 0. Pullback by Frobenius is a semilinar endomorphism of H^m(X,_X), and thus there is a canonical splitting\n    \n    H^m(X,_X) = H^m_n(X,_X) \u2295 H^m_s(X,_X)\n\n    into Fr-stable subspaces where the Frobenius acts nilpotently and as an isomorphism, respectively <cit.>.
