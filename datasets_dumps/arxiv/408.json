This is a well-known NP-hard problem that frequently arises in various applications. We focus on two convex relaxations, namely the RLT (Reformulation-Linearization Technique) relaxation and the SDP-RLT relaxation obtained by adding semidefinite constraints to the RLT relaxation. Both relaxations yield lower bounds on the optimal value of a quadratic program with box constraints. We present complete algebraic descriptions of the set of instances that admit exact RLT relaxations as well as those that admit exact SDP-RLT relaxations. We show that our \ndescriptions can be converted into algorithms for efficiently constructing instances with exact or inexact relaxations.\n\n\n\n\nAMS Subject Classification: 90C20, 90C22, 90C26\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n \n\nA quadratic program with box constraints is an optimization problem in which a possibly nonconvex quadratic function is minimized subject to lower and upper bounds on each variable:\n\n    (BoxQP)  \u2113^* = min_x \u2208^n{q(x): x \u2208 F},\n\nwhere \nq: ^n \u2192 and F \u2286^n are respectively given by\n\n    q(x) = 1/2 x^T Q x + c^T x,    F = {x \u2208^n: 0 \u2264 x \u2264 e }.\n\nHere, e \u2208^n denotes the vector of all ones. The parameters of the problem are given by the pair (Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n, where ^n denotes the set of n \u00d7 n real symmetric matrices. The optimal value is denoted by \u2113^* \u2208. Note that any quadratic program with finite lower and upper bounds on each variable can be easily transformed into the above form.  \n\n(BoxQP) is regarded as a \u201cfundamental problem\u201d in global optimization that appears in a multitude of applications (see, e.g., <cit.>). If Q is a positive semidefinite matrix, (BoxQP) can be solved in polynomial time\u00a0<cit.>. However, if Q is an indefinite or negative semidefinite matrix, then (BoxQP) is an NP-hard problem <cit.>. In fact, it is even NP-hard to approximate a local minimizer of (BoxQP)\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 RLT and SDP-RLT Relaxations\n\n\nBy using a simple \u201clifting\u201d idea, (BoxQP) can be equivalently reformulated as \n\n    (L-BoxQP)  \u2113^* = min_(x,X) \u22081/2\u27e8 Q, X \u27e9 + c^T x,\n\nwhere \u27e8 A, B \u27e9 = trace(A^T B) = \u2211_i=1^p \u2211_j=1^q A_ij B_ij for any A \u2208^p \u00d7 q and B \u2208^p \u00d7 q, and \n\n    = {(x,X) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: 0 \u2264 x \u2264 e,    X_ij = x_i x_j,    1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n}.\n\nSince (L-BoxQP) is an optimization problem with a linear objective function over a nonconvex feasible region, one can replace  by conv(), where conv(\u00b7) denotes the convex hull, without affecting the optimal value. Many convex relaxations of (BoxQP) arise from this reformulation by employing outer approximations of conv() using tractable convex sets. \n\nA well-known relaxation of conv() is obtained by replacing the nonlinear equalities X_ij = x_i x_j by the so-called McCormick inequalities\u00a0<cit.>, which gives rise to the RLT (Reformulation-Linearization Technique) relaxation of (BoxQP) (see, e.g., <cit.>):\n\n    (R)  \u2113^*_R = min_(x,X) \u2208^n \u00d7^n{1/2\u27e8 Q, X\u27e9 + c^T x: (x,X) \u2208_R},\n\nwhere \n\n    _R = {(x,X) \u2208^n \u00d7^n:[                              0                              \u2264                              x                              \u2264                              e;            max{x_i + x_j -1,0}                              \u2264                           X_ij                              \u2264 min{x_i,x_j},    1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n ]}.\n\n\nThe RLT relaxation (R) of (BoxQP) can be further strengthened by adding tighter semidefinite constraints\u00a0<cit.>, giving rise to the SDP-RLT relaxation:\n\n    (RS)  \u2113^*_RS = min_(x,X) \u2208^n \u00d7^n{1/2\u27e8 Q, X\u27e9 + c^T x: (x,X) \u2208_RS},\n\nwhere \n\n    _RS = {(x,X) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: (x,X) \u2208_R,    X - x x^T \u227d 0}.\n\n\nThe optimal value of each of the RLT and SDP-RLT relaxations, denoted by \u2113^*_R and \u2113^*_RS, respectively, yields a lower bound on the optimal value of (BoxQP). The SDP-RLT relaxation is clearly at least as tight as the RLT relaxation, i.e., \n\n    \u2113^*_R \u2264\u2113^*_RS\u2264\u2113^*.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Motivation and Contributions\n\n\nConvex relaxations play a fundamental role in the design of global solution methods for nonconvex optimization problems. In particular, one of the most prominent algorithmic approaches for globally solving nonconvex optimization problems is based on a branch-and-bound framework, in which the feasible region is systematically subdivided into smaller subregions and a sequence of subproblems is solved to obtain increasingly tighter lower and upper bounds on the optimal value in each subregion. The lower bounds in such a scheme are typically obtained by solving a convex relaxation. For instance, several well-known optimization solvers such as ANTIGONE\u00a0<cit.>, BARON\u00a0<cit.>, CPLEX\u00a0<cit.>, and GUROBI\u00a0<cit.> utilize convex relaxations for globally solving nonconvex quadratic programs.\n\nIn this paper, our main goal is to describe the set of instances of (BoxQP) that admit exact RLT relaxations (i.e., \u2113_R^* = \u2113^*) as well as those that admit exact SDP-RLT relaxations (i.e., \u2113_RS^* = \u2113^*). Such descriptions shed light on easier subclasses of a difficult optimization problem. In addition, we aim to develop efficient algorithms for constructing an instance of (BoxQP) that admits an exact or inexact relaxation. Such algorithms can be quite useful in computational experiments for generating instances of (BoxQP) for which a particular relaxation will have a predetermined exactness or inexactness guarantee.\n\nOur contributions are as follows.\n\n\n    \n  * By utilizing the recently proposed perspective on convex underestimators induced by convex relaxations\u00a0<cit.>, we  \n    establish several useful properties of each of the two convex underestimators associated with the RLT relaxation and the SDP-RLT relaxation. \n    \n  * We present two equivalent algebraic descriptions of the set of instances of (BoxQP) that admit exact RLT relaxations. The first description arises from the analysis of the convex underestimator induced by the RLT relaxation, whereas the second description is obtained by using linear programming duality. \n    \n  * By relying on the second description of the set of instances with an exact RLT relaxation, we propose an algorithm for efficiently constructing an instance of (BoxQP) that admits an exact RLT relaxation and another algorithm for constructing an instance with an inexact RLT relaxation.\n    \n  * We establish that strong duality holds and that primal and dual optimal solutions are attained for the SDP-RLT relaxation and its dual. By relying on this relation, we give an algebraic description of the set of instances of (BoxQP) that admit an exact SDP-RLT relaxation.\n    \n  * By utilizing this algebraic description, we propose an algorithm for constructing an instance of (BoxQP) that admits an exact SDP-RLT relaxation and another one for constructing an instance that admits an exact SDP-RLT relaxation but an inexact RLT relaxation.\n\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. We briefly review the literature in Section\u00a0<ref> and define our notation in Section\u00a0<ref>. We review the optimality conditions in Section\u00a0<ref>. We present several properties of the convex underestimators arising from the RLT and SDP-RLT relaxations in Section\u00a0<ref>. Section\u00a0<ref> focuses on the description of instances with exact RLT relaxations and presents two algorithms for constructing instances with exact and inexact RLT relaxations. SDP-RLT relaxations are treated in Section\u00a0<ref>, which includes an algebraic description of instances with exact SDP-RLT relaxations and two algorithms for constructing instances with different exactness guarantees. We present several numerical examples and a brief discussion in Section\u00a0<ref>. Finally, Section\u00a0<ref> concludes the paper. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Literature Review\n \n\nQuadratic programs with box constraints have been extensively studied in the literature. Since our focus is on convex relaxations in this paper, we will mainly restrict our review accordingly. \n\nThe set conv(), where  is given by (<ref>), has been investigated in several papers (see, e.g., \u00a0<cit.>). This is a nonpolyhedral convex set even for n = 1. However, it turns out that conv() is closely related to the so-called Boolean quadric polytope\u00a0<cit.> that arises in unconstrained binary quadratic programs, which can be formulated as an instance of (BoxQP)\u00a0<cit.>, and is given by conv(^-), where\n\n    ^- = {(x,z) \u2208^n \u00d7^n  2: x_i \u2208{0,1},     z_ij = x_i x_j,    1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n}.\n\nThe linear programming relaxation of conv(^-), denoted by _R^-, is given by\n\n    _R^- = {(x,z) \u2208^n \u00d7^n  2:[                              0                              \u2264                              x                              \u2264                              e;            max{x_i + x_j -1,0}                              \u2264                           z_ij                              \u2264 min{x_i,x_j},    1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n ]},\n\nwhich is very similar to _R, except that McCormick inequalities are only applied to 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n. In particular, _R^- = conv(^-) for n = 2\u00a0<cit.>. Padberg\u00a0<cit.> identifies several facets of conv(^-) and shows that the components of each vertex of _R^- are in the set {0,1/2,1}. Yajima and Fujie\u00a0<cit.> show how to extend the valid inequalities for ^- in\u00a0<cit.> to . Burer and Letchford\u00a0<cit.> extend this result further by observing that conv(^-) is the projection of conv() onto the \u201ccommon variables.\u201d They also give a description of the set of extreme points of conv(). We refer the reader to\u00a0<cit.> for further refinements and to\u00a0<cit.> for a computational procedure based on such valid inequalities. \n\nAnstreicher\u00a0<cit.> reports computational results illustrating that the SDP-RLT relaxation significantly improves the RLT relaxation and gives a theoretical justification of the improvement by comparing _R and _RS for n = 2. Anstreicher and Burer\u00a0<cit.> show that _RS = conv() if and only if n \u2264 2. In particular, this implies that the SDP-RLT relaxation of (BoxQP) is always exact for n \u2264 2.\n\nWe next briefly review the literature on exact convex relaxations. Several papers have identified conditions under which a particular convex relaxation of a class of optimization problems is exact. For quadratically constrained quadratic programs, we refer the reader to\u00a0<cit.> for various exactness conditions for second-order cone or semidefinite relaxations. Recently, a large family of convex relaxations of general quadratic programs was considered in a unified manner through induced convex underestimators and a general algorithmic procedure was proposed for constructing instances with inexact relaxations for various convex relaxations\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nIn this work, our focus is on algebraic descriptions and algorithmic constructions of instances of (BoxQP) that admit exact and inexact RLT and SDP-RLT relaxations. Therefore, our focus is similar to\u00a0<cit.>, which presented descriptions of such instances of standard quadratic programs for RLT and SDP-RLT relaxations, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Notation\n \n\n\nWe use ^n, ^m \u00d7 n, and ^n to denote the n-dimensional Euclidean space, the set of m \u00d7 n real matrices, and the space of n \u00d7 n real symmetric matrices, respectively.  We use 0 to denote the real number 0, the vector of all zeroes, as well as the matrix of all zeroes, which should always be clear from the context. We reserve e \u2208^n for the vector of all ones. All inequalities on vectors or matrices are componentwise. For A \u2208^n, we use A \u227d 0 (resp., A \u227b 0) to denote that A is positive semidefinite (resp., positive definite). For index sets \ud835\udd41\u2286{1,\u2026,m}, \ud835\udd42\u2286{1,\u2026,n}, x \u2208^n, and B \u2208^m \u00d7 n, we denote by x_\ud835\udd42\u2208^|\ud835\udd42| the subvector of x restricted to the indices in \ud835\udd42 and by B_\ud835\udd41\ud835\udd42\u2208^|\ud835\udd41|\u00d7|\ud835\udd42| the submatrix of B whose rows and columns are indexed by \ud835\udd41 and \ud835\udd42, respectively, where |\u00b7| denotes the cardinality of a finite set. We simply use x_j and Q_ij for singleton index sets. For any U \u2208^m \u00d7 n and V \u2208^m \u00d7 n, the trace inner product is denoted by \n\n    \u27e8 U, V \u27e9 = trace(U^T V) = \u2211_i=1^m \u2211_j = 1^n U_ij V_ij.\n\n\nFor an instance of (BoxQP) given by (Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n, we define\n\n    q(x)     =    1/2 x^T Q x + c^T x, \n    \n    F     =    {x \u2208^n: 0 \u2264 x \u2264 e}, \n    \u2113^*     =    min_x \u2208^n{q(x): x \u2208 F}, \n    \n    V     =    {x \u2208 F: x_j \u2208{0,1},    j = 1, \u2026, n}.\n\n\nFor a given instance of (BoxQP), note that q(x), F, \u2113^*, and V denote the objective function, the feasible region, the optimal value, and the set of vertices, respectively. For x\u0302\u2208 F, we define the following index sets:\n\n    \ud835\udd43    =    \ud835\udd43(x\u0302) = {j \u2208{1,\u2026,n}: x\u0302_j = 0}, \n    \ud835\udd39    =    \ud835\udd39(x\u0302) = {j \u2208{1,\u2026,n}: 0 < x\u0302_j < 1}, \n    \ud835\udd4c    =    \ud835\udd4c(x\u0302) = {j \u2208{1,\u2026,n}: x\u0302_j = 1}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 OPTIMALITY CONDITIONS\n \n\n\n\nIn this section, we review first-order and second-order optimality conditions for (BoxQP). \n\nLet x\u0302\u2208 F be a local minimizer of (BoxQP).\nBy the first-order optimality conditions, there exists (\u00fb, v\u0302) \u2208^n \u00d7^n such that \n\n    Q x\u0302 + c + \u00fb - v\u0302    =     0, \n    \u00fb_\ud835\udd43\u222a\ud835\udd39    =     0, \n    v\u0302_\ud835\udd39\u222a\ud835\udd4c    =     0, \n    \u00fb   \u2265    0, \n    v\u0302   \u2265    0.\n\nNote that \u00fb\u2208^n and v\u0302\u2208^n are the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the constraints x \u2264 e and x \u2265 0 in (BoxQP), respectively. \n\nFor a local minimizer x\u0302\u2208 F of (BoxQP), the second-order optimality conditions are given by \n\n    d^TQd \u2265 0,   \u2200  d \u2208 D(x\u0302),\n\nwhere D(x\u0302) is the set of feasible directions at x\u0302 at which the directional derivative of the objective function vanishes, i.e., \n\n    D(x\u0302) := {d \u2208^n: (Q x\u0302 + c)^T d = 0,    d_\ud835\udd43\u2265 0,    d_\ud835\udd4c\u2264 0}.\n\nNote, in particular, that \n\n    x\u0302\u2208 F is a local minimizer\u21d2 Q_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd39\u227d 0.\n\nIn fact, x\u0302\u2208 F is a local minimizer of (BoxQP) if and only if the first-order and second-order optimality conditions given by (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) and (<ref>), respectively, are satisfied (see, e.g., <cit.>). \n\n\n\n\u00a7 PROPERTIES OF RLT AND SDP-RLT RELAXATIONS\n \n\nGiven an instance of (BoxQP), recall that the RLT relaxation is given by\n\n    (R)  \u2113^*_R = min_(x,X) \u2208^n \u00d7^n{1/2\u27e8 Q, X\u27e9 + c^T x: (x,X) \u2208_R},\n\nwhere _R is given by (<ref>), and the SDP-RLT relaxation by \n\n    (RS)  \u2113^*_RS = min_(x,X) \u2208^n \u00d7^n{1/2\u27e8 Q, X\u27e9 + c^T x: (x,X) \u2208_RS},\n\nwhere _RS is given by (<ref>). \n\nEvery convex relaxation of a nonconvex quadratic program obtained through lifting induces a convex underestimator on the objective function over the feasible region\u00a0<cit.>. In this section, we introduce the convex underestimators induced by RLT and SDP-RLT relaxations and establish several properties of these underestimators. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Convex Underestimators\n \n\nIn this section, we introduce the convex underestimators induced by the RLT and SDP-RLT relaxations. Let us first define the following sets parametrized by x\u0302\u2208 F:\n\n    _R(x\u0302)     =    {(x,X) \u2208_R: x = x\u0302},   x\u0302\u2208 F, \n    _RS(x\u0302)     =    {(x,X) \u2208_RS: x = x\u0302},   x\u0302\u2208 F.\n\n\nFor each x\u0302\u2208 F, we clearly have {(x\u0302,x\u0302x\u0302^T)}\u2286_RS(x\u0302) \u2286_R(x\u0302) and \n\n    \u22c3_x\u0302\u2208 F_R(x\u0302) = _R,   \u22c3_x\u0302\u2208 F_RS(x\u0302) = _RS.\n\n\nNext, we define the following functions:\n\n    \u2113_R(x\u0302)     =    min_x \u2208^n,X \u2208^n{1/2\u27e8 Q, X \u27e9 + c^T x: (x,X) \u2208_R(x\u0302)},   x\u0302\u2208 F, \n    \u2113_RS(x\u0302)     =    min_x \u2208^n,X \u2208^n{1/2\u27e8 Q, X \u27e9 + c^T x: (x,X) \u2208_RS(x\u0302)},   x\u0302\u2208 F.\n\nNote that the functions \u2113_R(\u00b7) and \u2113_RS(\u00b7) return the best objective function value of the corresponding relaxation subject to the additional constraint that x = x\u0302. By\u00a0<cit.>, each of \u2113_R(\u00b7) and \u2113_RS(\u00b7) is a convex function over F satisfying the relations \n\n    \u2113_R(x\u0302) \u2264\u2113_RS(x\u0302) \u2264 q(x\u0302),   x\u0302\u2208 F,\n\nand \n\n    (R1)  \u2113^*_R     =    min_x \u2208 F\u2113_R(x), \n    (RS1)  \u2113^*_RS    =    min_x \u2208 F\u2113_RS(x).\n\nThe convex underestimators \u2113_R(\u00b7) and \u2113_RS(\u00b7) allow us to view the RLT and SDP-RLT relaxations in the original space ^n of (BoxQP) by appropriately projecting out the lifted variables X \u2208^n that appear in each of (R) and (RS). As such, (R1) and (RS1) can be viewed as \u201creduced\u201d formulations of the RLT relaxation and the SDP-RLT relaxation, respectively. \nIn the remainder of this manuscript, we will alternate between the two equivalent formulations (R) and (R1) for the RLT relaxation as well as (RS) and (RS1) for the SDP-RLT relaxation.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Properties of Convex Underestimators\n\n\nIn this section, we present several properties of the convex underestimators \u2113_R(\u00b7) and \u2113_RS(\u00b7) given by (<ref>) and (<ref>), respectively. \n\nFirst, we start with the observation that \u2113_R(\u00b7) has a very specific structure with a simple closed-form expression.\n\n \n\u2113_R(\u00b7) is a piecewise linear convex function on F given by \n\n    \u2113_R(x\u0302) = 1/2(\u2211_(i,j): Q_ij > 0 Q_ijmax{0, x\u0302_i + x\u0302_j - 1} + \u2211_(i,j): Q_ij < 0 Q_ijmin{x\u0302_i,x\u0302_j}) + c^T x\u0302,   x\u0302\u2208 F.\n\n\n\nFor each x\u0302\u2208 F, the relation (<ref>) follows from (<ref>) and (<ref>).\nIt follows that \u2113_R(\u00b7) is a piecewise linear convex function on F since it is given by the sum of a finite number of piecewise linear convex functions.\n\n\nIn contrast with \u2113_R(\u00b7) given by the optimal value of a simple linear programming problem with bound constraints, \u2113_RS(\u00b7) does not, in general, have a simple closed-form expression as it is given by the optimal value of a semidefinite programming problem. \n\nThe next result states a useful decomposition property regarding the sets _R(x\u0302) and _RS(x\u0302).\n\n \nFor any x\u0302\u2208 F,\n(x\u0302, X\u0302) \u2208_R(x\u0302) if and only if there exists M\u0302\u2208_R(x\u0302) such that X\u0302 = x\u0302x\u0302^T + M\u0302, where\n\n    _R(x\u0302) = {M \u2208^n: [                                                         M_ij                                                            \u2264      min{x\u0302_i - x\u0302_i x\u0302_j, x\u0302_j - x\u0302_i x\u0302_j},    i \u2208\ud835\udd39, j \u2208\ud835\udd39,;                                                         M_ij                                                            \u2265 max{-x\u0302_i x\u0302_j, x\u0302_i + x\u0302_j - 1 - x\u0302_i x\u0302_j},    i \u2208\ud835\udd39, j \u2208\ud835\udd39,;                                                         M_ij                                                            =                                              0,   otherwise. ]},\n\nwhere \ud835\udd39 is given by (<ref>). \nFurthermore, (x\u0302, X\u0302) \u2208_RS(x\u0302) if and only if M\u0302\u2208_RS(x\u0302), where \n\n    _RS(x\u0302) = {M \u2208^n: M \u2208_R(x\u0302),    M \u227d 0}.\n\n\n\nBoth assertions follow from (<ref>), (<ref>), (<ref>), (<ref>), and the decomposition X\u0302 = x\u0302x\u0302^T + M\u0302.     \n\n\nBy Lemma\u00a0<ref>, we remark that M_ij has a negative lower bound and a positive upper bound in (<ref>) if and only if i \u2208\ud835\udd39 and j \u2208\ud835\udd39. Therefore, for any x\u0302\u2208 and any (x\u0302,X\u0302) \u2208_R (and hence any (x\u0302,X\u0302) \u2208_RS), we obtain\n\n    X\u0302_ij = x\u0302_i x\u0302_j,    i \u2209\ud835\udd39,  or  j \u2209\ud835\udd39.\n\nThis observation yields the following result.\n\n \nFor any vertex v \u2208 F, _R(v) = _RS(v) = {(v,vv^T)}.    \n\n\nThe claim directly follows from (<ref>) since \ud835\udd39 = \u2205.   \n\n\nThe decomposition in Lemma\u00a0<ref> can be translated into the functions \u2113_R(\u00b7) and \u2113_RS(\u00b7).\n\n \nFor each x\u0302\u2208 F,\n\n    \u2113_R(x\u0302)     =     q(x\u0302) + 1/2min_M \u2208_R(x\u0302)\u27e8 Q, M \u27e9, \n    \u2113_RS(x\u0302)     =     q(x\u0302) + 1/2min_M \u2208_RS(x\u0302)\u27e8 Q, M \u27e9,\n\nwhere _R(x\u0302) and _RS(x\u0302) are given by (<ref>) and (<ref>), respectively. \n\n\nThe assertions directly follow from (<ref>), (<ref>), and Lemma\u00a0<ref>.    \n\n\nBy Lemma\u00a0<ref>, we can easily establish the following properties.\n\n \nLet x\u0302\u2208 F and let \ud835\udd39 = \ud835\udd39(x\u0302), where \ud835\udd39(x\u0302) is given by (<ref>). \n\n    \n  (i) \u2113_R(x\u0302) = q(x\u0302) if and only if x\u0302 is a vertex of F or Q_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd39 = 0.\n    \n  (ii) \u2113_RS(x\u0302) = q(x\u0302) if and only if x\u0302 is a vertex of F or Q_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd39\u227d 0.\n\n\n\nBy Lemma\u00a0<ref>, \u2113_R(x\u0302) = q(x\u0302) (resp., \u2113_RS(x\u0302) = q(x\u0302)) if and only if min_M \u2208_R(x\u0302)\u27e8 Q, M \u27e9 = 0 (resp., min_M \u2208_RS(x\u0302)\u27e8 Q, M \u27e9 = 0). The assertions now follow from Lemma\u00a0<ref>.   \n\n\n\n\nLemma\u00a0<ref> immediately gives rise to the following results about the underestimator \u2113_RS(\u00b7).\n\n \n\n    \n  (i) If Q \u227d 0, then \u2113_RS(x\u0302) = q(x\u0302) for each x\u0302\u2208 F.\n    \n  (ii) For any local or global minimizer x\u0302\u2208 F of (BoxQP), we have \u2113_RS(x\u0302) = q(x\u0302). \n\n\n\nIf Q \u227d 0, then Q_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd39\u227d 0 for each \ud835\udd39\u2286{1,\u2026,n}. Therefore, both assertions follow from Lemma\u00a0<ref>(ii) since Q_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd39\u227d 0 at any local or global minimizer of (BoxQP) by (<ref>).  \n\n\nCorollary\u00a0<ref>(i) in fact holds for SDP relaxations of general quadratic programs and a result similar to Corollary\u00a0<ref>(ii) was established for general quadratic programs with a bounded feasible region\u00a0<cit.>. We remark that Corollary\u00a0<ref>(ii) presents a desirable property of the SDP-RLT relaxation, which is a necessary condition for its exactness by (<ref>) and (<ref>). However, this condition, in general, is not sufficient.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 EXACT AND INEXACT RLT RELAXATIONS\n \n\nIn this section, we focus on instances of (BoxQP) that admit exact and inexact RLT relaxations. We first establish a useful property of the set of optimal solutions of RLT relaxations. Using this property, we present two equivalent but different algebraic descriptions of instances with exact RLT relaxations. By utilizing one of these descriptions, we present an algorithm for constructing instances of (BoxQP) with an exact RLT relaxation and another algorithm for constructing instances with an inexact RLT relaxation. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Optimal Solutions of RLT Relaxations\n\n\nIn this section, we present useful properties of the set of optimal solutions of RLT relaxations. Our first result establishes the existence of a minimizer of (R1) with a very specific structure. \n\n \nFor the RLT relaxation of any instance of (BoxQP), there exists an optimal solution x\u0302\u2208 F of (R1), where (R1) is given by (<ref>), such that  \nx\u0302_j \u2208{0,1/2,1} for each j = 1,\u2026,n.    \n\n\nLet x\u0302\u2208 F be an optimal solution of (R1), i.e.,  \u2113^*_R =\u2113_R(x\u0302). Suppose that there exists k \u2208{1,\u2026,n} such that x\u0302_k \u2209{0,1/2,1}. We will show that one can construct another x\u0303\u2208 F such that \u2113_R(x\u0303) = \u2113_R(x\u0302) = \u2113^*_R and x\u0303_j \u2208{0,1/2,1} for each j = 1,\u2026,n. \n\nLet \u03b1 = min{x\u0302_k,1 - x\u0302_k}\u2208 (0,1/2) and let \n\n    \u03b1_l     =    max{(max_j:min{x\u0302_j,1 - x\u0302_j}<\u03b1min{x\u0302_j,1 - x\u0302_j}),0}, \n    \u03b1_u     =    min{(min_j:min{x\u0302_j,1 - x\u0302_j}>\u03b1min{x\u0302_j,1 - x\u0302_j}),1/2},\n\nwith the usual conventions that the minimum and the maximum over the empty set are defined to be +\u221e and -\u221e, respectively. Note that 0 \u2264\u03b1_l < \u03b1 < \u03b1_u \u22641/2. Let us define the following index sets:\n\n    \ud835\udd40_1     =    {j \u2208{1,\u2026,n}: x\u0302_j = \u03b1}, \n    \ud835\udd40_2     =    {j \u2208{1,\u2026,n}: x\u0302_j = 1 - \u03b1}, \n    \ud835\udd40_3     =    {j \u2208{1,\u2026,n}: x\u0302_j \u2208 [0,\u03b1_l] \u222a [\u03b1_u,1 - \u03b1_u] \u222a [1 - \u03b1_l,1]}.\n\nNote that \ud835\udd40_1, \ud835\udd40_2, \ud835\udd40_3\nis a partition of the index set by the definitions of \u03b1_l and \u03b1_u, and we have k \u2208\ud835\udd40_1 \u222a\ud835\udd40_2. \nLet us define a direction d\u0302\u2208^n by \n\n    d\u0302_j = {[      1, j \u2208\ud835\udd40_1,;     -1, j \u2208\ud835\udd40_2,;      0, j \u2208\ud835\udd40_3. ].\n\nConsider x^\u03b2 = x\u0302 + \u03b2d\u0302. It is easy to verify that x^\u03b2\u2208 F for each \u03b2\u2208 [\u03b1_l - \u03b1,\u03b1_u - \u03b1]. We claim that \u2113_R(x^\u03b2) is a linear function of \u03b2 on this interval. By (<ref>), it suffices to show that each term is a linear function. \n\nFirst, let us focus on the term given by max{0, x^\u03b2_i + x^\u03b2_j - 1} = \nmax{0, x\u0302_i + x\u0302_j - 1 + \u03b2d\u0302_i + \u03b2d\u0302_j}, where i = 1,\u2026,n;\u00a0j = 1,\u2026,n. It suffices to show that the sign of x\u0302_i + x\u0302_j - 1 + \u03b2d\u0302_i + \u03b2d\u0302_j does not change for each \u03b2\u2208 [\u03b1_l - \u03b1,\u03b1_u - \u03b1] and for each i = 1,\u2026,n;\u00a0j = 1,\u2026,n. Clearly, x\u0302_i + x\u0302_j - 1 + \u03b2d\u0302_i + \u03b2d\u0302_j = x\u0302_i + x\u0302_j - 1 if {i,j}\u2286\ud835\udd40_3; or i \u2208\ud835\udd40_1, j \u2208\ud835\udd40_2; or i \u2208\ud835\udd40_2, j \u2208\ud835\udd40_1. For the remaining cases, it follows from the definitions of \ud835\udd40_1, \ud835\udd40_2, and \ud835\udd40_3 that\n\n\n    x\u0302_i + x\u0302_j - 1 + \u03b2d\u0302_i + \u03b2d\u0302_j \u2208{[                                    [2 \u03b1_l - 1, 2 \u03b1_u - 1],                                                 {i,j}\u2286\ud835\udd40_1,;                                    [1 - 2 \u03b1_u, 1 - 2 \u03b1_l],                                                 {i,j}\u2286\ud835\udd40_2,;     [\u03b1_l - 1,\u03b1_l + \u03b1_u - 1] \u222a [\u03b1_l + \u03b1_u - 1,0] \u222a [0,\u03b1_u],                        i \u2208\ud835\udd40_1, j \u2208\ud835\udd40_3;  or i \u2208\ud835\udd40_3, j \u2208\ud835\udd40_1,; [-\u03b1_u, 0] \u222a [0, 1 - \u03b1_l - \u03b1_u] \u222a [1 - \u03b1_l - \u03b1_u, 1 - \u03b1_l],                        i \u2208\ud835\udd40_2, j \u2208\ud835\udd40_3;  or i \u2208\ud835\udd40_3, j \u2208\ud835\udd40_2. ].\n\n\nOur claim now follows from 0 \u2264\u03b1_l < \u03b1_u \u22641/2. Therefore, max{0, x\u0302_i + x\u0302_j - 1 + \u03b2d\u0302_i + \u03b2d\u0302_j} is a linear function on \u03b2\u2208 [\u03b1_l - \u03b1,\u03b1_u - \u03b1] for each i = 1,\u2026,n;\u00a0 j = 1,\u2026,n.\n\n\nLet us now consider the term min{x^\u03b2_i,x^\u03b2_j} = min{x\u0302_i + \u03b2d\u0302_i,x\u0302_j + \u03b2d\u0302_j}. By the choice of d\u0302, it is easy to see that the order of the components of x^\u03b2 remains unchanged for each \u03b2\u2208 [\u03b1_l - \u03b1,\u03b1_u - \u03b1], i.e., if x\u0302_i \u2264x\u0302_j, then x\u0302_i + \u03b2d\u0302_i \u2264x\u0302_j + \u03b2d\u0302_j for each i = 1,\u2026,n;\u00a0 j = 1,\u2026,n. It follows that min{x\u0302_i + \u03b2d\u0302_i,x\u0302_j + \u03b2d\u0302_j} is a linear function on \u03b2\u2208 [\u03b1_l - \u03b1,\u03b1_u - \u03b1]. \n\nSince the third term in (<ref>) is also a linear function on \u03b2\u2208 [\u03b1_l - \u03b1,\u03b1_u - \u03b1], it follows that \u2113_R(x^\u03b2) is a linear function on [\u03b1_l - \u03b1,\u03b1_u - \u03b1]. Therefore, by the optimality of x\u0302 in (R1), \u2113_R(x^\u03b2) is a constant function on this interval. If \u03b1_l = 0 and \u03b1_u = 1/2, then the alternate optimal solution at each end of this interval satisfies the desired property. Otherwise, by moving to the solution at one of the end points with \u03b1_l > 0 or \u03b1_u < 1/2, one can repeat the same procedure in an iterative manner to arrive at an alternate optimal solution with the desired property. Note that this procedure is finite since either \u03b1_l strictly decreases or \u03b1_u strictly increases at each iteration. \n\n\nWe can utilize Proposition\u00a0<ref> to obtain the following result about the set of optimal solutions of (R).\n\n \nThere exists an optimal solution (x\u0302,X\u0302) \u2208^n \u00d7^n of the RLT relaxation (R) such that x\u0302_j \u2208{0,1/2,1} for each j = 1,\u2026,n and X\u0302_ij\u2208{0,1/2,1} for each i = 1,\u2026,n;\u00a0j = 1,\u2026,n such that \n\n    [ X\u0302_\ud835\udd43\ud835\udd43 X\u0302_\ud835\udd43\ud835\udd39 X\u0302_\ud835\udd43\ud835\udd4c; X\u0302_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd43 X\u0302_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd39 X\u0302_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd4c; X\u0302_\ud835\udd4c\ud835\udd43 X\u0302_\ud835\udd4c\ud835\udd39 X\u0302_\ud835\udd4c\ud835\udd4c ] = [             0             0             0;             0         X\u0302_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd39 1/2 e_\ud835\udd39 e_\ud835\udd4c^T;             0 1/2 e_\ud835\udd4c e_\ud835\udd39^T     e_\ud835\udd4c e_\ud835\udd4c^T ],   X\u0302_ij\u2208{0,1/2},    i \u2208\ud835\udd39,\u00a0j \u2208\ud835\udd39.\n\n\n\nBy Proposition\u00a0<ref>, there exists x\u0302\u2208 F such that \u2113^*_R =\u2113_R(x\u0302) and x\u0302_j \u2208{0,1/2,1} for each j = 1,\u2026,n.

Therefore, (x\u0302,X\u0302) is an optimal solution of (R) with the desired property.\n    \n\nThe next result follows from Corollary\u00a0<ref>.\n\n \nFor each vertex (x\u0302,X\u0302) \u2208_R, x\u0302_j \u2208{0,1/2,1} for each j = 1,\u2026,n and X\u0302_ij\u2208{0,1/2,1} for each i = 1,\u2026,n;\u00a0j = 1,\u2026,n.\n\n\nSince _R is a polytope, (x\u0302,X\u0302) \u2208_R is a vertex if and only if there exists a (Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n such that (x\u0302,X\u0302) \u2208_R is the unique optimal solution of (R). The assertion follows from Corollary\u00a0<ref>.  \n\n\nWe remark that Padberg\u00a0<cit.> established a similar result for the set _R^- given by (<ref>). Corollary\u00a0<ref> extends the same result to _R. In contrast with the proof of\u00a0<cit.>, which relies on linearly independent active constraints, our proof uses a specific property of the set of optimal solutions of the reduced formulation (R1). \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 First Description of Exact RLT Relaxations\n\n\nIn this section, we present our first description of the set of instances of (BoxQP) with an exact RLT relaxation. We start with a useful property of such instances. \n\n\n\n \nFor any instance of (BoxQP), the RLT relaxation is exact, i.e., \u2113^*_R = \u2113^*, if and only if there exists a vertex v \u2208 F such that v is an optimal solution of (R1), where (R1) is given by (<ref>).\n\n\nSuppose that \u2113^*_R = \u2113^*. Then, by (<ref>) and (<ref>), for any optimal solution x^* \u2208 F of (BoxQP), we have q(x^*) = \u2113^* = \u2113^*_R \u2264\u2113_R(x^*) \u2264 q(x^*) = \u2113^*, which implies that \u2113^*_R = \u2113_R(x^*) = q(x^*).\nBy Lemma\u00a0<ref>(i), either x^* is a vertex of F, in which case, we are done, or Q_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd39 = 0, where \ud835\udd39 is given by (<ref>). In the latter case, since x\u0302^*_\ud835\udd43 = 0 and x\u0302^*_\ud835\udd4c = e_\ud835\udd4c by (<ref>) and (<ref>), respectively, \nwe obtain\n\n    \u2113^*_R = \u2113^* = q(x^*) = 1/2 e_\ud835\udd4c^T Q_\ud835\udd4c\ud835\udd4c e_\ud835\udd4c + (x^*_\ud835\udd39)^T Q_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd4c e_\ud835\udd4c + c_\ud835\udd4c^T e_\ud835\udd4c + c_\ud835\udd39^T x^*_\ud835\udd39 = 1/2 e_\ud835\udd4c^T Q_\ud835\udd4c\ud835\udd4c e_\ud835\udd4c + c_\ud835\udd4c^T e_\ud835\udd4c,\n\nwhere the last equality follows from the identity Q_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd4c e_\ud835\udd4c + c_\ud835\udd39 = 0 by (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>). Therefore, for the vertex v \u2208 F given by v_j = 1 for each j \u2208\ud835\udd4c and v_j = 0 for each j \u2208\ud835\udd43\u222a\ud835\udd39 = 0, we obtain q(v) = \u2113^* = \u2113_R(v) by Lemma\u00a0<ref>(i).\n\nConversely, if there exists a vertex v \u2208 F such that \u2113_R(v) = \u2113^*_R, then we have \u2113^* \u2264 q(v) = \u2113_R(v) = \u2113^*_R by Lemma\u00a0<ref>(i). The assertion follows from (<ref>).   \n\n\nProposition\u00a0<ref> presents an important property of the set of instances of (BoxQP) with exact RLT relaxations in terms of the set of optimal solutions and gives rise to the following corollary.\n\n \nFor any instance of (BoxQP), the RLT relaxation is exact if and only if there exists a vertex v \u2208 F such that (v,vv^T) is an optimal solution of (R). Furthermore, in this case, v is an optimal solution of (BoxQP).   \n\n\nThe assertion directly follows from Proposition\u00a0<ref>, Lemma\u00a0<ref>(i), and Corollary\u00a0<ref>.    \n\n\nBy Corollary\u00a0<ref>, if the set of optimal solutions of (BoxQP) does not contain a vertex, then the RLT relaxation is inexact. Note that if q(\u00b7) is a concave function, then the set of optimal solutions of (BoxQP) contains at least one vertex. However, this is an NP-hard problem (see, e.g.,\u00a0<cit.>), which implies that the RLT relaxation can be inexact even if the set of optimal solutions of (BoxQP) contains at least one vertex. The next example illustrates that the RLT relaxation can be inexact even if every optimal solution of (BoxQP) is a vertex.\n\n \nConsider an instance of (BoxQP) with\n\n    Q = [ -1 -2; -2  1 ],    c = [ 1; 1 ].\n\nNote that\n\n    q(x) = 1/2(-x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 4 x_1 x_2) + x_1 + x_2 = 1/2(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 + x_2) (1 - x_1),\n\nwhich implies that q(x) \u2265 0 for each x \u2208 F and q(x) = 0 if and only if x \u2208{0,e}. Therefore, \u2113^* = 0 and the set of optimal solution is given by {0,e}, which consists of two vertices of F. However, for x\u0302 = 1/2e \u2208^2, it is easy to verify that \u2113_R(x\u0302) = -1/4 < \u2113^*. In fact, \u2113^*_R = \u2113_R(x\u0302) = -1/4 and \u2113_R(x) > \u2113_R(x\u0302) for each x \u2208 F \\{x\u0302}. Figure\u00a0<ref> illustrates the functions q(\u00b7) and \u2113_R(\u00b7). \n\n\n\n\nWe next present our first description of the set of instances that admit an exact RLT relaxation. \nTo that end, let us define\n\n    _R = {(Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: \u2113^* = \u2113^*_R}.\n\ni.e., _R denotes the set of all instances of (BoxQP) that admit an exact RLT relaxation. \nFor a given x\u0302\u2208 F, let us define\n\n    _R(x\u0302) = {(Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: \u2113_R(x\u0302) = \u2113^*_R} = {(Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: \u2113_R(x\u0302) \u2264\u2113_R(x),    x \u2208 F},\n\ni.e., _R(x\u0302) denotes the set of instances of (BoxQP) such that x\u0302 is a minimizer of (R1), where (R1) is given by (<ref>). \nBy (<ref>), it is easy to see that _R(x\u0302) is a convex cone for each x\u0302\u2208 F. Our next result provides an algebraic description of the set _R.\n\n \nLet V \u2282 F denote the set of vertices of F given by (<ref>) and let V^+ = {x \u2208 F: x_j \u2208{0,1/2,1},    j = 1,\u2026,n}. Then, _R defined as in (<ref>) is given by the union of a finite number of polyhedral cones and admits the following description:\n\n    _R = \u22c3_v \u2208 V_R(v) = \u22c3_v \u2208 V(\u22c2_x\u0302\u2208 V^+{(Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: \u2113_R(v) \u2264\u2113_R(x\u0302)}).\n\n\n\nBy Proposition\u00a0<ref>, the RLT relaxation is exact if and only if there exists a vertex v \u2208 F such that \u2113_R(v) = \u2113^*_R,  \nwhich, together with (<ref>), leads to the first equality in (<ref>). By Proposition\u00a0<ref>, the set V_+ contains at least one minimizer of \u2113_R(\u00b7), \nwhich implies the second equality in (<ref>). _R is the union of a finite number of polyhedral cones since \u2113_R(x) is a linear function of (Q,c) for each fixed x \u2208 F by Lemma\u00a0<ref> and V^+ is a finite set.\n\n\nFor each v \u2208 V, we remark that Proposition\u00a0<ref> gives a description of _R(v) using 3^n linear inequalities since |V^+| = 3^n. In fact, for each v \u2208 V, the convexity of \u2113_R(\u00b7) on F implies that it suffices to consider only those x\u0302\u2208 V_+ such that x\u0302_j \u2208{0,1/2} for j \u2208\ud835\udd43(v) and x\u0302_j \u2208{1/2,1} for j \u2208\ud835\udd4c(v), where \ud835\udd43(v) and \ud835\udd4c(v) are given by (<ref>) and (<ref>), respectively, which implies a simpler description  of _R with 2^n inequalities. Due to the exponential number of such inequalities, this description is not very useful for efficiently checking if a particular instance of (BoxQP) admits an exact RLT relaxation. Similarly, this description cannot be used easily for constructing such an instance of (BoxQP). In the next section, we present an alternative description of _R using linear programming duality, which gives rise to algorithms for efficiently constructing instances of (BoxQP) with exact or inexact RLT relaxations.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 An Alternative Description of Exact RLT Relaxations\n \n\n\n\nIn this section, our main goal is to present an alternative description of the set _R using duality. \n\nRecall that the RLT relaxation is given by\n\n    (R)  \u2113^*_R = min_(x,X) \u2208^n \u00d7^n{1/2\u27e8 Q, X\u27e9 + c^T x: (x,X) \u2208_R},\n\nwhere, _R given by (<ref>), can be expressed in the following form:\n\n    _R = {(x,X) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: [                      x                      \u2264                      e;                      x                      \u2265                      0; X - xe^T - ex^T + ee^T                      \u2265                      0;              -X + ex^T                      \u2265                      0;                      X                      \u2265                      0 ]}.\n\n\nBy defining dual variables (u,v,W,Y,Z) \u2208^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7 n\u00d7^n corresponding to each of the five constraints in (<ref>), respectively, the dual problem of (R) is given by\n\n    [                                  (R-D) max_(u,v,W,Y,Z) \u2208^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7 n\u00d7^n                   -e^T u - 1/2 e^T W e                                                                              ;                                                                          s.t.                                                                                                                     ;                                                                                                 -u + v - W e + Y^T e                                      =                                      c;                                                                                                      W - Y - Y^T + Z                                      =                                      Q;                                                                                                                    u                                      \u2265                                      0;                                                                                                                    v                                      \u2265                                      0;                                                                                                                    W                                      \u2265                                      0;                                                                                                                    Y                                      \u2265                                      0;                                                                                                                    Z                                      \u2265                                     0. ]\n\n\nNote that the variables (W,Y,Z) \u2208^n \u00d7^n \u00d7 n\u00d7^n in (R-D) are scaled by a factor of 1/2.

Conversely, any (Q,c) \u2208_R can be generated by Algorithm\u00a0<ref> with appropriate choices of \ud835\udd43\u2286{1,\u2026,n} and (\u00fb,v\u0302,\u0174,\u0176,\u1e90) \u2208^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7 n\u00d7^n.  \n\n\nLet \ud835\udd43\u2286{1,\u2026,n} and define \ud835\udd4c = {1,\u2026,n}\\\ud835\udd43. Let v \u2208 F be the vertex given by v_j = 0,\u00a0j \u2208\ud835\udd43 and v_j = 1,\u00a0j \u2208\ud835\udd4c. It is easy to verify that (\u00fb,v\u0302,\u0174,\u0176,\u1e90) \u2208^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7 n\u00d7^n and (x\u0302,X\u0302) = (v,vv^T) satisfy the hypotheses of Corollary\u00a0<ref>, which establishes the first assertion. The second assertion also follows from Corollary\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\nBy considering all possible subsets \ud835\udd43\u2286{1,\u2026,n}, Proposition\u00a0<ref> yields an alternative characterization of _R given by the union of 2^n polyhedral cones (cf.\u00a0Proposition\u00a0<ref>). In contrast with the description in Proposition\u00a0<ref>, this alternative description enables us to easily construct an instance of (BoxQP) with a known optimal vertex and an exact RLT relaxation (cf.\u00a0Corollary\u00a0<ref>). Note, however, that even the alternative description is not very useful for effectively checking if (Q,c) \u2208_R due to the exponential number of polyhedral cones.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Construction of Instances with Inexact RLT Relaxations\n \n\nIn this section, we propose an algorithm for constructing instances of (BoxQP) with an inexact RLT relaxation. Algorithm\u00a0<ref> is based on constructing a dual optimal solution of (R-D) such that no feasible solution of the form (v, vv^T) \u2208_R can be an optimal solution of (R), where v \u2208 F is a vertex.\n\n\n\nThe next result establishes that the output from Algorithm\u00a0<ref> is an instance of (BoxQP) with an inexact RLT relaxation.\n\n \nAlgorithm\u00a0<ref> returns (Q,c) \u2209_R, where _R is defined as in (<ref>).    \n\n\nConsider the partition (\ud835\udd43,\ud835\udd39,\ud835\udd4c) of the index set {1,\u2026,n} as defined in Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, where \ud835\udd39\u2260\u2205. Clearly, (\u00fb,v\u0302,\u0174,\u0176,\u1e90) \u2208^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7 n\u00d7^n is a feasible solution of (R-D). We will construct a feasible solution (x\u0302, X\u0302) \u2208^n \u00d7^n of (R) that satisfies the optimality conditions of Lemma\u00a0<ref>. \n\nConsider the following solution (x\u0302, X\u0302) \u2208^n \u00d7^n:\n\n    x\u0302_\ud835\udd43 = 0,   x\u0302_\ud835\udd39 = 1/2 e_\ud835\udd39  x\u0302_\ud835\udd4c = e_\ud835\udd4c,\n\nand\n\n    [ X\u0302_\ud835\udd43\ud835\udd43 X\u0302_\ud835\udd43\ud835\udd39 X\u0302_\ud835\udd43\ud835\udd4c; X\u0302_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd43 X\u0302_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd39 X\u0302_\ud835\udd39\ud835\udd4c; X\u0302_\ud835\udd4c\ud835\udd43 X\u0302_\ud835\udd4c\ud835\udd39 X\u0302_\ud835\udd4c\ud835\udd4c ] = [             0             0             0;             0             0 1/2 e_\ud835\udd39 e_\ud835\udd4c^T;             0 1/2 e_\ud835\udd4c e_\ud835\udd39^T     e_\ud835\udd4c e_\ud835\udd4c^T ].\n\nBy Lemma\u00a0<ref>, (x\u0302, X\u0302) \u2208_R. By Steps 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, it is easy to verify that (<ref>), (<ref>), (<ref>), (<ref>), and (<ref>) are respectively satisfied. Therefore, by Lemma\u00a0<ref>, we conclude that (x\u0302, X\u0302) is an optimal solution of (R) and (\u00fb,v\u0302,\u0174,\u0176,\u1e90) is an optimal solution of (R-D).\n\nWe next argue that the RLT relaxation is inexact. Let (x\u0303, X\u0303) \u2208_R be an arbitrary optimal solution of (R). By Lemma\u00a0<ref>, (x\u0303, X\u0303) and (\u00fb,v\u0302,\u0174,\u0176,\u1e90) satisfy the conditions (<ref>), (<ref>), (<ref>), (<ref>), and (<ref>). \nBy (<ref>) and Step 8 of Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, we obtain X\u0303_kk = 0 since \u1e90_kk > 0.  \nSince \u0174_kk > 0 by Step 6 of Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, the relation (<ref>) implies that X\u0303_kk - 2 x\u0303_k + 1 = 0, i.e., x\u0303_k = 1/2 since X\u0303_kk = 0. By Lemma\u00a0<ref>, we conclude that x\u0303_k = 1/2 for each optimal solution (x\u0303, X\u0303) \u2208_R of (R). By Corollary\u00a0<ref>, we conclude that (Q,c) \u2209_R.\n\n\nAlgorithm\u00a0<ref> can be used to generate an instance of (BoxQP) with an inexact RLT relaxation. \nNote that Algorithm\u00a0<ref> constructs an instance (Q,c) with the property that at least one component x\u0302_k is fractional at every optimal solution (x\u0302, X\u0302) of (R), which is sufficient for having an inexact RLT relaxation by Corollary\u00a0<ref>. However, this condition may not be necessary for an inexact RLT relaxation. In particular, note that an instance generated by Algorithm\u00a0<ref> cannot have a concave objective function since Q_kk = \u0174_kk + \u1e90_kk > 0. On the other hand, for the specific instance (Q,c) \u2208^3 \u00d7^3 in\u00a0<cit.> given by Q = 1/3ee^T - I, where I \u2208^3 denotes the identity matrix, and c = 0, the objective function is concave and the optimal value is given by \u2113^* = -1/3, which is attained at any vertex that has exactly one component equal to 1. For x\u0302 = 1/2e \u2208^3, we have \u2113_R(x\u0302) = -1/2 < -1/3 = \u2113^* by Lemma\u00a0<ref>, which implies that the RLT relaxation is inexact on this instance. Therefore, in contrast with Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, we conclude that Algorithm\u00a0<ref> may not necessarily generate all possible instances (Q,c) \u2209_R.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 EXACT AND INEXACT SDP-RLT RELAXATIONS\n \n\nIn this section, we focus on the set of instances of (BoxQP) that admit exact and inexact SDP-RLT relaxations. We give a complete algebraic description of the set of instances of (BoxQP) that admit an exact SDP-RLT relaxation. In addition, we develop an algorithm for constructing such an instance of (BoxQP) as well as for constructing an instance of (BoxQP) with an exact SDP-RLT relaxation but an inexact RLT relaxation. \n\nSimilar to the RLT relaxation, let us define\n\n    _RS = {(Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: \u2113^* = \u2113_RS},\n\ni.e., _RS denotes the set of all instances of (BoxQP) that admit an exact SDP-RLT relaxation. \nBy (<ref>), the SDP-RLT relaxation of any instance of (BoxQP) is at least as tight as the RLT relaxation. It follows that \n\n    _R \u2286_RS,\n\nwhere _R is given by (<ref>). \n\nBy Corollary\u00a0<ref> and (<ref>), we clearly have (Q,c) \u2208_RS whenever Q \u227d 0. Furthermore, the SDP-RLT relaxation is always exact (i.e., _RS = ^n \u00d7^n) if and only if n \u2264 2\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nFor the RLT relaxation, Proposition\u00a0<ref> established the existence of an optimal solution of the RLT relaxation with a particularly simple structure. This observation enabled us to characterize the set of instances of (BoxQP) with an exact RLT relaxation as the union of a finite number polyhedral cones (see Proposition\u00a0<ref>). In contrast, the next result shows that the set of optimal solutions of the SDP-RLT relaxation cannot have such a simple structure.\n\n \n For any x\u0302\u2208 F, there exists an instance (Q,c) of (BoxQP) such that x\u0302 is the unique optimal solution of (RS1), where (RS1) is given by (<ref>), and (Q,c) \u2208_RS. \n\n\n For any x\u0302\u2208 F, consider an instance of (BoxQP) with (Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n, where Q \u227b 0 and c = -Q x\u0302. We obtain q(x) = 1/2((x - x\u0302)^T Q (x - x\u0302) - x\u0302^T Q x\u0302). Since Q \u227b 0, x\u0302 is the unique unconstrained minimizer of q(x). By Lemma\u00a0<ref>, since Q \u227b 0, we have \u2113_RS(x) = q(x) for each x \u2208 F, which implies that \u2113^* = q(x^*) = \u2113_RS(x^*) = \u2113^*_RS. It follows that (Q,c) \u2208_RS. The uniqueness follows from the strict convexity of \u2113_RS(\u00b7) since \u2113_RS(x) = q(x) for each x \u2208 F.   \n\n   \nIn the next section, we rely on duality theory to obtain a description of the set _RS.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The Dual Problem\n\n\nIn this section, we present the dual of the SDP-RLT relaxation given by (RS) and establish several useful properties. \n\nRecall that the SDP-RLT relaxation is given by\n\n    (RS)  \u2113^*_RS = min_(x,X) \u2208^n \u00d7^n{1/2\u27e8 Q, X\u27e9 + c^T x: (x,X) \u2208_RS},\n\nwhere _RS is given by (<ref>). \n\nBy the Schur complement property, we have\n\n    X - x x^T \u227d 0 \u27fa[   1 x^T;   x   X ]\u227d 0,\n\nwhich implies that (RS) can be formulated as a linear semidefinite programming problem. \n\nBy using the same set of dual variables (u,v,W,Y,Z) \u2208^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7 n\u00d7^n as in (R-D) corresponding to the common constraints in _R and _RS (see (<ref>)), and defining the dual variable \n\n    [   \u03b2 h^T;   h   H ]\u2208^n+1,\n\nwhere \u03b2\u2208, h \u2208^n, and H \u2208^n, corresponding to the additional semidefinite constraint in (<ref>), the dual problem of (RS) is given by \n\n    [                                                (RS-D) max_(u,v,W,Y,Z,\u03b2,h,H) \u2208^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7 n\u00d7^n \u00d7\u00d7^n \u00d7^n                           -e^T u - 1/2 e^T W e - 1/2\u03b2                                                                                                            ;                                                                                                        s.t.                                                                                                                                                                  ;                                                                                                                                          -u + v - W e + Y^T e + h                                                     =                                                     c;                                                                                                                                               W - Y - Y^T + Z + H                                                     =                                                     Q;                                                                                                                                                                 u                                                     \u2265                                                     0;                                                                                                                                                                 v                                                     \u2265                                                     0;                                                                                                                                                                 W                                                     \u2265                                                     0;                                                                                                                                                                 Y                                                     \u2265                                                     0;                                                                                                                                                                 Z                                                     \u2265                                                     0;                                                                                                                                              [   \u03b2 h^T;   h   H ]                                                     \u227d                                                    0. ]\n\n\nIn contrast with linear programming, stronger assumptions are needed to guarantee strong duality in semidefinite programming.

Furthermore, in this case, x\u0302 is an optimal solution of (BoxQP).\n\n\nSuppose that (Q,c) \u2208_RS. Let x\u0302\u2208 F be an optimal solution of (BoxQP). By Corollary\u00a0<ref>(ii), we obtain \u2113^*_RS = \u2113^* = q(x\u0302) = \u2113_RS(x\u0302). Therefore, x\u0302 is an optimal solution of (RS1) given by (<ref>). Let (x\u0302, X\u0302) = (x\u0302, x\u0302x\u0302^T) \u2208_RS. We obtain 1/2\u27e8 Q, X\u0302\u27e9 + c^T x\u0302 = q(x\u0302) = \u2113^*_RS, which implies that (x\u0302, x\u0302x\u0302^T) is an optimal solution of (RS). The claim follows from Lemma\u00a0<ref>. \n\nFor the reverse implication, note that (x\u0302, X\u0302) = (x\u0302, x\u0302x\u0302^T) is an optimal solution of (RS) by Lemma\u00a0<ref>. By a similar argument and using (<ref>), we obtain \u2113^* \u2264 q(x\u0302) = \u2113^*_RS\u2264\u2113^*, which implies that \u2113^*_RS = \u2113^*, or equivalently, that (Q,c) \u2208_RS. \n\nThe second assertion follows directly from the previous arguments.\n\n\nIn the next section, by relying on Proposition\u00a0<ref>, we propose two algorithms to construct instances of (BoxQP) with different exactness guarantees. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Construction of Instances with Exact SDP-RLT Relaxations\n\n\nIn this section, we present an algorithm for constructing instances of (BoxQP) with an exact SDP-RLT relaxation. Similar to Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, Algorithm\u00a0<ref> is based on designating x\u0302\u2208 F and constructing an appropriate dual feasible solution that satisfies optimality conditions together with (x\u0302,x\u0302x\u0302^T) \u2208_RS.\n\n\n\nThe next proposition establishes the correctness of Algorithm\u00a0<ref>.\n\n \nAlgorithm\u00a0<ref> returns (Q,c) \u2208_RS, where _RS is defined as in (<ref>). Conversely, any (Q,c) \u2208_RS can be generated by Algorithm\u00a0<ref> with appropriate choices of x\u0302\u2208 F and (\u00fb,v\u0302,\u0174,\u0176,\u1e90,\u03b2\u0302,\u0125,\u0124) \u2208^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7 n\u00d7^n \u00d7\u00d7^n \u00d7^n.    \n\n\nSince \u0124\u227d 0, it follows from Steps 8 and 9 of Algorithm\u00a0<ref> that \n\n    [  \u03b2\u0302 \u0125^T;   \u0125   \u0124 ] = [ x\u0302^T;   -I ]\u0124[ x\u0302^T;   -I ]^T \u227d 0.\n\nTherefore, (\u00fb,v\u0302,\u0174,\u0176,\u1e90,\u03b2\u0302,\u0125,\u0124) \u2208^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7^n \u00d7 n\u00d7^n \u00d7\u00d7^n \u00d7^n is a feasible solution of (RS-D). Furthermore, the identity in (<ref>) also implies that\n\n    \u27e8[      1   x\u0302^T;     x\u0302 x\u0302x\u0302^T ] , [  \u03b2\u0302 \u0125^T;   \u0125   \u0124 ]\u27e9 = [  1; x\u0302 ]^T [  \u03b2\u0302 \u0125^T;   \u0125   \u0124 ][  1; x\u0302 ] = 0.\n\nIt is easy to verify that the conditions of Lemma\u00a0<ref> are satisfied with (x\u0302, X\u0302) = (x\u0302,x\u0302x\u0302^T) \u2208_RS. Both assertions follow from Proposition\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\nBy Proposition\u00a0<ref>, we conclude that _RS is given by the union of infinitely many convex cones each of which can be represented by semidefinite and linear constraints.\n\nSimilar to Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, we remark that Algorithm\u00a0<ref> can be utilized to generate an instance of (BoxQP) with an exact SDP-RLT relaxation such that any designated feasible solution x\u0302\u2208 F is an optimal solution of (BoxQP).\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Construction of Instances with Exact SDP-RLT and Inexact RLT Relaxations\n\n\nRecall that the SDP-RLT relaxation of any instance of (BoxQP) is at least as tight as the RLT relaxation.  In this section, we present another algorithm for constructing instances of (BoxQP) that admit an exact SDP-RLT relaxation but an inexact RLT relaxation, i.e., an instance in _RS\\_R (cf.\u00a0(<ref>)). In particular, this algorithm can be used to construct instances of (BoxQP) such that the SDP-RLT relaxation not only strengthens the RLT relaxation, but also yields an exact lower bound. \n\nNote that Algorithm\u00a0<ref> is capable of constructing all instances of (BoxQP) in the set _RS. On the other hand, if one chooses x\u0302\u2208 V and \u0124 = 0 in Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, which, in turn, would imply that \u0125 = 0 and \u03b2\u0302= 0, it is easy to verify that the choices of the remaining parameters satisfy the conditions of Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, which implies that the resulting instance would already have an exact RLT relaxation, i.e., (Q,c) \u2208_R. \n\nIn this section, we present Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, where we use a similar idea as in Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, i.e., we aim to construct an instance of (BoxQP) such that (x\u0302,x\u0302x\u0302^T) is the unique optimal solution of (RS), where x\u0302\u2208 F \\ V.\n\n\n\nNote that Algorithm\u00a0<ref> and Algorithm\u00a0<ref> are almost identical, except that, in Step 7, we require that \u0124\u227b 0 in Algorithm\u00a0<ref> as opposed to \u0124\u227d 0 in Algorithm\u00a0<ref>. The next result establishes that the output from Algorithm\u00a0<ref> is an instance of (BoxQP) with an exact SDP-RLT but inexact RLT relaxation.\n\n \nAlgorithm\u00a0<ref> returns (Q,c) \u2208_RS\\_R, where _R and _RS are defined as in (<ref>) and (<ref>), respectively.  \n\n\nBy the observation preceding the statement, it follows from Propositions\u00a0<ref> and <ref> that (Q,c) \u2208_RS and that (x\u0302,x\u0302x\u0302^T) is an optimal solution of (RS). First, we show that this is the unique optimal solution of (RS). Suppose, for a contradiction, that there exists another optimal solution (x\u0303, X\u0303) \u2208_RS. Note that, for any A \u227d 0 and B \u227d 0, \u27e8 A, B \u27e9 = 0 holds if and only if AB = 0. Therefore, it follows from (<ref>) that \u0125 - \u0124x\u0303 = 0. Since \u0124\u227b 0, we obtain x\u0303 = x\u0302 by Step 8. By (<ref>), we obtain\n\n    \u27e8[    1 x\u0302^T;   x\u0302   X\u0303 ] , [  \u03b2\u0302 \u0125^T;   \u0125   \u0124 ]\u27e9 = \u27e8[    1 x\u0302^T;   x\u0302   X\u0303 ] , [ x\u0302^T;   -I ]\u0124[ x\u0302^T;   -I ]^T \u27e9 = \u27e8\u0124, X\u0302 - x\u0302x\u0302^T \u27e9 = 0.\n\nSince \u0124\u227b 0 by Step 7 and X\u0302 - x\u0302x\u0302^T \u227d 0, it follows that X\u0303 = x\u0302x\u0302^T, which contradicts our assumption. It follows that (x\u0302,x\u0302x\u0302^T) is the unique optimal solution of (RS), or equivalently, that x\u0302 is the unique optimal solution of (RS1) given by (<ref>). By Proposition\u00a0<ref> and (<ref>), we conclude that (Q,c) \u2208_RS and that x\u0302\u2208 F \\ V is the unique optimal solution of (BoxQP). By Corollary\u00a0<ref>, (Q,c) \u2209_R, which completes the proof.\n\n\nAlgorithm\u00a0<ref> can be used to construct an instance in the set _R \\_RS. In particular, it is worth noticing that the family of instances used in the proof of Lemma\u00a0<ref> can be constructed by Algorithm\u00a0<ref> by simply choosing (\u00fb, v\u0302, \u0174, \u0176, \u1e90) = (0,0,0,0,0). In particular, similar to Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, it is worth noting that any instance constructed by Algorithm\u00a0<ref> necessarily satisfies Q_kk > 0 for each k \u2208\ud835\udd39. On the other hand, recall that the SDP-RLT relaxation is always exact for n \u2264 2. Therefore, similar to our discussion about Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, we conclude that the set of instances that can be constructed by Algorithm\u00a0<ref> may not necessarily encompass all instances in _R \\_RS. \n\n\n\n\u00a7 EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSION\n \n\nIn this section, we present numerical examples generated by each of the four algorithms given by Algorithms\u00a0<ref>\u2013<ref>. \n\nWe then close the section with a brief discussion.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Examples\n\n\nIn this section, we present instances of (BoxQP) generated by each of the four algorithms given by Algorithms\u00a0<ref>\u2013<ref>.

By Steps 7 and 8, we obtain \n\n    Q = [   \u03c3 - 2 \u03b8 \u03b3 + \u03b7 - \u03bc; \u03b3 + \u03b7 - \u03bc   \u03b4 - 2 \u03c1 ],    c = [ \u03b2 + \u03b8 + \u03bc - \u03b3;  \u03c1 - \u03b1 - \u03b3 -\u03b4 ].\n\nFor instance, if we choose \u03b8 = \u03c1 = \u03b3 = \u03b7 = \u03bc = 0, \u03c3 + \u03b4 > 0, \u03b1\u2265 0, and \u03b2\u2265 0, then Q \u227d 0, which implies that q(x) is a convex function. If we choose \u03c3 = \u03b4 = \u03b3 = \u03b7 = \u03bc = 0, \u03b8 + \u03c1 > 0, \u03b1\u2265 0, and \u03b2\u2265 0, then -Q \u227d 0, which implies that q(x) is a concave function. Finally, if we choose \u03b8 = \u03b4 = \u03b3 = \u03b7 = \u03bc = 0, \u03c3 > 0, \u03c1 > 0, \u03b1\u2265 0, and \u03b2\u2265 0, then Q is indefinite, which implies that q(x) is an indefinite quadratic function. For each of the three choices, the RLT relaxation is exact and x\u0302 = [ 0 1 ]^T is an optimal solution of the resulting instance of (BoxQP). Note that by setting \u0124 = 0 and \u0125 = 0 in Algorithm\u00a0<ref>, the same observations carry over.\n\n\n \nLet n = 3, \ud835\udd43 = {1}, \ud835\udd39 = {2}, and \ud835\udd4c = {3} in Algorithm\u00a0<ref>. Then, by Steps 3\u20138, we have k = 2 and \n\n    \u00fb = [ 0; 0; \u03b1 ],   v\u0302 = [ \u03b2; 0; 0 ],   \u0174 = [ 0 0 \u03b3; 0 \u03b4 \u03b8; \u03b3 \u03b8 \u03bc ],   \u0176 = [ \u03c1 0 0; \u03c3 0 0; \u03b7 \u03f5 \u03b6 ],   \u1e90 = [ \u03ba \u03bb \u03bd; \u03bb \u03c4 0; \u03bd 0 0 ],\n\nwhere each of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b8, \u03bc, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b7, \u03f5, \u03b6, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bd is a nonnegative real number, \u03b4 > 0 and \u03c4 > 0. By Steps 9 and 10, we obtain\n\n    Q = [   \u03ba - 2 \u03c1     \u03bb - \u03c3 \u03b3 + \u03bd - \u03b7;     \u03bb - \u03c3     \u03b4 + \u03c4     \u03b8 - \u03f5; \u03b3 + \u03bd - \u03b7     \u03b8 - \u03f5   \u03bc - 2 \u03b6 ],    c = [ \u03b2 + \u03c1 + \u03c3 + \u03b7 - \u03b3;         \u03f5 - \u03b4 - \u03b8; \u03b6 - \u03b3 - \u03b8 - \u03bc - \u03b1 ].\n\nIf we set each of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b8, \u03bc, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b7, \u03f5, \u03b6, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bd to zero, and choose any \u03b4 > 0 and \u03c4 > 0, then Q \u227d 0, which implies that q(x) is a convex function. On the other hand, if we set each of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b8, \u03bc, \u03c3, \u03b7, \u03f5, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bd to zero, and choose any \u03b4 > 0, \u03c4 > 0 and \u03c1 + \u03b6 > 0, then Q is indefinite, which implies that q(x) is an indefinite quadratic function. For each of the two choices, the RLT relaxation is inexact. Recall that an instance generated by Algorithm\u00a0<ref> cannot have a concave objective function since Q_kk = \u0174_kk + \u1e90_kk > 0.  \n\n\n \nLet n = 3, \ud835\udd43 = {1}, \ud835\udd39 = {2}, and \ud835\udd4c = {3} in Algorithm\u00a0<ref>. Then, by Steps 2\u20136, we have \n\n    \u00fb = [ 0; 0; \u03b1 ],   v\u0302 = [ \u03b2; 0; 0 ],   \u0174 = [ 0 0 \u03b3; 0 0 \u03b8; \u03b3 \u03b8 \u03bc ],   \u0176 = [ \u03c1 0 0; \u03c3 0 0; \u03b7 \u03f5 \u03b6 ],   \u1e90 = [ \u03ba \u03bb \u03bd; \u03bb 0 0; \u03bd 0 0 ],\n\nwhere each of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b8, \u03bc, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b7, \u03f5, \u03b6, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bd is a nonnegative real number. By Step 7, \u0124\u227b 0 is arbitrarily chosen. By Step 8, we have \u0125 = - \u0124x\u0302 and \u03b2\u0302= - \u0125^T x\u0302. By Steps 9 and 10, we therefore obtain\n\n    Q = [   \u03ba - 2 \u03c1     \u03bb - \u03c3 \u03b3 + \u03bd - \u03b7;     \u03bb - \u03c3         0     \u03b8 - \u03f5; \u03b3 + \u03bd - \u03b7     \u03b8 - \u03f5   \u03bc - 2 \u03b6 ] + \u0124,    c = [ \u03b2 + \u03c1 + \u03c3 + \u03b7 - \u03b3;             \u03f5 - \u03b8; \u03b6 - \u03b3 - \u03b8 - \u03bc - \u03b1 ] + \u0125.\n\nIf we set each of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b8, \u03bc, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b7, \u03f5, \u03b6, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bd to zero, then Q = \u0124\u227b 0, which implies that q(x) is a strictly convex function. On the other hand, if we set each of the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b8, \u03bc, \u03c3, \u03b7, \u03f5, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bd to zero, and choose a sufficiently large \u03c1 + \u03b6 > 0, then Q is indefinite, which implies that q(x) is an indefinite quadratic function. For each of the two choices, x\u0302 is the unique optimal solution of the resulting instance of (BoxQP) and the SDP-RLT relaxation is exact whereas the RLT relaxation is inexact. Recall that an instance generated by Algorithm\u00a0<ref> cannot have a concave objective function since Q_kk = \u0124_kk > 0. Indeed, such an instance of (BoxQP) necessarily has an optimal solution at a vertex whereas Algorithm\u00a0<ref> ensures that the resulting instance of (BoxQP) has a unique solution x\u0302\u2208 F \\ V. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Discussion\n\n\nWe close this section with a discussion of the four algorithms given by Algorithms\u00a0<ref>\u2013<ref>. Note that all instances of (BoxQP) can be divided into the following four sets:\n\n    _1     =    {(Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: \u2113^*_R = \u2113^*_RS = \u2113^*}, \n    _2     =    {(Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: \u2113^*_R <  \u2113^*_RS = \u2113^*}, \n    _3     =    {(Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: \u2113^*_R =  \u2113^*_RS < \u2113^*}, \n    _4     =    {(Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n: \u2113^*_R <  \u2113^*_RS < \u2113^*}.\n\n\nWe clearly have _1 = _R, and any such instance can be constructed by Algorithm\u00a0<ref>. On the other hand, Algorithm\u00a0<ref> returns an instance in _2 \u222a_3 \u222a_4. Any instance in _1 \u222a_2 can be constructed by Algorithm\u00a0<ref>. Finally, Algorithm\u00a0<ref> outputs an instance in the set _2 = _RS\\_R. \n\nNote that one can generate a specific instance of (BoxQP) with an inexact SDP-RLT relaxation by extending the example in  Section\u00a0<ref>\u00a0<cit.>. Let n = 2k + 1 \u2265 3 and consider the instance (Q,c) \u2208^n \u00d7^n given by Q = 1/n ee^T - I, where I \u2208^n denotes the identity matrix, and c = 0. Since Q is negative semidefinite, the optimal solution of (BoxQP) is attained at one of the vertices. It is easy to verify that any vertex v \u2208 F with k (or k + 1) components equal to 1 and the remaining ones equal to zero is an optimal solution, which implies that \u2113^* = 1/2(k^2/n - k). Let x\u0302 = 1/2 e and \n\n    X\u0302 = x\u0302x\u0302^T + M\u0302 = 1/4 ee^T + 1/4(n-1)(n I - ee^T ) = 1/4(1 + 1/n-1) I + 1/4(1 - 1/n-1) ee^T.\n\n\nIt is easy to verify that (x\u0302, X\u0302) \u2208_RS. Therefore, \n\n    \u2113^*_RS\u22641/2\u27e8 Q, X\u0302\u27e9 + c^T x\u0302 = -n/8.\n\nUsing n = 2k + 1, we conclude that \u2113^*_RS < \u2113^*, i.e., the SDP-RLT relaxation is inexact. Finally, this example can be extended to an even dimension n = 2k \u2265 4 by simply constructing the same example corresponding to n = 2k - 1 and then adding a component of zero to each of x\u0302 and c, and adding a column and row of zeros to each of Q and X\u0302. \n\nAn interesting question is whether an algorithm can be developed for generating more general instances with inexact SDP-RLT relaxations, i.e., the set of instances given by _3 \u222a_4. One possible approach is to use a similar idea as in Algorithms\u00a0<ref> and\u00a0<ref>, i.e., designate an optimal solution (x\u0302,X\u0302) \u2208_RS, which is not in the form of (v,vv^T) for any vertex v \u2208 F, and identify the conditions on the other parameters so as to guarantee that (x\u0302,X\u0302) is the unique optimal solution of the SDP-RLT relaxation (RS). Note that Lemma\u00a0<ref> can be used to easily construct an instance of (BoxQP) such that any feasible solution (x\u0302,X\u0302) \u2208_RS is an optimal solution of (RS). In particular, the condition (<ref>) can be satisfied by simply choosing an arbitrary matrix B \u2208^k such that B \u227d 0, and by defining \n\n    [  \u03b2\u0302 \u0125^T;   \u0125   \u0124 ] = P B P^T,\n\nwhere P \u2208^(n+1) \u00d7 k is a matrix whose columns form a basis for the nullspace of the matrix \n\n    [    1 x\u0302^T;   x\u0302   X\u0302 ].\n\nFor instance, the columns of P can be chosen to be the set of eigenvectors corresponding to zero eigenvalues. However, this procedure does not necessarily guarantee that (x\u0302,X\u0302) \u2208_RS is the unique optimal solution of (RS). Therefore, a characterization of the extreme points and the facial structure of _RS may shed light on the algorithmic construction of such instances. We intend to investigate this direction in the near future. \n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUDING REMARKS\n \n\nIn this paper, we considered RLT and SDP-RLT relaxations of quadratic programs with box constraints. We presented algebraic descriptions of instances of (BoxQP) that admit exact RLT relaxations as well as those that admit exact SDP-RLT relaxations. Using these descriptions, we proposed four algorithms for efficiently constructing an instance of (BoxQP) with predetermined exactness or inexactness guarantees. In particular, we remark that Algorithms\u00a0<ref>, <ref>, and <ref> can be used to construct an instance of (BoxQP) with a known optimal solution, which may be of independent interest for computational purposes.\n\nIn the near future, we intend to investigate the facial structure of the feasible region of the SDP-RLT relaxation and exploit it to develop algorithms for generating instances of (BoxQP) with an inexact SDP-RLT relaxation. \n\nAnother interesting direction is the computational complexity of determining whether, for a given instance of (BoxQP), the RLT or the SDP-RLT relaxation is exact. Our algebraic descriptions do not yield an efficient procedure for this problem. An efficient recognition algorithm may have significant implications for extending the reach of global solvers for (BoxQP).\n\n\n\n\nabbrv\n\n\n"}
