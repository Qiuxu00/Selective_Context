Geometry:\ngiven a set of points, a triangulation \nis globally Delaunay if and only if it is \nlocally Delaunay.\n\nA triangulation edge is called locally Delaunay if it is incident to\nonly one triangle, or it is incident to two triangles, and\nappears in the Delaunay triangulation of the four related\nvertices.\n\nThe Voronoi diagram  and the Delaunay triangulation of a point set\nare dual to each other.\nThese two \nhighly influential and  versatile structures are often \nused and computed interchangeably; see the book of\nAurenhammer<cit.> for  \nextensive information. \n\n\nLet us pose the following question:\nhow does Delaunay's\ntheorem extend to Voronoi diagrams of generalized (not necessarily\npoint) sites?\nWe are interested in simple geometric objects such as line\nsegments,  polygons, disks, or point clusters, as they often appear\nin application areas, and answering \nthis question is intimately related to\n\nefficient construction algorithms for Voronoi diagrams (or\ntheir duals) \non these objects.\n\nHere we consider this question in the framework of abstract Voronoi\ndiagrams\u00a0<cit.> so that we can simultaneously answer it for various\nconcrete and fundamental cases under their umbrella. \n\n\nAlthough Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations of\npoint sites have been \nwidely\nused in many fields of science, being available in most\nsoftware libraries of commonly used programming\nlanguages,  practice has  not been the same for their counterparts\nof simple \ngeometric\nobjects. \nIn fact it is surprising that certain related questions may have remained open or\nnon-optimally solved. \n\nEdelsbrunner and Seidel\u00a0<cit.> defined\nVoronoi diagrams as lower envelopes of distance functions in a space one dimension\nhigher, making a powerful link \nto arrangements, which made their rich combinatorial and algorithmic results\napplicable, e.g., \u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are different levels of difficulty concerning\narrangements of planes versus more general surfaces,\nwhich play a role, especially in practice.\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper we define Voronoi-like graphs based on \nlocal information, inspired by Delaunay's theorem.\nFollowing the framework of abstract Voronoi diagrams (AVDs)\u00a0<cit.>,\nlet S be a set of n  abstract sites (a set of indices)\n        and  be their  underlying system of bisectors, which satisfies\n        some simple combinatorial properties (see Sections\u00a0<ref>,\u00a0<ref>).\n\nConsider a graph G on the arrangement of the bisector system \npossibly truncated within a simply connected domain D.\nThe vertices of G are vertices of the bisector arrangement,\nits leaves lie on\nthe boundary \u2202 D,\nand the edges are  maximal bisector arcs \nconnecting pairs of vertices.\n\nA vertex v in G \nis called locally Voronoi, if v and its incident edges within\na small neighborhood around v appear in the Voronoi diagram\nof the three sites defining v (Def.\u00a0<ref>), see Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\nThe graph G is called Voronoi-like, if its vertices (other than its leaves on \u2202\nD) are locally Voronoi vertices (Def.\u00a0<ref>), see Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\nIf the graph G is a simple cycle on the arrangement of bisectors\nrelated to one site p and its vertices are locally\nVoronoi  of degree\u00a02, then it is \ncalled a Voronoi-like cycle, for brevity a site-cycle\n(Def.\u00a0<ref>). \n\nA major difference between  points in the\nEuclidean plane, versus non-points, such as line segments, disks, or\nAVDs, can be immediately pointed out: \nin the  former case the bisector system is a line arrangement, while\nin the latter, the bisecting curves are not even pseudolines.\nOn a line arrangement, it is not hard to see that a Voronoi-like\ngraph coincides with the Voronoi diagram of the involved sites:\nany Voronoi-like cycle is a convex polygon, which is in fact a\nVoronoi region in the Voronoi diagram of a subset of sites.\nBut in the arrangement of an abstract bisector system,  many different\nVoronoi-like  cycles can exist for the\nsame set of sites (see, e.g., Figure\u00a0<ref>).\nWhether a Voronoi-like graph  corresponds to a Voronoi\ndiagram is not immediately clear.\n\nIn this paper we show that a Voronoi-like graph on the arrangement of an abstract\nbisector system is as close as possible to being an abstract Voronoi\ndiagram, subject to, perhaps,   \nmissing some faces (see Def.\u00a0<ref>);\nif the graph misses no face, then it is a Voronoi\ndiagram. \n\n\n\n\n\n Thus, in the classic AVD model\u00a0<cit.>, where abstract Voronoi regions are\n connected and cover the plane, any Voronoi-like graph \n \n is indeed an abstract Voronoi diagram.\nThis result can be seen as an abstract dual version of Delaunay\u2019s\ntheorem. \n\nVoronoi-like graphs (and their duals) can be very useful structures to\nhold partial Voronoi information, either when dealing\nwith disconnected Voronoi regions, or when considering \npartial information concerning some region.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a Voronoi-like graph of partial information may be\nfar easier and faster than constructing the full diagram.\n\n\nIn some cases the full diagram may even be undesirable, \nas in the example of Section\u00a0<ref>\nin updating a constrained Delaunay triangulation.\n\n\n\nThe term Voronoi-like diagram was first used, in a restricted\nsence, by \nJunginger and Papadopoulou\u00a0<cit.>, defining it as a tree (occasionally a forest)\nthat subdivided a planar region enclosed by a so-called\nboundary curve \ndefined on a subset of Voronoi edges.\nTheir Voronoi-like diagram was then used as an intermediate\nstructure\nto perform deletion in an abstract Voronoi diagram in linear expected\ntime.\nIn this paper the formulation of a Voronoi-like graph\nis entirely different;\nwe nevertheless prove  that the Voronoi-like diagram\nof\u00a0<cit.> remains \n\na special case of the one \n\nin this paper.\nWe thus use the results of\u00a0<cit.> \nwhen applicable, and extend them to Voronoi-like cycles in an\nadmissible bisector system.\n\nIn the remainder of this section we consider an admissible bisector\nsystem  following the classic AVD model\u00a0<cit.>, where bisectors\nare unbounded simple curves and Voronoi regions are connected.\nTo avoid issues with infinity, we asume a large Jordan curve \u0393\n(e.g, a circle)\n\nbounding the computation domain, which is large\nenough to enclose any bisector intersection.\nIn the sequel, we list further results, which are obtained \nin this paper under this model.\n\n\n\nWe consider a Voronoi-like cycle C on the arrangement of bisectors\n_p\u2286\u222a\u0393, which are related to a site p\u2208 S.\nLet S_C\u2286 S\u2216{p} be the set of sites that\n(together with p) contribute to the bisector arcs in C.\nThe cycle C encodes a sequence of site\n  occurrences from  S_C.\nWe define the Voronoi-like graph (C), \nwhich can be thought as a Voronoi diagram of site\n  occurrences, instead of sites, whose order is represented  by C.\n\nWe prove that (C) is a tree, or a forest if C is unbounded,\nand  it \nexists for any Voronoi-like cycle C.\n\nThe uniqueness of (C) can be inferred from the results in\n<cit.>.\n\nThe same properties can be extended\nto Voronoi-like graphs of cycles\nrelated to a set P of k sites.\n\n\n\n\nWe then  consider the randomized incremental construction of\n<cit.>,\nand apply it to a Voronoi-like cycle in linear expected\ntime.\nIf C is the boundary of a Voronoi region then\n(C), which is\nthe part of the abstract Voronoi diagram (S_C), truncated by C,\n\ncan be computed in expected linear time (this has been previously shown\u00a0<cit.>).\n\nOtherwise, within the same time, the Voronoi-like graph of a (possibly\ndifferent) Voronoi-like cycle C\u2019,  enclosed by C, is computed by\nessentially the same algorithm. \nWe give conditions under which we can force the randomized algorithm\nto compute (C), if desirable, without hurting its\nexpected-linear time complexity,\nusing deletion\u00a0<cit.> as a subroutine.\nThe overall technique follows the randomized linear-time\nparadigm of Chew\u00a0<cit.>, originally given to compute the Voronoi\ndiagram of points in convex position.\n\nThe generalization of Chew's technique can potentially be used to convert\nalgorithms working on point sites, which use it,  to counterparts\ninvolving non-point sites that fall under the umbrella\nof abstract Voronoi diagrams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFinally, we give a direct application\n\nfor computing the Voronoi-like\ngraph of a site-cycle in linear expected\ntime, when updating a constrained Delaunay\ntriangulation upon insertion of a new line segment, simplifying upon the corresponding result of Shewchuk and\nBrown<cit.>.\nThe resulting algorithm is extremely simple. By modeling the problem\nas computing the dual of a Voronoi-like graph, given a Voronoi-like\ncycle (which is not a Voronoi region's boundary), the algorithmic description becomes almost trivial and explains\nthe technicalities, such as self-intersecting subpolygons, that are\nlisted by Shewchuk and Brown.\n\nThe overall technique computes abstract Voronoi, or \nVoronoi-like, trees and forests in linear expected time, given the\norder of their leaves along a Voronoi-like cycle. \n\nIn an extended paper, we also give simple conditions under which the\ncycle C\nis an arbitrary Jordan curve of constant complexity, along\nwhich the ordering of Voronoi regions is known.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PRELIMINARIES AND DEFINITIONS\n\n\nWe follow the framework of abstract Voronoi diagrams (AVDs), which have been defined by Klein\u00a0<cit.>.\nLet  S be a set of n  abstract sites (a set of indices)\n        and  be an underlying system of bisectors that satisfy\n        some simple combinatorial properties (some axioms).  \n        The bisector J(p,q)  of two sites p,q \u2208 S is a simple curve\n        \n        that\n        subdivides the plane into two open domains:\n        the dominance region of p, D(p,q),\n\thaving label p,\n\tand the dominance region of q, D(q,p),\n\thaving label q. \n\n        \n\n\n        The Voronoi region of site p is \n        \n\t\n    (p,S) = \u22c2_q \u2208 S \u2216{p}  D(p,q).\n\n\tThe Voronoi diagram of S is\n\t(S) = \u211d^2\u2216\u22c3_p \u2208 S(p, S).\n        The vertices and the edges of (S) are called Voronoi vertices\n        and \n        Voronoi edges, respectively.\n\n        Variants of abstract Voronoi diagrams\n        \n        of different degrees of generalization\n        have been\n        proposed, see e.g., <cit.>. \n        \n \n        Following the original formulation by Klein\u00a0<cit.>, the bisector system    is called  admissible, if it satisfies the following axioms,\n\tfor every subset S' \u2286S:\n        \n\t\n  \n    \n\t\n\t\t\n  (A1) Each Voronoi region (p, S') is\n                  non-empty and pathwise connected. \n\t\t\n  (A2) Each point in the plane belongs to the\n                  closure of a Voronoi region (p, S').\n                  \n  (A3) Each bisector is an unbounded simple\n                    curve homeomorphic to a line.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n  (A4) Any two bisectors intersect\n                  transversally and in a finite number of points.\n                  \n\n                \n\n              \nUnder these axioms, the abstract Voronoi diagram (S) is a planar graph\nof complexity O(n), which can be computed in \nO(nlog n)  time, randomized\n<cit.> or  deterministic\u00a0<cit.>.\n\n\n       To avoid dealing with infinity,  we\n       assume that (S) is truncated within a domain D_\u0393\n       enclosed by a large Jordan curve\n       \u0393 (e.g., a circle or a rectangle)\n       \n       such that all bisector intersections are contained in D_\u0393.\n       \n\n\tEach bisector crosses \u0393 exactly  twice and\n        transversally.\n        All Voronoi regions are assumed \n        to be  truncated by \u0393, and thus, lie  within the domain\n        D_\u0393.\n        \n        \n\n        We make a general position assumption that no three \n        bisectors involving one common site intersect at the same point,\n        that is, all vertices in the arrangement of the \n        bisector system  have degree 6, and Voronoi vertices\n        have degree 3.\n        \n\n          \n\n        Bisectors that have a site p in common are called\n        related, in particular, p-related.\n        Let _p\u2286 denote the set of all p-related\n        bisectors in .\n        Under axiom A2, if related bisectors J(p,q) and J(p,s) intersect \n        at a vertex v, then J(q,s) must also intersect with them\n        at the same vertex,\n        which is  a Voronoi vertex in V({p,q,s})\n        \n        (otherwise, axiom A2 would be violated in V({p,q,s})). \n        \n        \n        In an admissible bisector system, related bisectors can\n        intersect at most twice\u00a0<cit.>;\n        thus, \n        a Voronoi diagram of three sites may have at most  two Voronoi\n        vertices, see e.g., the bisectors of three line segments in\n        Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n        \n        The curve \u0393 can be interpreted as a p-related bisector\n        J(p,s_\u221e), for a site s_\u221e representing\n        infinity, for any p\u2208 S.\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an admissible bisector system, related bisectors that do not \nintersect or intersect twice must follow the patterns illustrated in Figures\u00a0<ref>\nand\u00a0<ref> respectively.\n\n\n\nIn Figure\u00a0<ref>(c) the pattern is illegal\nbecause of axiom A1, and in Figure\u00a0<ref>(d) because\n\nof combining axioms A2 and A1:\n\nJ(s,t) must pass through the intersection\npoints of J(p,s) and J(t,p), by A2. \nThen any possible configuration of J(s,t) \n\nresults in violating either axiom A1 or A2. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern in Figure\u00a0<ref>(b) can\nbe shown illegal by combining axioms A1 and A2 in the\npresence of  J(s,t), which does not intersect J(s,p) nor J(t,p). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n      \n      \n [<cit.>]\n\nIn an admissible bisector system, no cycle in the arrangment of\nbisectors related to p\ncan have the label p on the exterior of the cycle, for all of its\narcs.\n\n\n\n      \n        \n        Any component \u03b1 of a bisector curve J(p,q) is called an\n        arc. We use s_\u03b1\u2208 S to denote the site such  that\n         arc \u03b1\u2286 J(p,s_\u03b1).\n        Any component of \u0393 is called a \u0393-arc.\n        \n        \n        The arrangement of a bisector set _x\u2286 is denoted by\n        (_x).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DEFINING ABSTRACT VORONOI-LIKE GRAPHS AND CYCLES\n\n\n\nIn order to define Voronoi-like graphs in a\nbroader sense, we can relax  axioms A1-A4 in this section.\nIn particular, we  drop axiom A1 to allow disconnected\nVoronoi regions and relax axiom A3 to allow disconnected (or even closed)\nbisecting curves. \n\nThe bisector J(p,q)  of two sites p,q \u2208 S\n        \n        \n        still subdivides the plane into two  open domains:\n        the dominance region of p, D(p,q),\n\t\n\tand the dominance region of q, D(q,p),\n        however, D(p,q) \n        may be disconnected or  bounded.\n        Axioms A2 and A4 remain.\n        \n        \n        Unless otherwise specified, we use the general term abstract bisector\n          system to denote such a relaxed variant in\n        the subsequent definitions and in\n        Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\n        \n        \n        The term admissible bisector system always implies\n        \n        axioms  A1-A4.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nLet G=(V,E) be a graph on the arrangement of an abstract bisector system ,\ntruncated within a simply connected domain D\u2286 D_\u0393 (the\nleaves of G are on  \u2202 D).\nThe vertices of G are  arrangement vertices \nand the edges are maximal bisector arcs connecting pairs of vertices.\n\nFigure\u00a0<ref> illustrates examples of such graphs on a\nbisector arrangment (shown in grey).\nUnder  the general position assumption, the vertices of G, except\nthe leaves on \u2202 D,  are of degree 3.\n\n\n\n\n            \n\nA vertex v in graph G \nis called locally Voronoi, if v and its incident graph edges, within\na small neighborhood around v, N(v), appear in the Voronoi diagram\nof the set of three sites defining v, denoted S_v, \n\n\n\nsee Figure\u00a0<ref>(a).\n\nIf instead we consider the farthest\nVoronoi diagram of \nS_v, then v is called locally\nVoronoi of the farthest-type, see Figure\u00a0<ref>(b).\nAn ordinary locally Voronoi vertex  is \n\nof the nearest-type.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n        \t\n\n\n\nA graph G on the arrangement of an abstract bisector system,\nenclosed within a simply connected domain D, is called Voronoi-like, if its vertices (other than its leaves on \u2202\nD) are locally Voronoi vertices.\nIf G is disconnected, we further require that consecutive leaves\non \u2202 D have consistent labels, i.e., they are incident \nto the dominance region of the same site, as implied  by the incident\nbisector edges in G, see Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph  G is actually called an abstract Voronoi-like graph but, \n\nfor brevity, we typically skip the term abstract.\n\nWe next consider the relation between a Voronoi-like graph G and the Voronoi diagram\n(S)\u2229 D, where S is the set of sites involved in the edges of  G. \n\n\n\n\nSince the vertices of G are locally Voronoi, each face f in G\nmust have the label of exactly one site s_f in its interior, which\nis called the site of f.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nImagine we superimpose G and  (S)\u2229 D. \nA face f of (S)\u2229 D is said to be missing from G, if\n f is covered by faces of G that belong to sites that\n are different\n from the site of f, see Figure\u00a0<ref>, which\n is derived from Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \nLet r be a face\nof an abstract Voronoi-like graph G and let  s_r  denote its site (the bisectors\nbounding r have the label s_r inside r). Then one of the\nfollowing holds:\n\n\n  * there is a Voronoi face r' in (S)\u2229 D, of the same site\n  s_r, r'\u2286(s_r,S), such that r'\u2286 r, see\n  Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n  * face r is disjoint from the Voronoi region (s_r,S). \nFurther, it is\nentirely covered by Voronoi faces of (S)\u2229 D, which are\nmissing from G, see\n  Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\nImagine we superimpose G and  (S)\u2229 D.\n\n\nFace r in G cannot partially overlap any face of the Voronoi\nregion (s_r,S)\nbecause if it did, some s_r-related bisector, \nwhich contributes to the boundary of r, would\nintersect the interior of  (s_r,S), which is not possible by the\ndefinition of a Voronoi region. For the same reason, r cannot be\ncontained in (s_r,S).

We use\nthe following lemma, which can be extracted from\u00a0<cit.>\n(using Theorem\u00a018, Theorem\u00a020, and Lemma\u00a021 of <cit.>). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven (C), arc \u03b1\u2208 J(p,s) \u2229 D_C, and the endpoints of \u03b1 on C, we can\ncompute the merge curve \nJ(\u03b1)=\u2202 R(\u03b1, C_\u03b1), using standard\ntechniques \nas in ordinary Voronoi diagrams.\nIf the endpoints of \u03b1 lie on different arcs of C, or \u0393,\n\nthe time complexity is  O(|J(\u03b1)| +|C\u2216 C_\u03b1|).\n\nOtherwise,  \u03b1 splits a bisector arc \u03c9, and\nits region  R(\u03c9,C), into\nR(\u03c9_1,C_\u03b1) and R(\u03c9_2,C_\u03b1);\nthe time complexity increases to  O(|J(\u03b1)|+\nmin{|R(\u03c9_1,C_\u03b1)|, |R(\u03c9_2,C_\u03b1)|}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correctness proofs from <cit.>, which are related\nto Lemma\u00a0<ref>,  \nremain intact if performed on a Voronoi-like cycle, as long as the arc \u03b1 is\ncontained in the cycle's domain; see also \n<cit.>.\n\nThus, Lemma\u00a0<ref> can be established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we prove the existence of (C) by construction.\nTo this goal we use a split relation between bisectors in\n_p or sites in S_C, which had also been considered in\n<cit.>, see Figure\u00a0<ref>. \n\n\n\nFor any two sites s,t\u2208 S_C, \nwe say that J(p,s) splits\nJ(p,t)  (we also say that s splits t, with respect\nto p),\nif J(p,t) \u2229 D(p,s) \ncontains two connected components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFrom the fact that related bisectors in an admissible bisector system\nintersect at most twice, as shown in\nFigs.\u00a0<ref> and <ref>,\nwe can infer\nthat the split relation  is asymmetric and transitive, \n\nthus, it is also acyclic.\n\nThe split relation  induces a strict partial order on S_C,\n\nwhere s<_p t, if J(p,s) splits J(p,t), see Figure\u00a0<ref>.\nLet o_p be a topological order of the resulting directed acyclic \ngraph, which underlies  the split relation on S_c induced by p.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following lemma shows that (C) exists\n\nby construction. \nIt builds upon a more restricted version regarding a boundary\ncurve that had been considered in\u00a0<cit.>. \n \n\n\n\nGiven the topological ordering of the split relation o_p, \n(C)\ncan be constructed in O(|C|^2) time; thus, (C) exists.\n\nFurther, at the same time,\nwe can construct (C')  for any other\nVoronoi-like cycle C' \nthat is enclosed by C, S_C'\u2286 S_C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the order o_p, we follow the randomized approach of\nChew\u00a0<cit.>, and apply the arc-insertion operation of\nLemma\u00a0<ref>, which is extracted from\u00a0<cit.>.\n\nLet the sites in S_C be numbered according to \no_p=(s_1,s_2\u2026 s_m), m=|S_C|.\nWe first show that C can be constructed incrementally, by arc-insertion,\nfollowing o_p.\n\nLet C_i denote the p-cycle constructed by the first\ni sites in o_p. \n\nC_1 consists of J(s_1,p) and a \u0393-arc, \n\nthat is, C_1=\u2202(D(p,s_i)\u2229\nD_\u0393). Clearly C_1 encloses C.\n\nSuppose  that C_i encloses C.\n\nThen, given C_i, let C_i+1 by the p-cycle obtained\nby inserting to C_i the components of J(s_i+1,p)\u2229 D_C_i, which\ncorrespond to arcs in C.\nFor each such component \u03b1 (\u03b1\u2208 J(s_i+1,p)\u2229\nD_C_i), if some portion of \u03b1 appears in C, then compute\nC_i\u2295\u03b1; if \u03b1 does not appear in C, ignore\nit.\nLet C_i+1 be the resulting\np-cycle after all such components of J(s_i+1,p) have been inserted to C_i, one by one.\n\nBecause  any site whose p-bisector splits \nJ(p,s_i+1) has already been processed, a distinct component\nof J(s_i+1,p)\u2229 D_C_i must exist for each arc of \ns_i+1 in C.\nThus, C_i+1 can be derived from C_i and must enclose C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have shown that C can be constructed incrementally, if we follow\no_p, in time  O(|C|^2).\n\nIt remains to construct the Voronoi-like graph\n(C_i) at each step i.\n\nTo this end, we use Lemma\u00a0<ref>, starting at \n(C_1)=\u2205.\nGiven (C_i) and C_i+1,  we can apply\nLemma\u00a0<ref> to each arc \u03b1\u2286 J(s_i+1,p) in C_i+1\u2216\nC_i.\nThe correctness proof of <cit.> ensures the feasibility and the correctness of each\narc insertion, thus, it also ensures the existence of (C_i+1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above incremental construction can also\ncompute (C') \nby computing both C_i and C_i'\nat each step i.\n\n\nSuppose C_i=C_i', where C_1'=C_1.\nWhen considering site s_i+1, we\ninsert to  C_i' all components of J(s_i+1,p)\u2229 D_C_i \ncorresponding to arcs of s_i+1, which appear in either  C or \nC'. \n\nThus,  C_i+1' is derived from  C_i+1 by inserting any additional\narcs \u03b1' of s_i+1, where  \u03b1'\u2208 C'\u2216 C.\nNote that all arcs of\ns_i+1 that appear in C are inserted to C_i+1', even if they do not\nappear in C'.\nThis is possible because of the\norder o_p: any site whose p-bisector splits \nJ(p,s_i+1) has already been processed, thus, a distinct component\nof J(s_i+1,p)\u2229 D_C_i must exist for each arc of\ns_i+1 in either C or C', which can be identified.\n\nReferring to (C_i+1), the insertion of an additional arc\n\u03b1' may only cause an existing region to shrink.\nTherefore, we derive two invariants: 1.

Thus,\n(\u0108)\u2229 f= (\u0108, \u0108\u2229 C')\u2229 f = (\u0108, \u0108\u2229 C)\u2229 f.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 UPDATING A CONSTRAINT DELAUNAY\n       TRIANGULATION\n\n      We give an example of a Voronoi-like cycle C, which does  not\n     correspond to a Voronoi\n     region, but we need to compute the adjacencies of the Voronoi-like\n     graph (C).\n     The problem appears in the incremental construction of a constraint Delaunay\n       triangulation (CDT), a well-known variant of the Delaunay\n     triangulation, in which a given set of segments is constrained\n     to appear in the triangulation of a point set Q, which includes\n     the endpoints of the segments, see <cit.> and references therein.\n     \n     Every edge of the CDT is either an input segment or is\n     locally Delaunay (see Section\u00a01).\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     The incremental construction to compute a CDT,\n     first constructs an ordinary\n       Delaunay triangulation of the points in Q, and then inserts segment\n      constraints, one by one, updating the triangulation after\n      each insertion.\n \n      Shewchuk and  Brown\u00a0<cit.> gave an expected\n      linear-time algorithm to perform each update. \n      Although the algorithm is summarized in a pseudocode, which could then\n      be directly implemented,\n      \n      \n      the algorithmic description is quite\n      technical having to make sense of self-intersecting polygons,\n      their triangulations, and other exceptions.\n      \n      \n      \n      We show that the problem corresponds exactly to computing (in\n      dual sense) the\n      Voronoi-like graph of a Voronoi-like cycle. \n      \n      \n      Thus, a very simple randomized incremental construction, with\n      occasional calls to Chew's algorithm\u00a0<cit.> to delete a\n      Voronoi region of points, can be derived.\n      Quoting from <cit.>: incremental segment insertion is\n      likely to remain the most used CDT construction algorithm, so it\n      is important to provide an understanding of its performance and\n      how to make it run fast.\n      We do exactly the latter in this section.\n      \n      \n      \n\n\n\n\n     \n        \n\n\n      \n       When a new constraint segment s is inserted in a CDT, the\n       triangles, which get \n       destroyed by that segment, are  identified and\n       deleted\u00a0<cit.>. This creates two cavities that need to be\n       re-triangulated using constrained Delaunay triangles,\n       see Figure\u00a0<ref>(a),(b), borrowed from <cit.>,\n       where one cavity is shown shaded (in light blue) and the other unshaded.\n       \n       \n       \n       The boundary of each cavity need not \n       \n       be  a simple polygon. \n       However, each cavity implies a Voronoi-like cycle,\n       whose Voronoi-like graph re-triangulates the cavity, see Figure\u00a0<ref>(c),(d).\n       \n      \n      \n        \n\n      \n      Let  P=(p_1,p_2,\u2026, p_n) denote one of the cavities, where p_1 \u2026 p_n\n      \n      is the sequence of cavity vertices in counterclockwise order, and  p_1,p_n are the endpoints of s.\n      Let S denote the corresponding set of points (|S|\u2264 n) and\n      let _s denote the underlying bisector system\n      involving the segment s and points in S.\n      Let  C be the s-cycle in (_S\u222a\u0393) that has one s-bisector\n      arc for each  vertex in P, in the same order as P, see\n      Figure\u00a0<ref>.\n      Note that one  point in S may contibute more than one arc in\n      C.\n\n \n      \n    \n        \n      The  s-cycle C exists and can be derived from P in linear time.\n    \n\n       \n      \n    \n      Let p_i\u2208 P, 1<i<n. The diagonal of the original CDT, which bounded the triangle  incident to\n       p_ip_i-1 (resp. p_ip_i+1) was a\n       locally Delaunay edge intersected by s.\n      Thus, there is a\n      circle through p_i that is tangent to s that contains \n      neither p_i-1 nor p_i+1, see Figure\u00a0<ref>. Hense, an arc of J(p_i,s) must\n      exist, which contains the center of this circle, and extends\n      from an intersection point of J(p_i,s)\u2229\n      J(p_i-1,s) to an intersection point of J(p_i,s)\u2229\n      J(p_i+1,s). The portion\n      of J(p_i,s) between these two intersections corresponds to the\n      arc of p_i on C, denoted \u03b1_i.\n      Note that the s-bisectors are parabolas that share the same directrix\n      (the line through s), thus, they may intersect twice.\n      It is also possible that  p_i-1=p_i+1. In each case,\n      we can determine which intersection  is relavant to arc\n      \u03b1_i, given the counterclockwise order of P.\n      Such questions can be reduced to in-circle tests involving the\n      segment s and three points.\n      \n      \n      \n      \n     \n\n\n     Let (P)  denote the  constraint Delaunay triangulation of\n     P. Its edges are either locally Delaunay or they are cavity edges on\n     the boundary of P.\n  \n     \n       The (P) is  dual to \n       (C), where C is the s-cycle derived from P.\n     \n\n      \n     \n      The claim derives from the definitions, Lemma\u00a0<ref>, which\n      shows the existence of C,\n      and the properties of \n      Theorem\u00a0<ref>. \n      The dual of (C) has one node for each s-bisector arc of C,\n      thus, one node per vertex in P.\n      An edge of (C) incident to two locally Voronoi\n      vertices v,u  involves four different sites in\n      S; thus, its dual edge is locally Delaunay.\n      The dual of an edge incident to a leaf of C, \n      \n      is an edge of the\n      boundary of P. \n     \n     \n \n        \nNext, we \ncompute (C) in expected linear time.\nBecause C is not the complete boundary of a Voronoi-region,\nif we apply the construction of Theorem\u00a0<ref>,  \nthe computed cycle C_n may be \n\nenclosed by C.\nThis is because of occasional split operations, given the random order\nof arc-insertion,\nwhich may create auxiliary arcs that have no correspondence to vertices of\nP.\n\nHowever, we can use Proposition\u00a0<ref> to delete such auxiliary\narcs and their faces. \n\n\n\n\nThe sites in S are points, thus, any Voronoi-like cycle\nin their bisector arrangement coincides with a Voronoi region. \nBy calling Chew's algorithm\u00a0<cit.> we can delete any face of any auxiliary\narc in expected time linear in the complexity of the face.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is easy to dualize the technique to directly compute constraint\nDelaunay triangles.\n\nIn fact, the cycle C can remain  conceptual with no need to explicitly compute it. \n\n\n\n \nThe dual  nodes  are  graph\ntheoretic, each one corresponding to an  s-bisector  arc,\n\nwhich in turn corresponds to a cavity vertex.\n\n\n\nThis explains the\npolygon self-crossings of <cit.> if we \ndraw these graph-theoretic  nodes on the cavity vertices\n\nduring the intermediate steps of the construction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm to compute (C) (or its dual (C)=(P)) is very simple.\nLet  o=(v_1,\u2026 v_n) be a random permutation of the vertices in\nP, except the endpoints of s; let v_1=p_1 and\nv_2=p_n.\nLet  P_i denote the sub-sequence of P consisting of the first\ni vertices in o.\nLet  C_i denote the corresponding s-cycle, which has one s-bisector arc for each vertex in P_i in the\norder of P_i (see Lemma\u00a0<ref>).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an initial  phase\u00a01, starting at P_n=P, delete\nvertices in reverse order o^-1, recording the\nneighbors of each vertex v_i in P_i at the time of its deletion.\n\n\n\nIn phase\u00a02, \nconsider the vertices in o in increasing order, starting with\n(C_3), and using the arc-insertion operation \n(Lemma\u00a0<ref>)\nto build C_i and \n(C_i)\n\nincrementally, 3\u2264 i\u2264 n.\n\n\nInstead of (C_i), we can equivalently be constructing the dual (C_i).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn more detail, let C_3 be the s-cycle obtained by the two perpendicular lines\nthrough the endpoints of s, which are truncated on one side by \u0393, and on\nthe other by  J(v_3,s).  C_3 consists of four arcs on: J(s,p_1), J(v_3,s),\nJ(s,p_n) and \u0393, respectively. (C_3) has one Voronoi vertex\nfor (p_1,v_3, p_n), see Figure\u00a0<ref>(a). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven (C_i-1), we insert v_i  between its two neighboring vertices\nw,u, which have been recorded in phase\u00a01. Suppose w,v_i,u appear\nin counterclockwise order in P, see Figure\u00a0<ref>(a), where v_i=v. \n\nLet \u03b1_i  denote the arc of v_i  in C_i, in particular, \u03b1_i is the component of J(v_i,s)\u2229 D_C_i-1\nwhose endpoints lie between the arcs of u and w in C_i-1,\ncall them \u03b2 and \u03c9 respectively, see\nFigure\u00a0<ref>(a), where \u03b1_i=\u03b1.\nAmong the three cases of the arc\ninsertion operation, we only consider  the split case (depicted in\nFigure\u00a0<ref>(c) and\u00a0<ref>(a)),\nwhere\nJ(v_i,s) splits (intersects twice) the arc \u03c9\u2286\nJ(w,s) in C_i-1; the other cases are straightforward.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, when inserting \u03b1_i to  (C_i-1), the region  R(\u03c9,C_i-1) is split in two faces, where \none, say R(\u03c9_2,C_i), does not correspond\nto w (since it is out of order with respect to  w,v_i, u).\nThat is,  we compute  (C_i'), where\nC_i'=C_i-1\u2295\u03b1_i and includes the auxiliary arc  \u03c9_2.\n\n\nTo obtain  (C_i) we can call Chew's algorithm to delete R(\u03c9_2,C_i'),\nthus, restore C_i to its original definition.\n\n\n\n\nThe increase to the time complexity of step i \nis expected O(|R(\u03c9_2,C_i)|.\nThis is \nnot covered by the argument of <cit.>, which proves\nthe expected constant time complexity of step i.\n\nHowever, \nby deleting auxiliary arcs,  (C_i) becomes\norder-independent, therefore, we can  prove the\ntime complexity of step i in simpler\nterms by invoking backwards analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time complexity of step i, which computes (C_i)\nenhanced by calling Chew's\nalgorithm to delete any generated auxiliary arc, is expected\nO(1). \n        \n\n\n\nSince C_i-1 contains no auxiliary arcs, step i can be performed\nin time proportional to |R(\u03b1_i,C_i')| +\n|R(\u03c9_2,C_i')|, where C_i'=C_i-1\u2295\u03b1_i, and\n\u03c9_2 is the auxiliary arc when \ninserting \u03b1_i to  (C_i-1). \nThe first term |R(\u03b1_i,C_i')|\u2264\n|R(\u03b1_i,C_i)|.\nThe second term can be expressed as \n|R(\u03c9_2,C_i\u2295\u03c9_2|), i.e, the face complexity of \u03c9_2, if we\ninsert the arc \u03c9_2 to (C_i). We charge 1 unit, on\nbehalf of  v_i, to any vertex of (C_i)\nthat would get deleted if we inserted the arc \u03c9_2.\n\nLet V_i={v_3\u2026 v_i}. \n\nAny vertex in V_i is\nequally likely to be the last one considered at step i.\nThus, we can add up the time complexity of step i when considering  \neach vertex in V_i as last, and take the average.\nThe total is  O(|(C_i)|)  for the first term, plus the total\nnumber of charges for the second.\nBy the following lemma the total number of charges is also\nO(|(C_i)|).\nTherefore, the average time complexity is O(1).\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\nAt step i,  any vertex  of  (C_i) can be charged\nat most twice. \n\n\n\nConsider a vertex t of (C_i) and its Delaunay circle C_t\npassing through three vertices of P_i, indicated by crosses in\nFigure\u00a0<ref>(b). The three vertices\npartition C_t in three arcs: A_1,A_2, A_3. The segment s must\ncross through (intersect twice) one of these arcs, say A_1, since\ns must be visible to t and the three defining sites of  C_t.\n\n\nSuppose t is charged \none unit by  v\u2208 V_i.\nSuppose w,v,u appear consecutively counterclockwise around P_i. \nLet \u03c9,\u03b2 be the arcs corresponding to  w and u,  respectively, in\nC_i-1, see Figure\u00a0<ref>(a).\nSince t is charged \none unit by  v, it follows that \u03c9\u2208 C_i-1 gets split by the insertion\nof v creating an auxiliary arc \u03c9_2, and  t lies in R(\u03c9_2,C_i\u2295\u03c9_2).\nThat is, w is enclosed by C_t but  v and u are not.\nThus, diagonal vu must intersect C_t, and since it cannot obstruct\nthe visibility between s and the defining points of C_t, it must\ncross through another arc of C_t, say A_2; diagonal uv leaves\nw and t on opposite sides.\n\n\nBut s must be visible to diagonal uv,\nthus,  no other diagonal\nof P_i can also cross through A_2,  obstructing the visibility of\nuv  and s.\nThus, v can receive at most one charge in relation to arc A_2.\nThis implies that v can receive at most one more charge in total, which  corresponds to\nA_3.\n\n\n\n\nFigure\u00a0<ref> illustrates the incremental construction\nfor an indicated order o=(v_1,\u2026, v_6). Vertices  v_4 and v_6 coincide.\nThe insertion of v_5 causes the arc of v_4 to\nsplit, see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c). The result of deleting the\ncreated auxiliary arc is shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(d);\nwe insert v_6 \nin Fig.\u00a0<ref>(e).\nIn this example, we could avoid deleting the\nauxiliary arc of v_4, which is created by inserting  v_5 in  Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c), because it overlaps with an\narc of C, therefore, it is known that it will later be\nre-inserted and it cannot obstruct the insertion process of other arcs.\n\n\n\n     \n\n      \n\n\u00a7 CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\n\n\nWe have also considered the variant of computing, in linear\nexpected time, a Voronoi-like \ntree (or forest) within a simply connected domain D, of constant \nboundary complexity, given the ordering of some Voronoi faces along the \nboundary of D. In an extended paper, we will provide conditions under which the same\nessentially technique can be applied. \n\n\nIn future research, we are also interested in \nconsidering\ndeterministic linear-time algorithms to compute\nabstract Voronoi-like trees and forests as inspired by <cit.>.\n\n\n\n       \n\n\n\n"}
