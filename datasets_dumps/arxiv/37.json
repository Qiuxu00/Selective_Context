Benavidez^1,4 \n    March 30, 2023\n==========================================================================================\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\nMany Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) have been discovered in the last two decades, including at sizes smaller than a few km and fast spin rates.  \n<cit.> showed that an excess of slow rotators (spin period T > 24 h), as well as fast rotators (2.2 h <T< 2.8 h), is present in the NEA population at size D > 0.2 km. The former is also found in main belt asteroids, while the excess of fast rotators is not, and it seems to be peculiar to NEAs. It is noteworthy that 2/3 of fast spinning NEAs are binaries <cit.> and they correspond to the concentration of fast spin rate of primaries of NEA binaries in front of the \u201cspin barrier\u201d at \u2248 2.2 h. \nThe spin state with which asteroids enter the NEA region is mostly affected by non-catastrophic collisions while in the asteroid belt <cit.>, and partially by the non-gravitational YORP effect. YORP is also the main driving source for NEAs spin up once in the inner planet region.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Asteroid stability limits and spin\u2013up\n\n\nWe recall here the spin limits for mass shedding defining an upper threshold on the rotation rate at which a particle at the equator of a spherical body is at neutral equilibrium between gravity and centrifugal force. For a homogeneous sphere, the relation for the critical spin rate is:\n\n\n    \u03c9_cr=\u221a(4 \u03c0 G \u03c1/3)\n\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the bulk density of the object. \nSpin limit depends on asteroid density: e.g., T = 2.2 h is the limit corresponding to a spherical body of  density \u03c1=2250 kg/m^3, which is typical of S-type gravitational aggregate asteroids; instead,   spin limit is  T=3.0 h for  C-type gravitational aggregate asteroids, with \u03c1=1200 kg/m^3. Such densities differ from the density of their meteorite analogues due to  macro\u2013porous structure of gravitational aggregates. \n\n\nAs soon as enough spin data were available <cit.>, such a spin limit became evident when plotting size vs spin period. Very rarely asteroids larger than 200\u2013300 m in diameter (D) have been observed with a rotational period smaller than 2.2 h. This has led to interpretations of the internal structure of such asteroids. Fast rotators are instead common at D<200 m.\nFocusing the discussion on the size range 300 m \u2014 10 km, the interpretation of the spin limit leads to two slightly different regimes <cit.>. For asteroids larger than 3 km, the spin barrier does not constrain whether these are strength\u2013less objects or just cracked but coherent bodies. In fact, the upper limit on the tensile strength \u2013given by the barrier itself\u2013 is higher than a scaled tensile strength of cracked but coherent bodies. Instead, for asteroids smaller than 3 km, the maximum possible tensile strength allowed by the spin barrier is too low for these asteroids to be cracked but coherent bodies, so they should have predominantly cohesion\u2013less structures. \n\nNon\u2013coherent asteroids are aggregates that have re-accumulated fragments by self\u2013gravity right after shattering  events. On the contrary, internally cracked objects may arise due to  shattering at the threshold energy for fragmentation, with little kinetic energy left to reshuffle fragments. Another way of producing cracked structures is by series of sub\u2013catastrophic collisions summing up similar damage in the overall structure as one single barely shattering event <cit.>. In that case, the object may be coherent allowing for some tensile stress.\n\nBoth coherent bodies and gravitational aggregates (GA) (often called rubble piles) may withstand spin rates higher than the critical ones for fluids found by Chandrasekhar <cit.>, and spin ideally up to the spin barrier around 2.2 h before failing apart. In the case of coherent \u2013monolithic\u2013 structure, that is due to internal solid state forces, which do withstand spin rates beyond that limit. This is especially the case of bodies smaller than 300 m.\nInstead, non-coherent asteroids (as  gravitational aggregates are) may be spun up and undergo shape change corresponding to a minimum energy configuration \u2013led by dissipative forces (e.g., internal friction)\u2013 compatible with increasing angular momentum. That is achieved by rotation about the maximum angular inertia axis. As a result, some of those bodies might become top\u2013shaped <cit.>. \n\nTherefore, shear strength may be present due to friction and interlocking between GA components <cit.>, as a reaction to the shear stress due to centrifugal force, increasing structural yield. The presence of inter\u2013particle cohesion has also been suggested <cit.>, though still a matter of debate. Such shear strength, regardless of its nature,  may prevent the whole structure from falling apart when the rotation spin rate exceeds the stability limit for fluid bodies. This mechanism is successful until the spin barrier is reached. \nAt that point, the body is no longer able to adjust the exceeding energy and angular momentum by shape change through energy dissipation by friction. Depending on internal stiffness, fission or mass shedding takes place, eventually leading to asteroid binary or pair/clan formation <cit.>. The mechanisms of formation of NEA binary systems are a matter of debate and are beyond the scope of this study.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 NEA binary systems with fast spinning primary\n\n\nMany binary systems in the NEA population share a number of common features: (a) small mass ratio (\u2248 0.01) for satellite to primary components; (b) fast spin primary; (c) top-shape primary  <cit.>.\nOf all binary systems with fast rotating primary, we identified a handful near the edge of stability, as reported in Table <ref> together with a number of single bodies. In this work, we focus on the Didymos system because of its interest as the target of  both DART (NASA) and Hera (ESA) space missions. However, the 1996 FG3 binary system also was the former goal of the MarcoPolo-R mission and is now the sample return target of the Chinese (CNSA)  Zheng He space mission.\nBeyond binary primaries, it is worth mentioning that some lonely top\u2013shape NEAs also show fast spin rates. This is indeed the case of 2008 EV5, which was the target of the un\u2013selected ESA (2014) MarcoPolo-R mission. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The Didymos system\n\n \nThe NEA binary (65803) Didymos is the S-type target of the DART (NASA) and Hera (ESA) space missions. Model predictions may be tested by combined data from those two missions, which makes this a particularly interesting system to study. This asteroid is classified as an Apollo NEA with a semimajor axis of \n1.6442688843 \u00b1 1.6 \u00d7 10^-9 au, and a large eccentricity of 0.383882802 \u00b1 3\u00d7 10^-9 (pre-DART impact heliocentric ephemeris solution 181).\nIts perihelion is therefore well inside the inner asteroid belt, where the asteroid spends 1/3 of its orbital period.\n\nThe pre-\u2013impact estimations of the system main physical characteristics were the values available when this research started, and numerical simulations were run. \n\nThe discussion on how post\u2013DART impact estimation may affect results is carried out in Sec. 5. \n\nDidymos, the primary of the binary, had estimated principal axes extent sizes of 832  (\u00b1 3%)\u00d7 837  (\u00b1 3%)\u00d7 786  (\u00b1 5%) km, the last of which is the size along its spin axis. A Didymos shape model has been derived using both radar and optical telescope data, clearly indicating a top\u2013shape <cit.> before the DART and LICIACube missions imaging. The mass of the system was estimated as 5.278 \u00d7 10^11\u00b1 10% kg <cit.> from the orbital period of the secondary, named Dimorphos, which is known, 11.9216289 \u00b1 2.8 \u00d7 10^-6 h (S. Naidu and S. Chesley, personal communication). \nThe spin period of Didymos is 2.2600\u00b1 0.0001 h <cit.> and its bulk density was estimated to be 2170 kg/m^3, with a 30% uncertainty. \nThe size of Dimorphos was estimated to be 164\u00b1 10 m, compatible with oblate to prolate shape with axes ratio between 0 and 1.3.\nNo information on the spin rate of Dimorphos is available, though it is assumed to be synchronous to its orbital period. Separation between components is 1.19\u00b1 0.03 km <cit.>. \n\n\nAvailable data do not allow predictions about the internal structure of any of the two bodies. \nNevertheless, updated estimates of some physical parameters critical to this study available during the publication process of this work <cit.> confirm L and LL ordinary chondrites as the best meteorite analogues for Didymos. Considering that typical grain density of such meteorite complexes is in the 3500-3600 kg/m^3 range, the system bulk density is compatible with at least 30% bulk porosity of its components. Therefore, the primary may  have a gravitational aggregate structure with unknown size distribution of components.\n\n \n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Asteroids on the edge of stability\n\n \n\nFor some NEAs, the centrifugal force acting on surface particles and boulders at near\u2013equatorial latitudes may slightly overcome the gravitational pull of the asteroid itself in the spinning, non\u2013inertial reference frame of the rotating asteroid. In that case, the radial component of  acceleration for surface particles is directed outwards, allowing them to leave the surface and undergo corresponding dynamical evolution. Leaving the surface does not mean that particles are lost from the asteroid. In fact, they start their motion at zero velocity but non-zero acceleration, and as soon as they lift off they move under the gravitational field of the asteroid, the non-inertial apparent forces due to rotation, the Sun's gravity and its radiation, and \u2013in the case of binary systems\u2013 the gravitational pull of the secondary. Other forces may act as well on small particles on the surface, like electrostatic or molecular forces (cohesion), with the likely result of sticking them together and potentially undergoing the same dynamical effect as dusty clumps. Moreover, small particles, below 1 mm in size, may be lost from the system under the influence of  solar radiation pressure (SRP), but even mm to cm\u2013size particles can have their orbits affected by SRP over a longer span <cit.>.\nWe may expect, instead, that more massive particles potentially levitate for some time, land on the surface and lift off again, repeating such cycles over and over, or just land at latitudes from which further lift off is not possible. Alternatively, they may enter mostly unstable orbits and even transfer to the secondary. \n\n<cit.> studied the effect of particle lofting due to YORP spin up in a binary system, namely 1999 KW4 (Moshup). They found that transferring angular momentum from the primary to the mutual orbit is possible. Regulation of primary spin at the rate for which material lofting takes place may happen so that the orbital angular momentum of the secondary grows steadily. Apparently, lofting occurs in fast transient episodes separated by long periods of slow spin-up. The authors argue that the end state of the system evolution is likely the separation into two asteroids on closely related heliocentric orbits. That may be a potential origin for \u201casteroid pairs\u201d. \n\n<cit.> outlined the possibility of mass lifting as a general mechanism of regolith dispersal in fast spinning Near-Earth asteroids forming  \u201cdusty\u201d environment around such bodies.\n\n<cit.> investigated mass shedding from the surface of the primary of (65803) Didymos by a semi-analytical approach for shedding conditions. They determined  unstable surface areas by combining the analyses and numerical results of SSDEM\nsimulations. The authors  find a vast majority of the shedding mass is finally transferred to Dimorphos and leads to a cumulative growth which may cause a spiralling\u2013in orbit of the secondary, an effect going in the opposite direction to  <cit.> finding. Further work on failure modes and mass shedding processes was carried out by <cit.>.\n\n\n\nThe main goal of this work is to study the general dynamical features of this mechanism that may be acting on some of the NEA binary systems listed in Table 1. We use asteroid Didymos as a case study, assuming the best available knowledge to the time of developing the model. Obviously, the actual shape, volume and mass of that asteroid \u2013as well as other physical parameters of the system\u2013 will be constrained in much greater detail only after both the DART and Hera missions will characterize the binary system. \n\nHere we analyze the dynamical evolution of lifted particles as well as their preference for take\u2013off and landing areas on Didymos. We provide mass density distributions of the material that may currently be, or may have been present around it, assuming a given emission rate. \n\n The model set up to study particle dynamics in this system and its validation is introduced in Sec. 2; results are presented in Sec. 3 and 4, and  conclusions are discussed in Sec. 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MODEL DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Mass loss due to fast spin rate\n\nTo study under what conditions particles may leave the Didymos surface, we considered the available radar-based Didymos shape model, made of 1000 vertices and 1996 facets <cit.> (Future, updated work on this matter shall include the shape model of Didymos available after the DART mission). Test particles were initially assumed to be at rest at the geometric centre of each triangular facet. Particles size distribution follow a differential power law n(r) dn \u221d r^\u03ba dr, with  index \u03ba =  -3.5. \nWe sampled the following particle size range values:\n\nr_1 = 4.7   \u03bcm, r_2=0.1 mm, r_3 = 2.3 mm and r_4=5.3 cm. These are central values of the corresponding logarithmic size bins in which the overall size distribution is divided. In this way, we check  particle behaviour from  micron\u2013size,  very sensitive to solar radiation pressure,  to cm\u2013size \u2014which are typical values for dust grains ejected from active asteroids <cit.>\u2014 to multi\u2013cm size, affected only by gravity. Particle density is assumed to be 3500 kg/m^3, according to the L and LL meteorite analogue to the Didymos S spectral type <cit.>. \n\n\nIn the case local acceleration is directed outwards, a particle will take off from the surface and will evolve under the gravitational field of Didymos, the gravitational perturbations generated by the secondary and the Sun, and the solar radiation pressure (SRP), according to the corresponding equation of motion. Under this scheme, at the end of a given integration time, we calculate the total mass of ejected particles in each end state. Based on the trajectories of particles, we have defined four possible end states (ES): ES1, particles that lift off and land again on Didymos\u2019 surface; ES2, particles that remain in orbit; ES3, particles that are accreted onto the secondary; and ES4, particles that escape from the system (see Section <ref> for details).\nWe also estimate the mass density in the Didymos system environment as a function of colatitude, longitude, and distance from the surface of the primary. \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Equation of motion\n\n\nThe equation of motion of a particle in a spinning reference system fixed to the primary body can be written as:\n\n\n\n    d^2 \ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc1d/dt^2  = - \u2207\ud835\udc14_\ud835\udc0f\n        + W_2\ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc1d-\ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc0f \u2299/||\ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc1d-\ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc0f \u2299||^3 + W_3 [ \ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc0f \u2299-\ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc1d/||\ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc0f \u2299-\ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc1d||^3 - \ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc0f \u2299/r_P \u2299 ^3] +\n        +W_4 [ \ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc12/r^3_dS-\ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc12/r^3_PS]   + \u03c9\u00d7 (\ud835\udc2b_\ud835\udc1d\u00d7\u03c9) + 2 \ud835\udc2f_\ud835\udc1d\u00d7\u03c9\n\n\nIn that expression, bold characters are vectors, r_d is the primary to particle position vector, r_P \u2299 is the primary to the Sun position vector, r_dS is the position vector from the particle to the secondary, and r_PS is the primary to the secondary position vector, as shown in Figure <ref>. \nHere r_P \u2299 = r_d + r_d \u2299, where r_d \u2299 is the vector from the dust grain to the Sun. \nThe first term of Eq. <ref> corresponds to the gravitational field per unit mass of the polyhedral shape of the primary, corresponding to the definition in <cit.>; \n\nthe second term is the SRP contribution, where \nW_2 = (Q_pr/c)[E_\u2299/(4 \u03c0)][\u03c0 d^2/(4m_d)], the following terms are the solar and the secondary gravitational perturbations: W_3 = GM_\u2299 and W_4= GM_S;  the last two terms are the centripetal and Coriolis force, respectively. The Euler  force can be neglected in this scheme because the spin change is an extremely slow process, lasting orders of magnitude longer than any other change in particle motion. \nMoreover, G is the gravitational constant, M_P is the primary mass, M_S is the secondary mass, M_\u2299 is the mass of the Sun,  Q_pr is the efficiency of solar radiation pressure, which is Q_pr\u223c 1 for large absorbing grains <cit.>, c is the speed of light, E_\u2299 = 3.93 \u00d7 10^26 W is the total power radiated by the Sun, d is the particle diameter and m_d its mass: m_d=\u03c1_d  (\u03c0/6)d^3 , where \u03c1_d is particle density. \n\u03c9 is the angular velocity of the primary (\u03c9=2\u03c0 /T, where T is the rotational period) and v_d is the velocity of the particle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Description of the algorithm\n\n\nEq. <ref> is integrated numerically  using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. \nThe primary asteroid can be represented as a sphere or any polyhedral shape. In the first case, the surface of the primary is divided into a grid with N_\u03b8 colatitude (\u03b8) bins and N_\u03d5 longitude (\u03d5) bins; this grid is extended radially outwards into space with N_r radii (r) bins, forming a total of N_\u03b8\u00d7 N_\u03d5\u00d7 N_r cells. At the beginning, each sample particle is located at the geometrical centre of each surface cell. In the second case, each sample particle is located at the geometrical centre of each triangular facet of the polyhedron, and the N_\u03b8\u00d7 N_\u03d5\u00d7 N_r space grid is defined outside the body, from the point on the surface farthest from the centre of the body, r_F. The mass and particle density are computed in those cells. \n\nTo check the validity of the calculation, the primary asteroid was also modelled as a sphere, and the gravitational field of the corresponding homogeneous sphere was analytically calculated. In the general case, the gravitational field corresponding to the polyhedral model is computed following the guidelines given by <cit.> at each point in space. In both cases, a point-mass \n\nsecondary body is assumed. Dimorphos follows a circular orbit  on the equatorial plane of Didymos. Moreover, the position and orientation of the binary in the heliocentric ecliptic system are rigorously computed at each time step from its available ephemeris and system pole orientation. The position of the Sun, as seen from the primary, is also computed, and the shadow of the primary on the ejected particles is checked at each time step to set the SRP on each particle either on or off. The shadow produced by Dimorphos on Didymos is not taken into account, as it is less than 5% of the Didymos surface, smaller than other sources of uncertainty in the model. Particles are initially at rest on the surface. A detachment condition is applied to check whether any given particle has an outwards component of local acceleration, \nwhich depends strongly on the apparent centrifugal force in the rotating system of the primary. Detachment occurs when \u2211_iF_i\u00b7n > 0, where F_i stands for each force corresponding to the accelerations in Eq. <ref>, and n is the unit vector normal to the surface facet\n\nand directed outwards.\nParticles, once ejected from the surface of the primary, move in the gravitational field  of the two bodies plus the radiation pressure and gravitational perturbing forces of the Sun. \n\n\nBased on the trajectories of the particles, we define four final states,  as follows:\n\n    \n  * ES1, landing particles: particles with radial distance from the centre is equal to or less than r_F, the particle is checked to be outside or inside the surface defined by the shape model. In the first case, the integration process continues, otherwise, the algorithm finds the intersection between the trajectory of the particle and the facet of the shape model. The collision coordinates are recorded, and the particle is labelled as ES1.\n    \n  * ES2, orbiting particles: particles belong to this group if at the end of the integration time they are still in orbit.\n    \n  * ES3, particles accreted on Dimorphos: during numerical integration, the position of a given particle  with respect to Dimorphos is checked at every time step. The gravitational field of Dimorphos is considered as a point\u2013mass source. The case in which the distance between the particle and the position of Dimorphos is less than its equivalent radius,  is considered as a collision, and the particle is labelled as ES3.\n    \n  * ES4, escaping particles: particles located beyond 10^4 m from the centre of mass of Didymos belong to this group. \n    Even if the Hill's radius of the system is 75 km, the limit is set at 10 km  \n    distance from the centre of the system for practical reasons. This is a distance beyond which we found that only a negligible mass density contribution is missed from rare particles orbiting back from outer distance. In fact, mass density, even at the Dimorphos distance, is extremely small, and the density profile keeps decreasing further away. \n    \n    This has the benefit of hugely reducing  both the storage load and the computational cost with no effect on the mass density calculation.\n\n\n\n\n Figure <ref> shows the surface gravity map of the Didymos shape model of a non-rotating Didymos, built using a mass of 5.229 \u00d7 10^11 kg with homogeneous density. This is worked out considering that the overall size of Dimorphos, D_S\u2248 0.2   D_P, so that the relationship between masses is close to M_S/M_P\u223c 0.01. Lowest gravity regions are clearly located on the equatorial bulge (blue-green colour in Figure <ref>). \n\nWe assessed the difference between the gravity field of Didymos, taking into account its shape model, against a sphere of equal mass and density, by calculating the radial gravitational field. Obviously, differences are found close to the surface (until approximately 570 m), but both fields  converge at larger distances, as expected. \n\nIn our model, the difference between the spherical and the polyhedral shape of Didymos is in the definition of spatial cells. Given that the shape model represents an irregular surface, it is not possible to simply define a surface grid and extend it into space in a uniform way. Instead, we set the longitude and latitude grid  starting at the vertex of the triangular facet at the maximum distance to the centre  (r_F). For the Didymos shape model, this spherical inner grid surface starts at r_F=427 m, which is the smallest distance at which mass density outside the body is calculated. This is the minimum radial distance from which spatial density computation is performed.  In other words, this is the spherical surface from which the computation of the mass density is made outside Didymos. The drawback of this approach is that no information is available inside the tiny region in between the shape model surface and the beginning of the 3D grid. \n\n\nAs for the modelling of the shadow cone produced by Didymos, given the  moderate depart of the asteroid shape from sphericity, for the sake of simplicity a profile corresponding to a sphere of radius r_F is assumed instead of the shape model itself. That approach has the advantage to save  computing time, with a negligible impact on the volume of the projected shadow cone. In addition, in order to save CPU time, the gravity field of the primary is approximated by its corresponding spherical field at r > 550 m, given the proximity of spherical and polyhedral solutions at that distance. The relative error is less than 3% at that point, decreasing at higher values of r.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code input data are the orbital and physical parameters of the system extracted from the mentioned Hera Didymos Reference Model (ESA internal document). Further inputs are the perihelion epoch, the dates of start and end of integration, the integration time step used in the Runge-Kutta procedure, the mass loss rate, and  particles  properties, i.e.,\n\nparticles radii, their density and the exponent of their size frequency distribution (SFD). \n\nOther running parameters are also given: the number of particle size bins, which are conveniently spaced logarithmically to be consistent with the power-law distribution, the time bins, \nthe radius limit for mass density computation, and the escaping distance, i.e., the distance at which particles are considered to escape the system and no longer contribute to density in the considered space range. See Sec. <ref> and <ref> for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Time integration procedure\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the image of a comet tail, we need to keep in mind that particles were ejected from the comet surface at any time before the time at which the image was taken, let's call that time t \u2264 T_obs.\nA similar situation can be envisioned in the case of  Didymos ejected particles.\nThe following numerical procedure for reproducing such a situation is applied. \n\nLet's call T_start the time at which the program checks, for the first time, the particle surface detachment condition at any given surface facet. The final T_obs time is instead the time at which the calculation of the particle mass and number density is made (in the analogy above, this corresponds to the time at which the observation of the system environment is made). The total integration time is T_obs-T_start, which is divided by the number of time intervals\nn_t, so that \n\u0394 t=(T_obs-T_start)/n_t is the length of each time integration period. One sample particle of each size is located on every surface facet. At the beginning (T_start),  the detachment condition for each particle size is checked, if this is met, the sample particle starts its motion under the action of the corresponding forces by a 4th\u2013order R-K integrator, with an integration time step H. This is done for all particle sizes. \nMany different values for the R-K integration time step were tried, the value finally adopted corresponds to the largest one safely allowing for convergence in the integration.\nOnce integration is over, that is, at t=T_obs, the same procedure is repeated at the initial time T_start + \u0394 t (\u0394 t>>H), and so on.\nThis is necessary because we need to consider the evolution of particles potentially leaving their facet  at all n_t equally spaced times between T_start and T_obs.\nThe same process is carried out for all surface facets. \nIn this way, the emission of sample particles is checked along the whole integration time. At time T_obs, the number of particles in orbit (ES2) is counted at each space cell. Instead, particles that hit the surface of the primary or the secondary (ES1, ES3), or reach the escape distance (ES4) at some time, do not contribute to  space density (ES2), but their end state is recorded.\nAt the end of the whole integration time for all surface facets, the data corresponding to the end\u2013state of all sample particles are stored, as well as their position in space and mass density as a function of longitude, colatitude and radial distance from the centre of Didymos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Mass density calculation\n\n\n\nOnce the end state of sample particles is known, it is necessary to calculate the absolute mass in each end state. Therefore, we face the problem of how to translate sample particle statistics into the corresponding actual mass  in each end state.\n\nFirst of all, we need to make assumptions on the mass emission rate; in addition, the mass and number of particles have to be scaled with the adopted SFD.\n\nActive asteroids show a diversity of mass\u2013loss mechanisms including sublimation, impacts, fast rotation, electrostatics, thermal effects, etc. Estimates of rotation mass shedding in fast spinning rubble-pile asteroids range from 10^-7 kg/s, reported for asteroid (101955) Bennu <cit.>, to 2.3 kg/s <cit.>, and 35 kg/s <cit.> in the case of (6478) Gault. Episodic mass losses ranging from 1 to 10 kg/s have been derived for multi\u2013tailed asteroid P/2013 P5 (PANSTARRS) <cit.>, which can be clearly attributed to mass shedding due to rotational instability <cit.>.\nTo date, no observation of this kind of activity has been reported for Didymos, so this parameter is unknown. For this reason, we considered a constant reference value of mass production rate for Didymos, that was set arbitrarily to dM/dt = 1 kg/s for the whole asteroid. A suitable fraction of such value is used only for cells for which the lift off condition is met, no particle will be ejected  for most surface cells far from the equator though. \nThe contribution of ejected particles to the mass  and number density  in each space cell is computed as follows. The mass ejected per unit surface area is calculated as \n(dM/dt)/(4\u03c0 R_p^2), where dM/dt is the assumed mass production rate on the whole surface, R_p is the Didymos radius, and the mass ejected per surface cell in a time interval \u0394 t^' is:\n\n\n    M_cell=1/4\u03c0 R_p^2dM/dt S_cell\u0394 t^'\n\n\nwhere S_cell is the area of the surface cell.  The total mass is distributed according to the already mentioned SFD in the radius range [r_min, r_max].\n\nIn a given  size bin [r_i, r_j] within such range,  the number of particles emitted from each cell in a given time interval is: \n\n\n    N_bin= M_cell3/41/\u03c0\u03c1_particle\u222b_r_i^r_j r^\u03ba dr/\u222b_r_min^r_max r^\u03ba+3 dr\n\n\nand the corresponding emitted mass is: \n\n\n    M_bin=N_bin4/3\u03c0\u03c1_particle\u222b_r_i^r_j r^\u03ba+3 dr/\u222b_r_i^r_j r^\u03ba dr\n\n\nThe mass and the number of particles are updated accordingly in every space cell where sample particles are located at the end of  integration. The mass and number of particles are finally divided by the cell volume to get the corresponding mass and number density. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Model validation\n\n\nIn order to check the validity of our model when applied to the polyhedral representation of solid bodies, we compared the results obtained for the dynamical evolution of particles departing from analytical and polyhedral representations of a spherical body made of 5120 facets (see Figure <ref>).\nIn both cases, the same mass and equivalent size of Didymos were used, M_P=5.229\u00d710^11 kg and R=400 m, respectively. The density profiles are in very good agreement even at small distances from the body surface. Simulations were run over 30 days. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SUMMARY OF MODEL SIMULATIONS\n\n\nThe current Didymos system physical parameters are known with  wide uncertainties (see Sec. 1).   \nFor this reason, we first mapped the mass\u2013volume parameter space and related each pair of values with the corresponding total orbiting mass obtained by our model. Then, we focused on the nominal parameters for the Didymos mass and size and we performed a detailed analysis of  particle  detachment and landing process by means of numerical simulations. The wide heliocentric distance of the Didymos system \u2014due to its high eccentricity\u2014 led us to study the particle behaviour around very different locations (perihelion and aphelion) of the system, and under the corresponding initial epoch conditions, in the case of full orbit integrations.\nThe whole set of simulations carried out is outlined next.\n\n\n    \n  * Simulation 1: Conditions for mass lift-off. \n    \n    The first goal is to study under what conditions it is possible to find mass around the primary. Thus, we combined 7 values of each mass and volume parameters of Didymos within estimated uncertainty. That resulted in 49 numerical runs, one per each corresponding value of  bulk density (see Table <ref>). We let the system evolve during 30 days, near the perihelion epoch, starting on August 28, 2020 and ending on September 26, 2020. Performing simulation runs around perihelion is the worst case for particle survival, as SRP is more efficient in perturbing their motion and taking particles away from the system.\n   \n   \n  * Simulation 2: Evolution in one full orbit (starting at perihelion). \n    \n    Here we used the nominal mass and volume of Didymos in order to set its nominal bulk density. The simulation was run over a full heliocentric orbit of Didymos (770 days), starting and ending around the perihelion epoch (from August 28, 2020 to October 7, 2022). \n    The behaviour of small (r_1, r_2 and r_3) and large (r_4) particles were analyzed separately to study the effect of the SRP.\n    \n   \n    \n  * Simulation 3: Evolution in one full orbit (starting at aphelion).\n    \n    We used the same physical parameters as in Simulation 2, but the simulation was run over a full heliocentric orbit of Didymos (770 days), starting and ending around the aphelion epoch (from September 15, 2021 to October 25, 2023). Again, the analysis of small and large particles was done separately. \n    \n    \n  * Simulation 4: Short term evolution around perihelion.\n    \n    Here we report the results of Simulation 1 again for the nominal  mass and volume of Didymos primary. The system evolved over 30 days around the perihelion epoch, starting on August 28, 2020 and ending on September 26, 2020. \n    \n    \n    \n  * Simulation 5: Short term evolution around aphelion. \n    Analogous to Simulation 4, but over 30 days near the aphelion epoch, starting on September 15, 2021 and ending on October 15, 2021.\n    \n    \nWe run short term (30 days) simulations to be able to catch the main features of the  orbiting mass for the whole set of 49  runs in Simulation 1 and to underline (Simulations 4 and 5) the dependence of the outcome for small particles on the observation epoch. \nThis choice, in the case of Simulation 1, was motivated, on one hand,  by the fact that full orbit simulations are very time consuming. On the other hand,   the behaviour of particles \u2014as far as mass distribution is concerned\u2014 does not change around a given epoch, beyond some 20  days. Therefore, we considered a safe strategy to perform 30\u2013day runs around the least favorable epoch for particle survival.\n \n\n\n\nOrbital parameters used in  simulations are shown in  Table 2. Table 3 summarizes the volume and mass parameter space ranges, and the system physical parameters are introduced in Table 4. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RESULTS\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Conditions for mass lift-off (Simulation 1)\n\n\nIn Figure <ref>, each square gives the orbiting mass at the end of each simulation after 30 days around perihelion, normalized to the maximum orbiting mass value. The central cross corresponds to the nominal case, which will be analyzed further in the next sections (Simulations 2 to 5). Particle detachment takes place at the nominal spin rate for most values in the chosen Didymos physical parameter space, except for three parameter combinations (see Table <ref>). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Particle evolution after one full orbit (Simulations 2 and 3)\n\n\nIn Simulation 2 and 3, we analyze particle end states after they leave the surface and the corresponding lifetimes (Table <ref>).\nDepending on size, more than 97  %   of particles fall back onto the surface of the primary (ES1). The time required to land back also depends on particle size. In general, for any ES, the larger the particle, the longer its lifetime. Particles of radius r_1 spend on average 0.81 h orbiting the asteroid before landing on its surface, while particles r_4 may orbit more than 4 hours before landing. In addition, as expected, most  particles that escape  the system (ES4) correspond to size r_1. However, that end state probability is only 2.81%. When such particles pass from the shadow cone generated by the asteroid to the illuminated region, they are quickly removed from the system, typically after 6 hours. On the contrary, a small fraction of r_2, r_3 and r_4 size particles are eliminated, and they are able to survive in the environment of the asteroid between 37 and 600 hours, before they are removed. Instead, particles that are accreted onto the secondary (ES3) are mostly r_4, followed by r_3. Such particles stay in orbit for some 100 and 81 hours, respectively, before reaching Dimorphos. r_1 and r_2  particles have lower probabilities of reaching the moonlet, taking 2.5 to 4 hours, driven by SRP. At the end of the integration time, there are mostly large particles orbiting the system. r_3 size particles are able to stay in orbit about 46 h in Simulation 2 and 74 hours in Simulation 3, and this difference is  related to still some weak interaction with SRP\nat such size range. On the other hand, r_4 particles have a median lifetime in orbit of \u223c 100 hours and no influence of the SRP is detectable any longer.\n\nThese results can be easily understood by comparing the effect of the gravitational force (F_g) due to Didymos on any given  particle, with respect to the corresponding solar radiation force (F_rad), as a function of the distance to the centre of the asteroid (a):\n\n\n\n\n    F_g/F_rad=4/3G  M_P c \u03c1_d  d/2/Q_pr F_\u22991/a^2\n \n\n\nF_\u2299 = E_\u2299 / 4 \u03c0 a^2 is the solar flux at the heliocentric distance of the asteroid system, and the other parameters are the same as in Section <ref>. \nThe ratio between the two force contributions is plotted in Figure <ref>. A  horizontal gray line separates the distance to Didymos  into two regimes, one is dominated by gravity and the other one by solar radiation force. The gray vertical line shows the distance to Dimorphos and the coloured curves represent the relationship between the two mentioned forces for different particle  sizes. Solid and dashed curves correspond to motion around  perihelion and  aphelion, respectively. Particles of size r_1 evolve almost completely under the action of SRP, whereas particles of size r_2 are affected by both SRP and F_g. Instead, motion of particles of size r_3 and r_4 are dominated by the force of gravity. That implies that  there is no smooth transition between the behaviour of the particles of size r_1 and r_3 and the corresponding mean lifetimes in ES2.\n\nLifetimes are shorter around perihelion (Simulation 2) than around aphelion (Simulation 3) due to different SRP force values. These results are comparable with the work by <cit.>. They also show that, in such low-gravity environment, SRP plays an important role in the dynamics of small dust grains. Instead, particles larger than a few millimetres are mostly affected by the Didymos gravitational force within the orbit of Dimorphos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Density distribution of orbiting mass\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Small particles\n\n\nHere, we focus on the analysis of the behaviour of small particles (r_1, r_2 and r_3) that are in ES2 at the end of Simulations 2, 3, 4 and 5.\nMass density profiles as a function of radial distance from the asteroid centre are shown in Figure <ref> (top). This is obtained by integrating on each cell in colatitude and longitude at any given radial distance. Plots begin at r_F=427 m, the origin of spatial cells. \n\nIn density profiles, maxima are found at r\u223c475 m in the case of Simulations 2 and 4, at r\u223c481 m in Simulation 3, and at r\u223c458 m in Simulation 5. Therefore, the largest mass density of orbiting particles is  31 to 54 meters above the mentioned reference distance from the centre r_F.\nBeyond such distance, mass density steadily decreases, as expected. As a result, orbiting mass density in simulation  runs around perihelion (Simulation 4) is smaller than for the corresponding simulations around aphelion (Simulation 5).\n\nThis is due to the strong influence of SRP on small particles.\nThe outcome of density profiles for 30 days integration time are very similar to those obtained integrating over a full orbit of the system around the Sun. This is the case both for perihelion and aphelion epoch starting time. Therefore, the amount of small particles in the system environment  at a given time  strongly depends on the epoch at which the mass density observation is made.\n\nThe colatitude density profile (See Figure <ref>, bottom), together with the radial density profile, show that orbiting particles are mostly located in a thin disk, with maximum density on the equatorial plane. However, the disk is not symmetrical at north and south of the equator due to Didymos topographical shape model  inhomogeneities. On the northern hemisphere, landing location is spread over 25 degrees, between 65^\u2218 and 90^\u2218 of colatitude, while, on the southern hemisphere, the distribution extends up to 30 degrees, between 90^\u2218 and 120^\u2218 colatitude. The density mass difference between  observation  about perihelion and aphelion is also shown in the colatitude profile (Figure <ref>, bottom). \n\nThe analysis of particle motion and mass density shows that although most  ejected particles return to the surface of the primary with short orbit lifetimes (a few hours), a continuous lift off process supplies them into space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Large particles\n\nThis section extends the analysis of results including particles of radius r_4, not affected by SRP. Figure <ref> shows the corresponding radial and colatitude mass distributions. This also  applies to any object of size larger than r_4, as they are only affected by gravitational and non\u2013inertial force terms.\n\n\nWhen large particles are considered, there is no  substantial difference in orbital mass density at aphelion with respect to perihelion, although the radial density profile at aphelion (Simulation 5) is slightly larger than the corresponding density at perihelion (Simulation 4) over the whole considered domain. Large particles are the greatest contributors to orbiting mass density, which is equal around both epochs. Instead, small particles contribute more at aphelion than perihelion, building up the very small difference between densities observed around the two different epochs (see Figure <ref>).\n The disk\u2013like distribution of particles in orbit at a given time is shown in Figure <ref>, in the case of Simulation 4.\n\n \n\nIt is interesting to notice that the probability (p_2(r)) for small particles to have an orbital end state (ES2)  is smaller as size decreases (see Table 5). Similarly, duration of orbits is shorter for small particles with respect to large ones (\u03b4 t_2(r), normalized). Both effects combine in the size frequency distribution of particles found to be in orbit at  a given time, that can be described as n_o(r)dn= n (r)dn   p_2(r) \u03b4 t_2(r)  dr\u221d r^-3.5  p_2(r) \u03b4 t_2(r)  dr \u221d r^\u03ba_o  dr, with \u03ba_o\u2248 -3. In summary, the SFD of particles    observed   in orbit (ES2) looks to be shallower than the original asteroid surface population assumption (\u03ba= -3.5), and is therefore skewed towards large  particles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Distribution of landing particles\n\nFigure <ref> shows \u2014for Simulation 5, as an example\u2014 a mass density colour map distribution of the initial position of particles that are able to lift off the surface. \nAt the beginning of any run, particles lie at the geometrical centre of the shape model triangular facets; hence a discrete distribution shows up in Figure <ref>. \nThe detachment area surrounds the equatorial plane, but it is not symmetrical with respect to it. The maximum detachment latitudes to the north and to the south of the equator are \u03b8_N \u223c 28 ^\u2218 and \u03b8_S \u223c 19 ^\u2218, respectively, in all the cases, in Simulations 2 to 5. After detachment, most lifted particles (more than 97%) land back on the surface of the primary. Figure <ref> (bottom) shows landing locations after 30 days of evolution.\nDuring this time, the gravitational field of Didymos, the gravitational perturbation of Sun and Dimorphos, and SRP, modify particle trajectories, increasing their orbital inclination and allowing them to reach mid and high landing  latitudes, typically higher in comparison with the detachment positions. The colour map shows that the density distribution peak in colatitude lies near the equatorial plane. It is important to note that particles  landing at low latitudes can likely leave the surface again. Indeed, such  particles are a reservoir for later material ejection. Instead, particles falling at mid and high latitudes would not be dynamically able to lift off again from their new location. \n\nHowever, mass sliding mechanism towards low latitudes are known to have taken place on asteroids Bennu and Ryugu <cit.>, such effect may drive mass back to the equatorial region, re\u2013fuelling the take off and landing process. Figure <ref> (top) shows  non-homogeneous landing distribution in longitude. This behaviour is related to the topography of the asteroid in the equatorial region. Particles flight heights are low, so lifted-particles preferentially land on relatively high terrains around the equator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nPrimary fast spin up in NEA binary systems is relatively common. We study the possibility that mass is able to take off the surface of such bodies, taking (65803) Didymos NEA binary system as a study case because it is the DART (NASA) and Hera (ESA) space missions target.\nThe latest available shape model for the asteroid at the time of carrying on this study was used.\nWe set up a model to study the dynamical behaviour of the particles that are able to take off the surface  due to the primary fast spin. The gravitational field of the asteroid is taken into account, together with all non\u2013inertial forces in the asteroid rotating frame. Perturbations due to the satellite, Dimorphos, and to the Sun are suitably considered, as well as  SRP. \n\nWe explored the Didymos primary mass and volume parameter space to assess under what asteroid density conditions particle detachment from the surface is possible. We find that most values in that parameter space  allow for particle  lift off. In the nominal case, that is possible in a region limited to the (+28^\u2218, -19^\u2218) latitude interval around the equatorial plane, non\u2013symmetric due to the primary irregular shape.\nAvailable range of mass and volume estimates is compatible with the possibility of having a disc of particles of different sizes around Didymos. The actual mass density is hard to predict as the rate of mass emission is unknown. Nevertheless, our model finds the distributions in colatitude and distance from the asteroid according to assumed parameters. Maximum values for the mass density distribution show up at very low latitudes and at some 30 to 50 m away from the average primary equatorial radius, decreasing steadily at larger distance.\n\nMost  lifted particles (>97%) do land back on the surface, with variable lifetimes depending on size, but typically smaller than 5 h. Small particles have shorter lifetimes than large ones because of  SRP. In fact, when small particles take off on the day side of the asteroid, they are quickly pushed back to the surface, and their flight time is shorter the stronger the SRP is. When such particles take off in the night side, they follow ballistic trajectories until they typically land back or, in the case they reach the terminator, they are pushed away from the system by SRP.\nParticle landing locations are not evenly distributed in longitude, concentrating instead in equatorial morphology highs. This is because   most particles only reach low altitudes with respect to their original take off location, and they eventually stumble into such highs on their flight path. It is interesting to notice that the latitude landing range distribution is wider than that of lift off distribution location. As a consequence, some particles may land at latitudes from which they can no longer  take off. \n\n\nSRP has an important effect on small particle dynamics, to the point that, for such particles, mass density in space happens to be a function of the orbital phase at which it is observed (T_obs). \nDidymos has a very eccentric orbit, such that heliocentric distance changes from 1.013 to 2.276 au. This results in very different contributions from the solar tide and SRP at different distance  from the Sun. Total mass surrounding Didymos at aphelion is more than double (\u2248 9/4) than at perihelion for sub\u2013cm size particles. \n\nInstead, looking at the overall mass in orbit, including large particles \u2014not affected by SRP\u2014 no significant difference is found, due to the contribution of large particles to total mass. The size distribution of particles in orbit should be shallower (\u03ba\u2248 -3) than their size distribution on the asteroid (\u03ba=-3.5) due to smaller probability and lifetime in orbit of small particles with respect to large ones.\n\nIn conclusion, our model shows that the presence of mass in orbit around   Didymos, or similarly shaped fast spinning NEAs, is possible. That includes the potential presence of boulders around the system, that may eventually  reach the secondary (\u2248 2% probability) at this stage.\nIn any case, as outlined in Section <ref>, the existence and  observability of mass around the system may depend on which primary rotational phase and which secondary orbital phase Didymos is undergoing at the observation time, according to the mechanism described by <cit.>. \n\nRight after the completion of this study, the DART spacecraft successfully impacted Dimorphos, and first results derived from the images of both the DRACO camera on board DART and the LEIA and LUKE cameras on board the CubeSat LICIACube (ASI: Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) have been published <cit.>. \n<cit.> report a set of freshly estimated values for the critical parameters in this study: the mass of the system, (5.6\u00b1 0.5)\u00d7 10^11 kg; the equatorial extents, 850\u00b1 5 m on average; the equivalent diameter of both Didymos, 761\u00b1 26 m, and Dimorphos, 151\u00b1 5 m (uncertainties are given at 1-\u03c3 level). Therefeore, the mass of Didymos can also be easily estimated, assuming equal density for the two bodies. We are conscious that the Didymos shape model is preliminary, however, such set of parameters tends to confirm the possibility of mass lift off from the equatorial region of Didymos.  In fact, even in the worst case compatible with available uncertainty ranges (largest system mass, smallest  Dimorphos equivalent diameter, largest Didymos equivalent diameter, and smallest Didymos equatorial extent), the ratio between the centripetal and gravitational acceleration at the equator, a_c/g=\u03c9^2r_eq^3/(GM_P) is larger than 1 (1.07), indicating outwards acceleration.  a_c/g is the driving magnitude here (rather than density), where \u03c9 is the spin rate and r_eq is the equatorial radius of Didymos. The nominal values from <cit.> give  a_c/g=1.235, which is very close to the (M_1, V_4) set, providing more mass in orbit than our nominal case. \na_c/g=1 for r_eq^'=396 m, which is the minimum distance from the spin axis at which lift off is possible, some 30 m smaller than the estimated equatorial radius extent.\n\nIt is interesting to notice that the estimated bulk density is reported as 2400\u00b1 300 kg/m^3, a value that would inhibit mass shedding on a sphere spinning at the Didymos spin rate. \nThe bulk density of a body is the critical parameter only in the case in which its shape is fixed. Comparing a sphere with an equal mass oblate spheroid with equatorial axis a and shortest axis c, the corresponding critical spin rate is \n\n\n    \u03c9_cr^'=\u221a(4 \u03c0 G \u03c1^'/3c/a)\n\n\nAt equal critical spin rate, the relationship between the density of the oblate shaped and the spherical body is \u03c1^'/\u03c1=a/c. \nE.g., for an oblate body with a/c=1.37 (the case of Didymos, as its extent along spin axis is estimated to be 620\u00b1 15 m by <cit.>), the critical density is \u03c1^'=2924 kg/m^3, while, for an equal mass spherical Didymos, it would be \u03c1=2134 kg/m^3.\n\n\nIndications of the presence of dust around Didymos can be envisioned by  looking at the LICIACube images. However, we prefer to avoid speculation at this point, and we delay further interpretation to a forthcoming companion paper. Once further estimate improvement of the main physical parameters and an updated Didymos shape model \u2013pre-Hera mission\u2013 will be available, a refined model will be carried out on the \u201creal\u201d Didymos system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also plan to study the interplay between mass ejected from Dimorphos by the DART impact and the stationary mass distribution around the system \u2013if any. In fact, that may potentially affect the actual mass density  to be estimated by the Hera rendezvous with the Didymos system in 2027 and the calibration of instrumentation on board. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nNT, ACB and PBL acknowledge funding by the NEO-MAPP project through grant agreement 870377, in the frame of the EC H2020-SPACE-2019.
