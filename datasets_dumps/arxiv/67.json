It has been used implicitely first in <cit.> and explicitely introduced in the context of network coding in <cit.>. One of the main reasons why this metric has been in the spotlight in recent years is the fact that sum-rank metric codes outperform the more classical ones in\nterms of the required field size to construct codes achieving the Singleton bound in the corresponding metric <cit.>. This is due to the existence of the so-called linearized Reed\u2013Solomon codes, a family of maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes with polynomial field sizes. \nIn the survey paper <cit.>, the interested reader may find a very\ndetailed summary on properties and applications of sum-rank\nmetric codes in distributed storage systems, network coding, and multi-antenna communication.\n\nThe main purpose of this paper is to further study the structure, parameters and constructions of minimal codes in the sum-rank metric, recently introduced in <cit.>. Minimal codes are classical objects in the Hamming metric rich of connections with different areas of mathematics, such as cryptography <cit.>, finite geometry <cit.>, and combinatorics <cit.>. One of the main concerns about these objects is to find bounds on their parameters. In particular, one difficult problem is to know how short they can be and to construct short minimal codes. In <cit.> lower bounds on the length of minimal codes are proved, whereas in <cit.> the best known upper bounds on the length of the shortest minimal codes are presented. These last are implicit existence results. Some short constructions are illustrated in <cit.> and in the upcoming <cit.>. More recently, minimal codes in the rank metric have been introduced <cit.> together with some bounds and construction. In particular, their geometry is studied, in connection with linear sets. Such codes reveal to be useful in the construction of MRD codes <cit.> or for the covering problem in the rank metric\n<cit.>. Still a direct application to cryptography of these objects is missing from the party, even if rank-metric minimal codes may be used to construct minimal codes in the Hamming metric. We will show that the same holds for minimal sum-rank metric codes.\n\n\nAfter recalling some main definitions and results in the preliminary Section <ref>, we introduce the main object of the paper in Section <ref>: exploiting the geometry of sum-rank metric codes studied in <cit.>, we prove first that minimal sum-rank metric codes correspond to collections of linear sets whose union forms a strong blocking set, that is a set of points in the projective space whose intersection with every hyperplane spans the hyperplane. This allows to easily get a bound on the maximum weight of minimal sum-rank metric codes, together with a characterization of minimal MSRD codes. Standard equations allow us to prove some bounds on the parameters of minimal sum-rank metric codes (see Theorem <ref>) presented also in their asymptotic version. We then focus on some existence results of short minimal sum-rank metric codes, obtained by implicit counting arguments. Section\u00a0<ref> is devoted to a tool that we call geometric dual: we make use of the dual of _q-subspaces of _q^m-vector spaces studied in <cit.> to build the dual of systems associated to sum-rank metric codes and we call geometric dual the code associated to these dual systems. We prove first that such object is well-defined and we show a sort of MacWilliams' relations between the generalized weight enumerators (see Theorem <ref>). Moreover, we prove that the geometric dual is involutory. In Section\u00a0<ref>, we come back to the core of the paper, which are minimal codes in the sum-rank metric. By the correspondence between sum-rank metric codes and Hamming-metric ones, we first highlight a generalization of the celebrated Ashikhmin-Barg condition, which is a sufficient condition on the weight distribution for a code to be minimal (see Theoreom <ref>). All one-weight codes result to be minimal, but remarkably there are many more one-weight codes in the sum-rank metric than in the two more classical ones. After recalling three families of one-weight sum-rank metric codes introduced in <cit.>, we read the property of being one-weight in the geometric dual, which exchanges the role of hyperplanes and points. As a consequence, we get that partitions in scattered linear sets yield one-weight codes. Doubly extended linearized Reed-Solomon of dimension 2, which correspond partition of the projective line in scattered linear sets, are short minimal codes (that meet the bound in Theorem <ref>) whose geometric dual are one-weight which are short minimal codes for quadratic extensions. We use this partition of the projective line to construct a partition of higher dimension projective spaces, yielding other examples of one-weight codes. Another construction may be done with canonical subgeometries. Finally, we show that every sum-rank metric code can be extended to a one-weight code, showing that there are several examples of one-weight codes with different geometric structures. In the last part of the section, we study some two-weight codes: these can be easily obtained by considering proper subsets of mutually disjoint scattered linear sets and taking the geometric dual of the associated codes (see Theorem <ref>). Thanks to the Ashikhmin-Barg condition, we have that if the number of blocks is sufficiently large, then such codes are minimal  (see Theorem <ref>). We finally present some examples of minimal two-weight codes with two blocks and, quite remarkably, in dimension 3 we are able to prove the minimality  by direct geometric arguments for codes not satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition (see Theorem <ref>). Let us point out that their associated Hamming metric codes have few weights and in some cases they are two-weights: this make them particularly interesting for several reasons including quantum codes and strongly regular graphs; see <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 PRELIMINARIES\n\n\nIn this section we will briefly recall the main results of the theory of sum-rank metric codes and linear sets, which we will use in the rest of the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Basic notions on sum-rank metric codes\n\n\nThroughout the paper,\n\ud835\udc27=(n_1,\u2026,n_t) \u2208\u2115^t denotes an ordered tuples with n_1 \u2265 n_2 \u2265\u2026\u2265 n_t and N = n_1+\u2026+n_t. We use the following compact notations for the direct sum of vector spaces \n\n    _q^m^=\u2295_i=1^t_q^m^n_i.\n\n\nLet start by recalling that the rank of a vector v=(v_1,\u2026,v_n) \u2208_q^m^n is defined as (v)=_ (\u27e8 v_1,\u2026, v_n\u27e9_) and the sum-rank weight of an element x=(x_1 ,\u2026, x_t) \u2208_q^m^ is \n\n    w(x)=\u2211_i=1^t (x_i).\n\n\n\n    If t=1, then the sum-rank weight is simply the rank, whereas if n_1=\u2026=n_t=1, the sum-rank weight coincides with the Hamming weight. The sum-rank metric constitues then a bridge between the rank and the Hamming metrics. \n\n\nWe also call rank-list of x=(x_1,\u2026,x_t) \u2208_q^m^ the vector\n\n    ((x_1),\u2026,(x_t)).\n\nHence, the sum-rank weight of a vector corresponds to the sum of the entries of its rank-list.\n\n\nA (linear) sum-rank metric code  is an _q^m-subspace of _q^m^ endowed with the sum-rank distance defined as\n\n    d(x,y)=w(x-y)=\u2211_i=1^t (x_i-y_i),\n\nwhere x=(x_1 , \u2026 , x_t), y=(y_1 , \u2026, y_t) \u2208_q^m^. \nLet \u2286_q^m^ be a sum-rank metric code. We will write that  is an [,k,d]_q^m/q code (or [,k]_q^m/q code) if k is the _q^m-dimension of  and d is its minimum distance, that is \n\n    d=d()=min{d(x,y)  x, y \u2208, x \u2260 y  }.\n    \n\n\nLet \u2286_q^m^\ud835\udc27 be a linear sum-rank metric code. Let G=(G_1|\u2026| G_t) \u2208_q^m^k \u00d7 N be a generator matrix of , that is a matrix whose lines generate , with G_1,\u2026,G_t \u2208_q^m^k \u00d7n_i. We define  to be nondegenerate if the columns of G_i are -linearly independent for i\u2208{1,\u2026,t} (this is independent of the choice of G; see <cit.>).\n\nWe will only consider nondegenerate codes in this paper and this is not a restriction since we can always embed a sum-rank metric code in a smaller space in which it results to be nondegenerate, preserving its metric properties.\nSo, throughout this paper we will omit the term nondegenerate and all codes considered will be nondegenerate.\n\n\n\nFor sum-rank metric codes the following Singleton-like bound holds; see also <cit.>.\n\n  \n     Let \ud835\udc9e be an  code. Then \n     \n    d \u2264 N-k+1.\n\n\n\n\nAn  code is called a Maximum Sum-Rank Distance code (or shortly MSRD code) if d=N-k+1.\n\n\n\nThe next result classifies the -linear isometries of _q^m^ equipped with the sum-rank distance, cfr. <cit.> and <cit.>.\nBefore stating it, we need the following notation. \nLet \u2113:=|{n_1,\u2026,n_t}| and let n_i_1,\u2026,n_i_\u2113 be the distinct elements of {n_1,\u2026,n_t}.\nBy \u03bb(\ud835\udc27)\u2208^\u2113 we will denote the vector whose entries are\n\n    \u03bb_j:=|{k  n_k=n_i_j}|,     j\u2208{1,\u2026,\u2113}.\n\nFor a vector v=(v_1,\u2026, v_\u2113)\u2208\u2115^\u2113, we define \n    S_v=S_v_1\u00d7\u22ef\u00d7 S_v_\u2113,\n\nwhere S_i is the symmetric group of order i and naturally acts on the blocks of length i. \nSimilarly, we denote by (v, _q) the direct product of the general linear groups of degree v_i over _q, i.e.\n\n    (\ud835\udc2f, _q) = (v_1, _q)\u00d7\u2026\u00d7(v_t, _q).\n\n\n\nThe group of _q^m-linear isometries of the space (_q^m^,d)  is\n\n    ((_q^m^\u2217)^t\u00d7(, _q)) \u22ca\ud835\udcae_\u03bb(),\n\nwhich (right)-acts as \n  \n    (x_1 , \u2026, x_t)\u00b7 (\ud835\udc1a,A_1,\u2026, A_t,\u03c0) \u27fc (a_1x_\u03c0(1)A_1 |\u2026| a_tx_\u03c0(t) A_t).\n\n\n\nWe use the -linear isometries of the whole ambient space to define the equivalence of sum-rank metric codes.\n\n \nTwo  sum-rank metric codes _1, _2 are equivalent if there is an -linear isometry \u03d5, such that \u03d5(_1)=_2. The set of equivalence classes of  sum-rank metric codes is denoted by \u212d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The geometry of sum-rank metric codes\n\n\nWe will recall now some results from <cit.>, on the connections between sum-rank metric codes and some sets of subspaces.\n\nThe following definition extends the notion of projective systems and q-systems; cfr. <cit.>.\n\n \nAn [\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q-system (or simply an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q-system) U is an ordered set (U_1,\u22ef,U_t), where, for any i\u2208{1,\u2026, t}, U_i is an _q-subspace of _q^m^k of dimension n_i, such that\n\u27e8 U_1, \u2026, U_t \u27e9__q^m=_q^m^k and \n\n    d=N-max{\u2211_i=1^t__q(U_i\u2229 H) | H  is an _q^m-hyperplane of _q^m^k}.\n\nMoreover, two [\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q-systems (U_1,\u2026,U_t) and (V_1,\u2026, V_t) are equivalent if there exists  \u03c6\u2208(k,_q^m) and  \u03c3\u2208\ud835\udcae_t, such that\n\n    \u03c6(U_i) = a_iV_\u03c3(i),\n\nfor every i\u2208{1,\u2026,t}.\n\n\nWe denote the set of equivalence classes of [\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q-systems by \ud835\udd18[\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q.\n\nThe following result allows us to establish a connection between systems and codes.\n\n \nLet  be an [,k,d]_q^m/q. Let G=(G_1|\u2026| G_t) be a generator matrix of .\nLet U_i \u2286_q^m^k be the _q-span of the columns of G_i, for i\u2208{1,\u2026,t}.\nThe sum-rank weight of an element x G \u2208, with x=(x_1,\u2026,x_k) \u2208_q^m^k is\n\n    w(x G) = N - \u2211_i=1^t _(U_i \u2229 x^\u22a5),\n\nwhere x^\u22a5={y=(y_1,\u2026,y_k) \u2208_q^m^k \u2211_i=1^k x_iy_i=0}. In particular, the minimum distance of  reads as follows\n\n    d=N- max{\u2211_i=1^t _(U_i \u2229 H)   H_q^m_q^m^k  }.\n\nSo (U_1,\u2026,U_t) in an [,k,d]_q^m/q-system. \n\n\n\nNote that, as a consequence of (<ref>), the rank-list of a codeword x G of   is given by\n\n    (n_1-_(U_1 \u2229 x^\u22a5),\u2026,n_t-_(U_t \u2229 x^\u22a5)).\n\n\n\n\nAs in <cit.>, we can then observe that there is a one-to-one  correspondence  between  equivalence  classes  of  sum-rank nondegenerate [\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q code and equivalence classes of [\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q-systems via two maps\n\n    \u03a8 :  \u212d[\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q   \u2192\ud835\udd18[\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q\n    \u03a6 : \ud835\udd18[\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q   \u2192\u212d[\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q,\n\nthat act as follows.\nFor any []\u2208\u212d[\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q, let G=(G_1|\u2026| G_t) be a generator matrix of . Then \u03a8([]) is defined as the equivalence class of [\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q-systems [U], where U=(U_1,\u2026,U_t) is defined as in Theorem <ref>. In this case U is also called a system associated with . Viceversa, given [(U_1,\u2026,U_t)]\u2208\ud835\udd18[\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q, define G_i as the matrix whose columns are an _q-basis of U_i for any i. Then \u03a6([(U_1,\u2026,U_t)]) is the equivalence class of the sum-rank metric code  generated by G=(G_1|\u2026| G_t). In this case  is also called a code associated with U. See <cit.> for the proof that these maps are well-defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Supports\n\n\nWe start by observing that a sum-rank metric code in _q^m^\ud835\udc27 can also be seen as an -subspace in \u2295_i=1^t _q^m_i \u00d7 n_i.\n\nFor every r \u2208{1,\u2026,t}, let \u0393_r=(\u03b3_1^(r),\u2026,\u03b3_m^(r)) be an ordered -basis of _q^m, and let \u0393=(\u0393_1,\u2026,\u0393_t). Given   x=(x_1, \u2026 ,x_t) \u2208_q^m^, with x_i \u2208_q^m^n_i, define the element \n    \u0393(x)=(\u0393_1(x_1), \u2026, \u0393_t(x_t)) \u2208\u03a0,\n where\n\n    x_r,i = \u2211_j=1^m \u0393_r (x_r)_ij\u03b3_j^(r),      i \u2208{1,\u2026,n_r}.\n\nIn other words, the r-th block of \u0393(x) is the matrix expansion of the vector x_r with respect to the -basis \u0393_r of _q^m and this also preserves its rank; cfr. <cit.>.\n\n\nLet x=(x_1,\u2026, x_t)\u2208_q^m^\ud835\udc27 and  \u0393=(\u0393_1,\u2026,\u0393_t) as above.\nThe sum-rank support of x is defined as the space\n\n    _\ud835\udc27(x)=(colsp(\u0393_1(x_1)), \u2026, colsp(\u0393_t(x_t))) \u2286^,\n\nwhere colsp(A) is the -span of the columns of a matrix A.\n\n\nAs proved in <cit.> for the rank-metric case, the support does not depend on the choice of \u0393 and we can talk about the support of a vector without mentioning \u0393. For more details see <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Generalized weights\n\n\nGeneralized rank weights have been introduced several times with different definitions, see e.g. <cit.>, whereas the theory of sum-rank generalized weights is more recent and first introduced in <cit.>.\n\nIn this paper we will deal with the definition given in <cit.> and more precisely to the geometric equivalent, which can be derived as for the rank metric in <cit.>. For more details we refer to <cit.>.\n\n\nLet  be an [\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q sum-rank metric code and let U=(U_1,\u2026,U_t) be an  associated system.\nFor any r \u2208{1,\u2026,k}, the r-th generalized sum-rank weight is\n\n    d_r()=N- max{\u2211_i=1^t _(U_i \u2229 H)   H_q^m_q^m^kr  }.\n\n\n\nIn order to keep track of the metric properties of the code, as done in <cit.>, we can define the generalized sum-rank weight enumerator of a code, which extend the classical weight enumerator of a code (up to the addition of X^N).\n\n\nLet  be an [\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q sum-rank metric code and let U=(U_1,\u2026,U_t) be an associated system.\nFor any r \u2208{1,\u2026,k}, the r-th generalized sum-rank weight enumerator is\n\n    W_^r(X,Y)=\u2211_w=0^N A_w^r X^N-wY^w,\n\nwhere A_w^r is the number of _q^m-subspace of _q^m^k of codimension r such that\n\n    w=N- \u2211_i=1^t _(U_i \u2229 H).\n\n\n\nClearly, the first generalized sum-rank weight enumerator corresponds with the classical weight enumerator.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The associated Hamming-metric codes\n\n\nEvery sum-rank metric code can also be regarded as an Hamming-metric code as shown in <cit.> (see also <cit.> for the rank-metric codes).\n\nFor a collection of multisets (_1,m_1), \u2026, (_t,m_t) of (k-1,q^m). We can define their disjoint union as\n\n    _i=1^t (_i,m_i)=(,m),\n\nwhere =_1\u222a\u2026\u222a_t, and m(P)=m_1(P)+\u2026+m_t(P) for every P\u2208(k-1,q^m).\nFor every n-dimensional _q-subspace U of _q^m^k, it is possible to associate the multiset (L_U,m_U), where  L_U is the _q-linear set defined by U (see next subsection), that is\n\n    L_U={\u27e8 u\u27e9__q^m| u\u2208 U\u2216{ 0}}\u2286(k-1,q^m),\n\nand \n    m_U(\u27e8 v\u27e9__q^m)=q^w_L_U(\u27e8 v\u27e9__q^m)-1/q-1.\n\nThis means that the multiset (L_U,m_U) of (k-1,q^m) has size (counted with multiplicity) q^n-1/q-1. \nWe can now apply this procedure to the elements of an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q system (U_1,\u2026,U_t). In this way we can define the multiset \n\n    (U_1,\u2026,U_t)= _i=1^t (L_U_i,m_U_i).\n\nThen (U_1,\u2026,U_t) is a multiset of points of size q^n_1+\u2026 +q^n_t-t/q-1 in (k-1,q^m).\n\nHence, we can give the following definition.\n\n\nLet  be a linear sum-rank [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q code. Let (U_1,\u2026,U_t) be a system associated with . Any code ^H \u2208\u03a8((U_1,\u2026,U_t)) is called an associated Hamming-metric code to .\n\n\nThe weight distribution of the Hamming-metric code associated with a sum-rank-metric codes can be determined as follows.\nFor x \u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^m^n denote by w_H(x) the Hamming weight of x, that is the number of its non-zero components. \n\n\n Let G=(G_1  | \u2026 |  G_t)\u2208^k\u00d7 N be a generator matrix of an  code, and let v \u2208^k \u2216{0}. \n Denote by G_\u2208^k\u00d7 M to be any generator matrix of a Hamming-metric code ^H in \u03a8((U_1,\u2026,U_t)), where M= q^n_1+\u2026+q^n_t-t/q-1.\n Then\n \n    w_(vG_)= \u2211_i=1^tq^n_i-q^n_i-(vG_i)/q-1.\n\nIn particular, the minimum distance of ^ is given by\n \n    d(^)= min_\ud835\udc2b\u2208S(){\u2211_i=1^tq^n_i-q^n_i-r_i/q-1},\n\n where S() is the set of rank-lists of . \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Linear sets\n\n\nLet V be a k-dimensional vector space over _q^m and consider \u039b=(V,_q^m)=(k-1,q^m).\nLet U be an -subspace of V of dimension n. Then the point-set\n\n    L_U={ u_\ud835\udd3d_q^m :  u\u2208 U\u2216{ 0}}\u2286\u039b\n\nis called an -linear set of rank n.\nAnother important notion is the weight of a point.\nLet P=\u27e8 v\u27e9__q^m be a point in \u039b. The weight of P in L_U is defined as \n\n    w_L_U(P)=_(U\u2229\u27e8 v\u27e9__q^m).\n \nAn upper bound on the number of points that a linear set contains is\n\n    |L_U| \u2264q^n-1/q-1.\n\nFurthermore, L_U is called scattered (and U as well) if it has the maximum number q^n-1/q-1 of points, or equivalently, if all points of L_U have weight one. Blokhuis and Lavrauw provided the following bound on the rank of a scattered liner set.\n\n\nThe rank of a scattered -linear set in (k-1,q^m) is at most mk/2.\n\n\nA scattered -linear set of rank km/2 in (k-1,q^m) is said to be maximum scattered and U is said to be a maximum scattered -subspace as well. \n\nIn the next result we summarize what is known on the existence of maximum scattered linear sets/subspaces.\n\n\nIf mk is even, then there exist maximum scattered subspaces in _q^m^k.\n \n\nWe refer to <cit.> for further details on linear sets and their connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MINIMAL SUM-RANK METRIC CODES AND CUTTING SYSTEMS\n\n\nIn this section we introduce the notion of sum-rank metric minimal codes and we investigate their parameters. The geometry of minimal codes have been important in order to construct and give bounds in both Hamming and rank metric (see <cit.>), via the so called strong blocking sets. These, introduced first in <cit.> in relation to saturating sets, are sets of points in the projective space such that the intersection with every hyperplane spans the hyperplane. In <cit.> strong blocking sets are referred to\nas generator sets and they are constructed as union of disjoint lines. They have gained very recently a renovated interest in coding theory, since <cit.>, in which they are named cutting blocking sets and they are used to construct minimal codes. Quite surprisingly, they have been shown to be the geometric counterparts of minimal codes in <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Definition and first properties\n\n\nIn this subsection we introduce minimal codes in the sum-rank metric and their geometry, together with some structure results.\n\n\nLet  be an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q sum-rank metric code. A codeword c \u2208 is said minimal if for every c'\u2208 such that _\ud835\udc27(c')\u2286_\ud835\udc27(c) then c'=\u03bb c for some \u03bb\u2208_q^m. We say that  is minimal if all of its codewords are minimal. \n\n\n\nAn [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q system (U_1,\u2026,U_t) is called cutting  if for any hyperplane H of \ud835\udd3d_q^m^k  \n\n    \u27e8 U_1\u2229 H,\u2026, U_t\u2229 H\u27e9_\ud835\udd3d_q^m=H,\n\nthat is, if L_U_1\u222a\u2026\u222a L_U_t is a strong blocking set in (k-1,q^m).\n\n\nThe following is a generalization of the geometric characterization of minimal codes in the Hamming and in the rank metric <cit.>.\n\n \nA sum-rank metric code is minimal if and only if an associated system is cutting.\n\n\nThanks to this correspondence, we can easily prove, as in <cit.>, a bound on the maximum weight of a minimal sum-rank metric code.\n\n\nLet  be an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q minimal sum-rank metric code and denote by w() the maximum weight of the codewords in  . Then\n\n    w()\u2264 N-k+1.\n\n\n\nLet (U_1,\u2026,U_t) be a system associated with . Since  is minimal, by Theorem <ref>, for any hyperplane H of \ud835\udd3d_q^m^k we have \n\n    \u27e8 U_1\u2229 H,\u2026, U_t\u2229 H\u27e9_\ud835\udd3d_q^m=H,\n\nwhich implies \n\n    \u2211_i=1^t _\ud835\udd3d_q(U_i\u2229 H)\u2265 k-1.\n\nBy Theorem <ref> the maximum weight of  is\n\n    w()=N-min{\u2211_i=1^t _\ud835\udd3d_q(U_i\u2229 H)  H  is an \ud835\udd3d_q^m-hyperplane of \ud835\udd3d_q^m^k},\n\nand by (<ref>) the assertion follows.\n\n\nWe can provide a characterization of MSRD codes which are minimal.\n\n\nAn MSRD code with parameters [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q is minimal if and only if it is a one-weight code with minimum distance N-k+1.\n\n\nLet  be an MSRD, that is its minimum distance is d=N-k+1. \nBy Theorem <ref>, we also know that w()\u2264 N-k+1, therefore d=w()= N-k+1. \nThe converse trivially holds. \n\n\nWe consider now the Standard Equations, extending <cit.>. Let us recall here that\n\n    N  K_q^m=\u220f_i=0^K-1q^N-q^i/q^K-q^i\n\ndenotes the number of K-dimensional subspaces of _q^m^N and it is called the Gauss binomial coefficient.\n\n\nLet U=(U_1,\u2026,U_t) an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q-system and let\n\n    \u039b_r={ W  W  is an r-dimensional \ud835\udd3d_q^m-subspace of \ud835\udd3d_q^m^k }.\n\nThen \n\n    \u2211_W \u2208\u039b_r, i \u2208{1,\u2026,t} |W \u2229 U_i\u2216{0}| =(q^n_1+\u2026+q^n_t-t)k-1  r-1_q^m.\n\n\n\nThe assertion follows from the fact that for any i \u2208{1,\u2026,t}, <cit.> implies\n\n    \u2211_W \u2208\u039b_r |W \u2229 U_i\u2216{0}| =(q^n_i-1)k-1  r-1_q^m,\n\nand\n\n    \u2211_W \u2208\u039b_r, i \u2208{1,\u2026,t} |W \u2229 U_i\u2216{0}| = \u2211_i \u2208{1,\u2026,t}(\u2211_W \u2208\u039b_r |W \u2229 U_i\u2216{0}| ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Bounds on the parameters of minimal sum-rank metric codes\n\n\nBy extending a minimal sum-rank metric code by adding new columns and/or blocks we get a minimal code as well.\n\n\nLet  be a minimal sum-rank metric code with parameters [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q. Let ' be the code generated by G', where G' is obtained by adding any columns or blocks to any generator matrix G of . Then ' is minimal.\n\n\nThis is an immediate consequence of Theorem <ref>.\n\n\nIn view of Proposition <ref>, it is natural to look for short minimal sum-rank metric codes, when the number of blocks is given. \n\nThe Standard Equations allow to prove the following bound on the parameters of minimal sum-rank metric codes.\n\n\nLet  be an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q minimal sum-rank metric code.\n\nIf t\u2265 k, then\n\n    (q^n_1+\u2026+q^n_t-t)(q^m(k-1)-1)\u2265 (q-1)(k-1)(q^km-1)\n\nIf t\u2264 k-1 then\n\n    (q^n_1+\u2026+q^n_t-t)(q^m(k-1)-1)\u2265 t(q^\u230ak-1/t\u230b-1)(q^km-1).\n\n\n\nBy Theorem <ref>, for any hyperplane\n\n    \u2211_i \u2208{1,\u2026,t}_\ud835\udd3d_q (H\u2229 U_i)\u2265 N-w()\u2265 k-1,\n\ntherefore\n\n    \u2211_i \u2208{1,\u2026,t} |H \u2229 U_i\u2216{0}|\u2265  (q-1)(k-1).\n\nIt follows that \n\n    \u2211_H \u2208\u039b_k-1,  i \u2208{1,\u2026,t} |H \u2229 U_i\u2216{0}| \u2265 (q-1)(k-1)k  1_q^m,\n\nso that, by Lemma <ref>,\n\n    (q^n_1+\u2026+q^n_t-t)k-1  1_q^m\u2265 (q-1)(k-1)k  1_q^m,\n\nwhich is (<ref>).\n\nIf t\u2264 k-1, then (<ref>) implies that \n\n    _(U_i \u2229 H)\u2265\u230ak-1/t\u230b,\n\nfor any i \u2208{1,\u2026,t} and for any hyperplane H. Arguing as before we obtain (<ref>).\n\n\n\nLet  be an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q minimal sum-rank metric code.\n\nIf t\u2265 k, then, for large q,\n\n    N \u2265 t+m+\u2308log_q(k)\u2309,\n\nIf t\u2264 k-1 then, for large q,\n\n    N\u2265\u230ak-1/t\u230b+m+\u2308log_q(t)\u2309+t-1.\n\n\n\n\nNoting that q^N-t+1+(t-1)q\u2265 q^n_1+\u2026+q^n_t the asymptotic bounds follow.\n\n\n\nFor t=N (Hamming-metric case), the bound (<ref>) becomes \n\n    N\u2265\u2308(q^m)^k-1/(q^m)^k-1-1\u00b7 (k-1)\u2309.\n\nThis last is in general slightly weaker than the known lower bound on the length of minimal codes (see <cit.>), recently improved in <cit.> and <cit.> for large k. Note that for k=2, the above bound is sharp.\n\nFor t=1 (rank-metric case), the bound (<ref>) reduces to \n\n    N\u2265 m+k-1,\n which is exactly the bound proved for rank-metric codes <cit.>, which is shown to be sharp for k=2 and for k=3, the last with some additional conditions on m (see <cit.> for the precise statement). \n\nBound (<ref>) is tight for every q, m, t=q+1 and k=2 as we will show in Remark <ref>.\nMoreover, for k=3 and q>2, consider a code  associated with the [\ud835\udc27,3]_q^m/q-system \n\n    U=(U_1,\u2026,U_t),\n\nwhere U_1 is a scattered -subspace of dimension m+2 (which exists under some conditions, see again <cit.>) and U_2,\u2026,U_t any -subspaces of dimension one spanned by random nonzero vectors in _q^m^k.\nBy <cit.> and Theorem <ref>,  is a minimal sum-rank metric code with N=m+2+t-1=m+t+1 which gives the equality in bounds (<ref>) (for t\u2265 3) and (<ref>) (for t=2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Existence of minimal codes\n\n\nA first result immediately follows from <cit.> on the existence of minimal codes in the rank metric.\n\n\nFor any m,k\u2265 2, t and n_2,\u2026,n_t, there exists a minimal code of parameters [(2k+m-2,n_2,\u2026,n_t),k]_q^m/q.\n\n\n<cit.> ensures the existence of a minimal _q^m-linear rank-metric code of length 2k+m-2 of dimension k. Then we can extend such a code to a minimal sum-rank metric code via Proposition <ref>.\n\n\nHowever, the codes described in Proposition <ref> are quite unbalanced, since we look only to the first block and we do not care of the rest. The following result will give a more general existence condition. We  follow the proof of <cit.> to give a condition on the parameters which ensures the existence of a minimal sum-rank metric code. The main difference with the proof of <cit.> consists in computing the size of the analog of the set denoted by \ud835\udcab in <cit.>.\n\n\nIf n_i\u2265 m for any i \u2208{1,\u2026,t} and\n\n    (q^mN-1)(q^m(N-1)-1)/(q^mk-1)(q^m(k-1)-1)-1/2\u2211_i_1,\u2026,i_t=2^m1/q^m-1\u220f_r=1^tm  i_r_q \u220f_j_r=0^i_r-1 (q^n_r-q^j_r) ( q^mi_r-1/q^m-1-1 )\n \nis positive, then there exists a linear sum-rank metric code with parameters [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q which is minimal.\n\n\nDenote by \ud835\udcac a set of nonzero representatives of the one-dimensional _q^m-subspaces of _q^m^k. A non-minimal linear code in \ud835\udd3d_q^m^\ud835\udc27 is any sum-rank metric code containing an element of the following set\n\n    \ud835\udcab={ (x,y) \u2208\ud835\udcac^2  x y, supp^srk(x)\u2286supp^srk(y)  or supp^srk(y)\u2286supp^srk(x) }.\n\nTherefore, the number of minimal sum-rank metric codes in \ud835\udd3d_q^m^\ud835\udc27 is at least\n\n    N  k_q^m- |\ud835\udcab| N-2  k-2_q^m=N-2  k-2_q^m( (q^mN-1)(q^m(N-1)-1)/(q^mk-1)(q^m(k-1)-1) - |\ud835\udcab| ),\n\nand hence if we prove that (q^mN-1)(q^m(N-1)-1)/(q^mk-1)(q^m(k-1)-1) - |\ud835\udcab|>0, then we ensure the existence of a minimal sum-rank metric code.\nFinally we compute the size of \ud835\udcab as follows:\n\n    2 |\ud835\udcab|    =\u2211_i=1^tm |{ (x,y) \u2208\ud835\udcac^2  x y, w(y)=i,  supp^srk(x)\u2286supp^srk(y)  }|\n       = \u2211_i_1,\u2026,i_t=1^m\u2211_y \u2208\ud835\udcac,  w(y)=i_1+\u2026+i_t  |{ x \u2208\ud835\udcac x y, supp^srk(x)\u2286supp^srk(y)  }|\n       = \u2211_i_1,\u2026,i_t=1^m\u2211_y \u2208\ud835\udcac,  w(y)=i_1+\u2026+i_t  |{ x \u2208\ud835\udcac x y, supp^rk(x_\u2113)\u2286supp^rk(y_\u2113)  \u2200\u2113\u2208{1,\u2026,t}}|\n       =\u2211_i_1,\u2026,i_t=2^m1/q^m-1\u220f_r=1^tm  i_r_q \u220f_j_r=0^i_r-1 (q^n_r-q^j_r) ( q^mi_r-1/q^m-1-1 ).\n\n\n\n\nIf n_i\u2265 m for any i \u2208{1,\u2026,t} and\nfor sufficiently large q, if \n    N\u2265 2k+tm-(t+1),\n\nthen there exists a linear sum-rank metric code with parameters [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q which is minimal.\n\n\n\nAs in the proof of <cit.> we have the \n(<ref>) is greater than\n\n    q^2m(N-k)-1/2(q^m-1)^t+1\u2211_i_1,\u2026,i_t=2^m\u220f_r=1^tm  i_r_q q^i_r(m+n_r),\n\nwhich is greater than (with the same arguments as in the proof of <cit.>)\n\n    q^2m(N-k)-f(q)^t/2(q^m-1)^t+1\u00b7\u2211_i_1,\u2026,i_t=2^m\n    q^\u2211_r=1^t 2mi_r-i_r^2+n_ri_r,\n\nwhere \n\n    f(q):=\u220f_i=1^\u221eq^i/q^i-1.\n\nNow, by simple analytic arguments, the largest exponent in the sum on the right is\ntm^2+mN, so that, for q large enough, we get\n\n    q^2m(N-k)-f(q)^t/2\u00b7 q^tm^2+mN-mt-m.\n\nThe thesis again follows by analytic arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE GEOMETRIC DUAL OF SUM-RANK METRIC CODES\n\n\nIn this section we define a new operation which take an element in \u212d[\ud835\udc27,k,d]_q^m/q and it associates to it an element in \u212d[\ud835\udc27',k,d]_q^m/q, where \ud835\udc27=(n_1,\u2026,n_t) and \ud835\udc27'=(mk-n_1,\u2026,mk-n_t). It involves systems and\nwe call it geometric dual. We will show some of its properties and, in the next section, we will show how this object helps in constructing minimal sum-rank metric codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Dual of -subspaces of _q^m-vector spaces\n\n\nLet V be an _q^m-vector space of dimension k and let \u03c3 V \u00d7 V \u2192_q^m be any nondegenerate reflexive sesquilinear form of V and consider \n    [                \u03c3':              V \u00d7 V                  \u27f6                 _q;                                 (x,y)                  \u27fc Tr_q^m/q (\u03c3(x,y)), ]\n \nwhere V is seen as an -vector space of dimension mk.\nSo, \u03c3' is a nondegenerate reflexive sesquilinear form on V seen as an -vector space of dimension km. Then we may consider \u22a5 and \u22a5' as the orthogonal complement maps defined by \u03c3 and \u03c3', respectively. For an _q-subspace U of  V of dimension n, the _q-subspace U^\u22a5' is the dual (with respect to \u03c3') of U, which has dimension km-n; see <cit.>.\n\nAn important property that \u03c3' satisfies is that the dual of an _q^m-subspace W of V is an _q^m-subspace as well and W^\u22a5'=W^\u22a5. Moreover, the following result will be widely used in the paper.\n\n\nLet U be an -subspace of V and W be an _q^m-subspace of V.\nThen \n\n    _(U^\u22a5'\u2229 W^\u22a5)=_(U\u2229 W)+_(V)-_(U)-_(W).\n\n\n\nIn <cit.>, it has been proved that if we replace \u03c3 by another form with the same properties, with this procedure we obtain an -subspace of V which turns out to be \u0393 L(k,q^m)-equivalent to U^\u22a5'.\nFor this reason, from now on we will assume that \u03c3 is fixed and we will just write U^\u22a5', without mentioning the form \u03c3 used.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Geometric dual\n\n\nWe are now ready to give the definition of geometric dual of an _q^m-linear sum-rank metric code, taking into account the dual described in Section <ref>.\n\n\nLet  be an [,k,d]_q^m/q and let U=(U_1,\u2026,U_t) be an associated system to  with the property that U_1\u2229\u2026\u2229 U_t does not contain a 1-dimensional _q^m-subspace.\nThen a geometric dual ^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2 of  (with respect to \u22a5') is defined as ', where ' is any code associated with the system (U_1^\u22a5,\u2026,U_t^\u22a5).\n\n\n\nIn the above definition we need that U_1\u2229\u2026\u2229 U_t does not contain a 1-dimensional _q^m-subspace, otherwise (U_1^\u22a5,\u2026,U_t^\u22a5) would not be a system.\nIndeed, suppose that (U_1^\u22a5,\u2026,U_t^\u22a5) is not a system, then \n\n    \u27e8 U_1^\u22a5',\u2026, U_t^\u22a5'\u27e9__q^m\u2286 H,\n\nwhere H is an _q^m-hyperplane of _q^m^k.

Then U and U' are equivalent systems and hence there exist \u03c1\u2208\ud835\udcae_t, a_1,\u2026,a_t \u2208_q^m^* such that for every i \u2208{1,\u2026,t}\n\n    U_i'=a_i U_\u03c1(i).\n\nNote that this also implies that U_1'\u2229\u2026\u2229 U_t' does not contain any 1-dimensional \ud835\udd3d_q^m-subspace of \ud835\udd3d_q^m^k, since the U_i's satisfy this condition.\nThen for every i \u2208{1,\u2026,t}\n\n    (U_i')^\u22a5'={v \u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^m^k \u03c3'(v,a_i u)=0  \u2200 u \u2208 U_\u03c1(i)}=a_i^-1 U_\u03c1(i)^\u22a5',\n\nsince \u03c3'(v,a_i u)=Tr_q^m/q(a_i\u03c3 (v,u))=\u03c3'(a_iv, u).\n\nThis implies that the systems (U_1^\u22a5',\u2026,U_t^\u22a5') and (U_1'^\u22a5',\u2026,U_t'^\u22a5') are equivalent and hence ^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2 and '^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2 are equivalent as well.\nSo, we proved that \u22a5_\ud835\udca2 is well-defined.\n\nNow, observe that the code ^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2 has dimension k since \u22a5' does not change the dimension of the ambient space of the U_i's. Since _(U_i^\u22a5')=mk-_(U_i) for any i, it follows that ^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2 has parameters [(km-n_1,\u2026,km-n_t),k].\nTo determine the r-th generalized sum-rank weight enumerator of  we need to compute\n\n    N-\u2211_i=1^t_(U_i\u2229 W),\n\nfor any _q^m-subspace W of _q^m^k of dimension r, where N=n_1+\u2026+n_t.\nBy Proposition <ref>, we obtain that\n\n    N-\u2211_i=1^t_(U_i\u2229 W)=N-\u2211_i=1^t_(U_i^\u22a5'\u2229 W^\u22a5)+tmk-N-trm=\n\n\n    tmk-N -\u2211_i=1^t_(U_i^\u22a5'\u2229 W^\u22a5)+N-trm,\n\nwhich correspond to a weight appearing in the (k-r)-th generalized sum-rank weight enumerator of ^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2 plus N-trm.\nTherefore, if \n\n    W_^k-r(X,Y)=\u2211_w=0^N A_w X^N-wY^w       W_^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2^r(X,Y)=\u2211_w=0^N B_w X^tmk-N-wY^w,\n\nwe have that \n\n    A_w=B_w-N+trm,\n\nfor any w.\nTherefore,\n\n    W_^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2^r(X,Y)     =\u2211_w'=0^N B_w'X^tmk-N-w'Y^w'\n       =\u2211_w=0^N B_w-N+trm X^tmk-w-trmY^w-N+trm\n       = \u2211_w=0^N A_w X^tmk-trm-wY^w-N+trm,\n \nthat is the assertion.\n\n\n\nWith the notation of Theorem <ref> and by denoting G a generator matrix of , by Remark <ref> we have that the rank list of the codeword xG is\n\n    (n_1-_(U_1\u2229 x^\u22a5),\u2026,n_1-_(U_t\u2229 x^\u22a5)),\n\nwhich, by Proposition <ref>, is equal to\n\n    (m-_(U_1^\u22a5'\u2229\u27e8 x\u27e9__q^m),\u2026,m-_(U_t^\u22a5'\u2229\u27e8 x\u27e9__q^m)).\n\n\n\n\nThe geometric dual is involutory.\n\n\nThis immediately follows by the definition of geometric dual and from the fact that \u22a5' is involutory.\n\n\n\nThe geometric dual operation can be applied to both Hamming and rank metric. In the first case, the geometric dual of a Hamming-metric code of length n and dimension k will give a sum-rank metric code with parameters [(mk-1,\u2026,mk-1),k]_q^m/q, which is far from being an Hamming-metric code. For rank-metric codes with parameters [n,k]_q^m/q, the geometric dual gives a rank-metric code as well, with parameters [mk-n,k]_q^m/q.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 MINIMAL CODES WITH FEW WEIGHTS\n\n\nIn this section we will mainly deal with explicit construction of minimal codes in the sum-rank metric. We will make extensive use of the geometric dual introduced above.\n\nAs in the Hamming and in the rank metrics (see e.g. <cit.>), all the one-weight sum-rank metric codes are minimal.\n\n \nLet  be an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q sum-rank metric. If all the codewords of  have the same sum-rank metric weight then  is a minimal sum-rank metric code.\n\n\nThe main difference is that in Hamming and rank metrics, simplex codes are essentially the only  one-weight codes; see <cit.>. In the sum-rank metric, we have more examples as we will see later on and as it has been proved in <cit.>.\n\nAnother way to get examples, is to obtain information on minimal codes in sum-rank metric by looking at the associated Hamming-metric codes, cfr. Section <ref>.\n\n\nLet  be an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q sum-rank metric code. Then  is minimal if and only if any associated Hamming-metric code ^H is minimal.\n\n\nThanks to the above proposition, we can use some conditions proved in the Hamming-metric to ensure that a Hamming-metric code is minimal. More precisely, we will now describe a generalization of the celebrated Ashikhmin-Barg condition (see <cit.>).\n\n\nLet  be an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q sum-rank metric code.\nDenote by\n\n    \u03b4_max=max_r \u2208 S(){q^n_i-q^n_i-r_i/q-1}\n\nand \n\n    \u03b4_min=min_r \u2208 S(){q^n_i-q^n_i-r_i/q-1},\n\nwhere S() is the set of rank-lists of .\nIf \n\n    \u03b4_max/\u03b4_min< q^m/q^m-1,\n\nthen the code  is minimal.\n\n\nLet ^H be an associated Hamming-metric code to .\nThe minimum distance of ^H is \u03b4_min and its maximum weight is \u03b4_max.\nBy <cit.> and because of the assumptions on \u03b4_min and \u03b4_max, the code ^H is minimal.\nSince the sum-rank metric code  is minimal if and only if ^H is a minimal code in the Hamming-metric, the assertion is proved.\n\n\nIf a sum-rank metric code satisfies the assumption of Theorem <ref>, we say that it satisfies the AB-condition.\n\n\n\nIn the following subsections, we will first see old and new constructions of one-weight sum-rank metric codes (proving that this is a very large family) and then we will show examples of minimal codes with few weights, where some of them satisfy the AB-condition and some of them do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Sum-rank one-weight codes\n\n\nSome constructions of one-weight codes have been given in <cit.>, which can be divided in three families:\n\n\n    \n  * orbital construction (extending the simplex code);\n    \n  * doubly extended linearized Reed-Solomon;\n    \n  * linear sets construction.\n\n\nIn particular, the last two constructions give 2-dimensional one-weight codes in the sum-rank metric, whereas the first one give constructions of any dimension.\nIn <cit.>, the authors also showed that the last two families cannot be obtained from the orbital construction. It is natural to ask whether or not there are examples of one-weight codes which cannot be obtained from the orbital constructions also for larger dimensions.\n\nWe start by recalling the orbital construction.\n\nLet \ud835\udca2 be a subgroup of (k,q^m) and consider the action \u03d5_\ud835\udca2  of \ud835\udca2 on _q^m^k\u2216{0}, that is\n\n    [           \u03d5_\ud835\udca2 : \ud835\udca2\u00d7 (_q^m^k\u2216{0})               \u27f6      _q^m^k\u2216{0};                           (A,v)               \u27fc             vA. ]\n\nFor any n and r such that r divides m, this action naturally induces an action also on the n-dimensional _q^r-subspaces of _q^m^k with kernel \ud835\udca2\u2229\ud835\udd3b_q^r, where \ud835\udd3b_q^r={\u03b1 I_k \u03b1\u2208_q^r^*}. In order to get a shorter code, we can consider the action of the group \ud835\udca2=\ud835\udca2/(\ud835\udca2\u2229\ud835\udd3b_q^r) on the n-dimensional _q^r-subspaces of _q^m^k, that we denote by \u03d5_\ud835\udca2^r,n. Finally, we say that \ud835\udca2\u2264(k,q^m) is transitive if the action \u03d5_\ud835\udca2^m,1 is transitive;\nsee <cit.> for a more detailed discussion.\n\n[Orbital construction <cit.>]\nLet U be an _q-subspace of _q^m^k of dimension n over _q. Let \ud835\udca2\u2264(k,q^m) be a transitive subgroup and let \ud835\udcaa=(\u03d5_\ud835\udca2^1,n(A,U))_A \u2208\ud835\udca2 be the orbit (counting possible repetition) of the action of \u03d5_\ud835\udca2^1,n. When \ud835\udca2 is the Singer subgroup of GL(k,q^m) we call the orbit \ud835\udcaa an  n-simplex.\nA sum-rank metric code associated with the system \ud835\udcaa=(U_1,\u2026,U_t) is an [(n,\u2026,n),k]_q^m/q one-weight sum-rank metric code. \n\n\n\nLet \ud835\udcaa and \ud835\udcaa' two distinct orbits as in the above construction, the system obtained by plugging together \ud835\udcaa and \ud835\udcaa' gives rise to a one-weight code and the considered system is union of orbits. So, in order to provide a construction of a sum-rank metric code  which is one-weight but does not arise from the orbital construction, we need to show that a system associated with  cannot be obtained as union of orbits.\n\n\nWe now read the property of being one-weight in the geometric dual of the code.\n\n\nLet  be an [\ud835\udc27,k]_q^m/q sum-rank metric code and let (U_1,\u2026,U_t) be an associated system. Assume that U_1\u2229\u2026\u2229 U_t does not contain any 1-dimensional \ud835\udd3d_q^m-subspace of \ud835\udd3d_q^m^k. Then  is a one-weight code if and only if ^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2 is a one-weight code with respect to the generalized weights of order k-1, that is \n\n    d_k-1(^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2)=N- \u2211_i=1^t __q (U_i^\u22a5'\u2229\u27e8 w \u27e9_\ud835\udd3d_q^m),\n\nfor any w \u2208_q^m^k\u2216{0}.\nIn particular, if d_1()  tm then\n\n    \u22c3_i=1^t L_U_i^\u22a5'=(k-1,q^m).\n\n\n\n\nThe code  is one-weight if and only if w_^1(X,Y) only presents one monomial, that is\n\n    w_^1(X,Y)= (||-1) X^N-d_1()Y^d_1().\n\nBy Theorem <ref>, this happens if and only if w_^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2^k-1(X,Y) presents only one monomial, and hence the first part of the assertion. \nFor the last part, observe that if  is one-weight, by the first part of the assertion we have\n\n    \u2211_i=1^t_(U_i^\u22a5'\u2229\u27e8 w\u27e9__q^m)=\u2211_i=1^t w_L_U_i^\u22a5'(\u27e8 w\u27e9__q^m)=tmk-N-d_k-1(^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2),\n\nfor any w \u2208_q^m^k\u2216{0}.\nSuppose that \u22c3_i=1^t L_U_i^\u22a5'(k-1,q^m). Then, because of (<ref>), we can only have that  tmk-N=d_k-1(^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2).\nTheorem <ref> implies also that\n\n    d_1()=d_k-1(^\u22a5_\ud835\udca2)+N-t(k-1)m,\n\nand hence d_1()=tm, a contradiction.\n\n\n\nBy Proposition <ref>, and more precisely from (<ref>), a partition in scattered linear set gives a one-weight code. Indeed, the construction of doubly extended linearized Reed-Solomon code with parameters [(m,\u2026,m,1,1),2]_q^m/q can be read via an associated system (U_1,\u2026,U_q+1) with the following properties:\n\n    \n  * _(U_i)=m for every i\u2208{1,\u2026,q-1};\n    \n  * _(U_q)=_(U_q+1)=1;\n    \n  * U_i's are scattered -subspaces of _q^m^2.\n\nSince in _q^m^2 the hyperplanes coincide with the 1-dimensional _q^m-subspaces of _q^m^2 and since the code is MSRD, we have\n\n    \u2211_i=1^q+1_(U_i\u2229\u27e8 w \u27e9__q^m)=1,\n\nfor any w \u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^m^2\u2216{0}.\nTherefore, these codes are one-weight codes and by Proposition <ref> they are also minimal codes.\nMoreover, they meet the lower bound (<ref>).\nBy Proposition <ref>, the geometric dual of a doubly extended linearized Reed-Solomon code is a one-weight code with parameters \n    [(m,\u2026,m_q-1 times,2m-1,2m-1),2]_q^m/q.\n\nNote that for m=2, such code meets the lower bound (<ref>). We give its generator matrix in the next remark.\n\nIn particular, a partition in scattered subspaces/linear sets gives via Proposition <ref> a\none-weight code with nonzero weight equals to N-t(k-1)m+1. \n\n\n\nWe can determine a generator matrix for the geometric dual of a 2-dimensional doubly extended linearized Reed-Solomon code.\nLet \u03b1_1,\u2026,\u03b1_q-1\u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^m having pairwise distinct norm over  and define\n\n    U_i={(x,a_i x^q)  x \u2208_q^m},\n\nfor any i \u2208{1,\u2026,q-1}.\nConsider the following sesquilinear form\n\n    \u03c3'  ((x,y),(z,t)) \u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^m^2 \u21a6Tr_q^m/q(xt-yz) \u2208.\n\nThen\n\n    U_i^\u22a5'={ (y^q,a_i^q^n-1y)  y \u2208_q^m}={ (y,a_i^q^n-1y^q^n-1)  y \u2208_q^m},\n\nfor any i, since \n\n    \u03c3'((x,a_i x^q),(y^q,a_i^q^n-1y))=Tr_q^m/q(a_i^q^n-1xy-a_ix^q y^q)=0,\n\nfor every x,y \u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^m.\nBy definition of \u03c3' we also have that\n\n    \u27e8 (1,0)\u27e9_^\u22a5'={ (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u03b1,\u03b2\u2208_q^m  and  Tr_q^m/q(\u03b2)=0 }\n\nand \n\n    \u27e8 (0,1)\u27e9_^\u22a5'={ (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u03b1,\u03b2\u2208_q^m  and  Tr_q^m/q(\u03b1)=0 }.\n\nTherefore, if B={b_1,\u2026,b_m} is an -basis of  and C={c_1,\u2026,c_m-1} is an -basis of (Tr_q^m/q), then a generator matrix for the geometric dual of a 2-dimensional linearized Reed-Solomon code is as follows:\n\n    \n  * the i-th blocks has as j-th column (b_j^q,a_i b_j), for i \u2208{1,\u2026,q-1} and j \u2208{1,\u2026,m};\n    \n  * the q-th block has as j-th column (b_j,0) if j \u2208{1,\u2026,m} and (0,c_j-m) if j \u2208{m+1,\u2026,2m-1};\n    \n  * the last block has as j-th column (0,b_j) if j \u2208{1,\u2026,m} and (c_j-m,0) if j \u2208{m+1,\u2026,2m-1}.\n\n\n\nIn the Remark <ref>, we have seen that we can find q-1 maximum scattered -linear set in (1,q^m) which are pairwise disjoint and cover (1,q^m) except for two points (which can be arbitrarily chosen). \n\n\nWe can use this fact to construct partition in scattered -linear sets for higher dimensions. \n\n[partition in scattered linear sets]\nWe start with the plane: consider P=\u27e8 v\u27e9__q^m a point in (2,q^m) and a line \u2113=(W,_q^m) not passing through P.\nDenote by \n\n    \u2113_1=(W_1,_q^m),\u2026,\u2113_q^m+1=(W_q^m+1,_q^m)\n the lines through P and denote by Q_i=\u2113\u2229\u2113_i=\u27e8 v_i\u27e9__q^m for any i \u2208{1,\u2026,q^m+1}.\nFor any i \u2208{1,\u2026,q^m+1} consider\n\n    U_i,1,\u2026,U_i,q-1\n\nmaximum scattered -subspaces of W_i for which the associated linear sets form a partition of \u2113_i\u2216{P,Q_i}, which exists because of Remark <ref>.\nConsider \n\n    U_q^m+2,1,\u2026,U_q^m+2,q-1\n\nmaximum scattered -subspaces of W for which the associated linear sets form a partition of \u2113\u2216{Q_1,Q_2}. \nThe -linear sets associated with U_i,j's together with \u27e8 v \u27e9_,  \u27e8 v_1 \u27e9_ and \u27e8 v_2 \u27e9_ give a partition in scattered -linear sets of (2,q^m).\nThis gives a code of parameters\n\n    [(m,\u2026,m_(q-1)(q^m+2) times,1,1,1),3]_q^m/q\n\nwhose geometric dual has parameters\n\n    [(2m,\u2026,2m_(q-1)(q^m+2) times,3m-1,3m-1,3m-1),3]_q^m/q.\n\n\n\n\nFor larger dimension: suppose that we have U_1,\u2026,U_r scattered -subspaces with the property that the associated linear sets cover a projective space of dimension k-1. \nConsider a point P=\u27e8 v \u27e9__q^m\u2208(k-1,q^m) and a hyperplane H not passing through P, then we can proceed to cover with scattered linear sets all of the lines through P, except for the point P and the intersection of the line with H.

This is a remarkable difference with the rank metric.\n\n\n\nLet  be a code as in Construction <ref> with n_1=\u2026=n_t=n.\nIf \n\n    t>(q-1)\u00b7q^m/q^m-1,\n\nthen  is minimal  and it satisfies the AB-condition.\n\n\nWe will prove the minimality of  with the aid of the AB-condition.\nTo this aim\n\n    \u03b4_max/\u03b4_min= t(q^m-1)/q^m-q+(t-1)(q^m-1)=1+q-1/tq^m-q-t+1,\n\nsince t>(q-1)q^m/(q^m-1) we have \n\n    \u03b4_max/\u03b4_min < q^m/q^m-1\n\nand hence Theorem <ref> implies the assertion.\n\n\n\nConsider Construction <ref> by using more than (q-1)\u00b7q^m/q^m-1 mutually disjoint subgeometries (which exists for instance when (m,k)=1, see Theorem <ref>). The above theorem implies that  Construction <ref> gives minimal codes.\n\n\nNote that in the above result if we consider t=2 and q>2, then the AB-condition is not satisfied (it is indeed satisfied for q=2). In the next result, we show that when t=2, even if the AB-condition is not satisfied, Construction <ref> still gives minimal codes and the two rank-metric codes defined by the two blocks are not minimal.\n\n\nLet U_1 and U_2 be two trivially intersecting scattered _q-subspaces of dimension m contained respectively in W_1 and W_2, where W_1 and W_2 are two distinct 2-dimensional \ud835\udd3d_q^m-subspaces of _q^m^3. The geometric dual (U_1^\u22a5',U_2^\u22a5') of a code associated with (U_1,U_2) is a minimal sum-rank metric code, which satisfies the AB-condition if and only if q=2.\nMoreover, the codes associated with U_1^\u22a5' and U_2^\u22a5', respectively, are not minimal.\n\n\nLet start by computing the possible dimension of intersection between the U_i^\u22a5''s and the _q^m-subspaces of _q^m^3 with dimension either one or two with the aid of Proposition <ref>:\n\n    _\ud835\udd3d_q(U_i^\u22a5'\u2229 W^\u22a5)=_\ud835\udd3d_q(U_i\u2229 W)\u2208{0,1,m},\n\nfor any 2-dimensional \ud835\udd3d_q^m-subspace W and _\ud835\udd3d_q(U_i^\u22a5'\u2229 W^\u22a5)=m if and only if W=W_i, for any i \u2208{1,2}, also\n\n    _\ud835\udd3d_q(U_i^\u22a5'\u2229\u27e8 w\u27e9_\ud835\udd3d_q^m^\u22a5)=_\ud835\udd3d_q(U_i\u2229\u27e8 w\u27e9_\ud835\udd3d_q^m)+m\u2208{m,m+1},\n\nfor any 1-dimensional \ud835\udd3d_q^m-subspace \u27e8 w\u27e9_\ud835\udd3d_q^m. \nIn terms of linear sets, this means that \n\n    w_L_U_i^\u22a5'(P) \u2208{0,1,m}  and   w_L_U_i^\u22a5'(\u2113) \u2208{m,m+1},\n\nfor any point P and any line \u2113 of (2,q^m).\nWe now show that (U_1^\u22a5',U_2^\u22a5') is a cutting system (which is equivalent to show that (U_1^\u22a5',U_2^\u22a5') is minimal by Theorem <ref>), which is equivalent to show that any line \u2113 of (2,q^m) meets L_U_1^\u22a5'\u222a L_U_2^\u22a5' in at least two points.\nNote that since L_U_1^\u22a5' and L_U_2^\u22a5' have rank 2m, which is greater than m+1, then every line meet L_U_1^\u22a5' and L_U_2^\u22a5' in at least one point.\nDenote by P_1 and P_2 the points defined by W_1^\u22a5' and W_2^\u22a5', respectively. \nLet \u2113 be any line through P_1, since P_1 P_2 and P_1 \u2209 L_U_2^\u22a5', then \u2113 meets L_U_2^\u22a5' in at least another point. Therefore, |\u2113\u2229 (L_U_1^\u22a5'\u222a L_U_2^\u22a5')|\u2265 2. Similar arguments can be performed when considering lines through P_2, so assume that \u2113 is a line not passing through neither P_1 nor to P_2. Since all the points different from P_1 and P_2 have weight either one or zero and the weight of \u2113 is either m or m+1, then |\u2113\u2229 L_U_1^\u22a5'|\u2265 2 and hence (U_1^\u22a5',U_2^\u22a5') is a cutting system.\nFinally, we show that U_1^\u22a5' and U_2^\u22a5' are not cutting. Indeed, by contradiction assume that U_1^\u22a5' is a cutting system. Any line \u2113 through P_1 has weight m+1, since w_L_U_1^\u22a5'(P_1)=m and L_U_1^\u22a5'\u2229\u2113 has at least two points. This implies that all the lines through P_1 are contained in L_U_1^\u22a5' and hence\n\n    |L_U_1^\u22a5'| \u2265 (q^m+1)q^m+1,\n\nwhich is a contradiction to the fact that |L_U_1^\u22a5'| \u2264q^2m-1/q-1 by (<ref>). \nNow, let \n\n    \u03b4_max=2(q^(k-1)m-q^(k-2)m)/q-1\n\nand\n\n    \u03b4_min=2q^(k-1)m-q^(k-2)m+1-q^(k-2)m/q-1.\n\nThen \u03b4_max/\u03b4_min<q^m/(q^m-1) if and only if\n\n    --3q^m+2+q^m+1/(-q^m+q-q^m+1)(q^m-1) <0\n\nand hence if and only if\n\n    -3q^m+2+q^m+1<0,\n\nand, since it can be rewritten as q^m(q-3)<-2, this happens if and only if q=2. Therefore, the assumption of Theorem <ref> are satisfied if and only if q=2.\n\n\n\nLet \n\n    U_1={(x,x^q,0)  x \u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^m}  and   U_2={(0,x,x^q)  x \u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^m}.\n\nIt is easy to see that they satisfy the assumptions of Theorem <ref>.\nConsider \u03c3' as the following sesquilinear form\n\n    \u03c3'  ((x,y,t),(x',y',z')) \u2208\ud835\udd3d_q^m^3 \u21a6Tr_q^m/q(xx'+yy'+zz') \u2208_q.\n\nThen\n\n    U_1^\u22a5'= { (x^q^m-1,-x,y)  x,y \u2208_q^m}\n\nand \n\n    U_2^\u22a5'= { (y,x^q^m-1,-x)  x,y \u2208_q^m}.\n\nTherefore, a generator matrix of \ud835\udc9e(U_1^\u22a5',U_2^\u22a5') is\n\n    G=( \n    [ a_1^q^m-1         \u2026 a_m^q^m-1         0         \u2026         0       a_1         \u2026       a_m         0         \u2026         0;      -a_1         \u2026      -a_m         0         \u2026         0         0         \u2026         0 a_1^q^m-1         \u2026 a_m^q^m-1;         0         \u2026         0       a_1         \u2026       a_m         0         \u2026         0      -a_1         \u2026      -a_m ])\u2208_q^m^3\u00d7 4m,\n\nwhere {a_1,\u2026,a_m} is an -basis of _q^m.\n\n\n\nIn the above example, we may replace x^q with any scattered polynomial; see <cit.> and the references therein.\n\n\nIn the next result we show that when t=2 in Construction <ref> with n_1 and n_2 having a distinct value, then the code obtained satisfies the AB-condition if n_1 and n_2 are enough close distinct numbers.\n\n\nLet U_1 and U_2 be two trivially intersecting scattered _q-subspaces of dimension n_1 and n_2=n_1-r with 1\u2264 r \u2264 m, respectively.
