The question regained a lot of interest in the last decades. The celebrated theorem by Alexander and Hirschowitz in 1995 established the general Waring rank in any number of variables and degrees <cit.>. The attention to Waring decompositions has been motivated also by its connection to tensor decompositions; in this case, symmetric tensors. Indeed, tensor decompositions find a lot of uses in several applications, see for example <cit.>. The computation of most tensor decompositions is known to be an NP-hard problem and the same is conjectured fo symmetric tensors <cit.>. Therefore, a theoretical study of related algebraic and geometric structures can be useful to shed lights on them. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Apolar sets of points\n\nWaring decompositions have a geometric interpretation in terms of Veronese varieties. Consider the Veronese embedding given\u00a0by \n\n    \u03bd_d :  S_1 \u27f6 S_d,      [\u2113] \u21a6 [\u2113^d].\n\n\n  Given f \u2208 S_d and a set of points A \u2282 S_1, we say that A is apolar to f if [f] \u2208\u27e8\u03bd_d(A) \u27e9. If there is no subset A' \u2282 A such that [f] \u2208\u27e8\u03bd_d(A') \u27e9 we say that A is non-redundant. If the cardinality of A equals the Waring rank of f we say that A computes (the rank of) f.\n\nAny Waring decomposition of a polynomial f \u2208 S_d has a geometric counterpart given by a set of points A \u2282 S_1 apolar to f, i.e., the equation (<ref>) is equivalent to say that [f] \u2208\u27e8\u03bd_d(A) \u27e9 for A = {[\u2113_1],\u2026,[\u2113_r]}\u2282 S_1. This geometric interpretation allows us to define a notion of rank with respect to any algebraic variety X \u2282^N. I.e., the rank of any p \u2208^N with respect to X is the minimal cardinality of a set of points A \u2282 X such that p \u2208\u27e8 A \u27e9. \n\nA more algebraic way to relate Waring decompositions with sets of points is through apolarity theory. By Macaulay <cit.> (see also <cit.>), there is a one-to-one correspondence between artinian Gorenstein graded algebras with socle degree d and homogeneous polynomials of degree d. Let R = \u2295_d\u2208 R_d = [y_0,\u2026,y_n] be a second polynomial ring and consider the apolar action of R over S by partial derivatives, i.e., for any g \u2208 R_e, f \u2208 S_d, we define g \u2218 f := g(\u2202_0,\u2026,\u2202_n)f \u2208 S_d-e. Given f \u2208 S_d, the apolar ideal of f is the annihilator of f with respect to the apolar action, i.e.,\n\n    (f) := {g \u2208 R \u00a0:\u00a0 g \u2218 f = 0}\u2282 R.\n\nMacaulay's duality affirms that an artinian algebra A = R/J is Gorenstein of socle degree d if and only if J = (f) for some f \u2208 R_d. The Apolarity Lemma, see <cit.>, affirms that Waring decompositions of a polynomial f \u2208 S_d correspond to sets of points A \u2282 S_1 such that I(A) \u2282(f), i.e., the equation (<ref>) is equivalent to say that I(A) \u2282(f) for A = {[\u2113_1],\u2026,[\u2113_r]}\u2282 S_1. In other words, the study of Waring decompositions is equivalent to study ideals of sets of points in S_1, i.e., radical homogeneous ideals of height one, contained in artinian Gorenstein ideals. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Hilbert function of apolar sets of points\n \nMost of algebraic invariants of algebraic varieties are encoded by the Hilbert function. Given a homogeneous ideal I \u2282 R, let I_d = I \u2229 R_d be its degree-d homogeneous part. The Hilbert function of R/I is the numerical function _R/I : \u2192 with \n\n    _R/I(d) := _[R_d/I_d] = _ R_d - _ I_d\n\nIf A \u2282 S_1 is a set of points, then we write _A for the Hilbert function of R/I(A) where I(A) is the defining homogeneous ideal of A. \n\n\n\n\nThe study of Hilbert functions of reduced sets of points has been successfully used to compute Waring ranks. For example, the Hilbert function of the apolar ideal of a given polynomial provides a lower bound for the Waring rank of the polynomial. In some cases, these were shown to be optimal, see e.g. <cit.>.\n\nIf a polynomial admits a unique minimal Waring decomposition, then we say that the polynomial is identifiable. It is worth to mention that the general homogeneous polynomial with rank r strictly smaller than the general one is identifiable except for the special cases (n,d,r) \u2208{(2,6,9),(3,4,8),(5,3,9)}, see <cit.>. In <cit.>, Cayley-Bacharach properties and liaison theory of sets of points in the projective plane were exploited to provide a criterion to certify that a form is identifiable. On the other hand, when the polynomial is not identifiable, it is interesting to study the family of apolar sets of points computing the rank of the polynomial, see <cit.>. In <cit.>, a classification of low rank polynomials is given in terms of the possible Hilbert functions of apolar sets of points computing the rank of the polynomials.\n\nIt is well-known that the Hilbert function of a set of points is strictly increasing until it reaches its cardinality. We call regularity of A the smallest integer i for which the Hilbert function of A stabilizes, i.e., such that _A(i) = _A(i+1).\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The question.\n\nIn this short note, we address the following question. \n[<cit.>]\n  Let f \u2208 S_d. Do all sets of points computing the rank of f share the same regularity? More generally, do they share the same Hilbert function?\n\nThe answer is known to be positive for binary forms (n = 2), because all sets of points with same cardinality on the projective line share the same Hilbert function, and for monomials x_0^d_0\u22ef x_n^d_n because all sets of points computing the rank are known to be complete intersections with generators of degrees d_1+1,\u2026,d_n+1 if d_0 \u2264 d_i for all i, see <cit.>. In the present note, we prove that the answer to Question\u00a0<ref> is negative for ternary forms (n=3) if the degree is sufficiently large. We provide two cases. In Section <ref>, we consider degree-10 ternary forms having rank 22, that is the general rank. Among them, we consider the special ones which admit a unique quintic in the apolar ideal. We show in Theorem <ref> that the general such form has a decomposition lying on the quintic and one not contained in the quintic. Along with this proof, we notice that there exist degree-10 ternary forms of rank 22 and with a unique quintic in the apolar ideal which have higher rank with respect to such quintic curve, see Remark <ref>. We recall that the study of the connection between catalecticant matrices and the Hilbert function of certain decompositions was also used in <cit.> where a complete stratification of ternary sextics of rank nine. In Section <ref>, we consider degree-13 ternary forms having rank 30, that is strictly subgeneric. In Theorem <ref>, we show that there exist two sets of 30 points which compute the rank of a degree-13 ternary form and have different regularity. Our proofs follow the ideas of <cit.>, by exploiting properties of Hilbert functions of points in the projective plane and, in particular, liaison theory. In Section <ref>, we show an explicit construction with the support of the algebra software Macaulay2 <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ALGEBRAIC PROPERTIES OF POINTS IN ^N\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Hilbert function of points in ^n\n\nLet A \u2282^n be a set of points of cardinality \u2113(A). We recalled in (<ref>) the definition of the Hilbert function of A. The first difference is the numerical function given by\n\n    Dh_A : \u2192,    D_A(i) := _A(i)-_A(i-1).\n\nWe recall some elementary properties of Hilbert functions of points in ^n that will be used later. We refer to <cit.> for an extensive exposition including proofs.\n<cit.>\n   Let A \u2282^n be a set of points of cardinality \u2113(A).\n  \n    \n  * h_A(j) \u2264\u2113(A), for all j;\n    \n  * Dh_A(j) = 0, for j < 0;\n    \n  * h_A(0) = Dh_A(0) = 1;\n    \n  * Dh_A(j) \u2265 0, for all j;\n    \n  * h_A(i) = \u2211_j=0^i Dh_A(j); \n    \n  * h_A(j) = \u2113(A), for all j \u226b 0; \n    \n  * Dh_A(j) = 0, for j \u226b 0;\n    \n  * \u2211_j=0^\u221e Dh_A(j) = \u2113(A);\n    \n  * for any A' \u2282 A, h_A'(j) \u2264 h_A(j) and Dh_A'(j) \u2264 Dh_A(j) for any j;\n    \n  * if Dh_A(j) < j, then Dh_A(j) \u2265 Dh_A(j+1).\n    \n\nFinally, we denote\n\n    h^1_A(d) := \u2113(A) - _A(d) = \u2211_i=d+1^\u221e Dh_A(i).\n \nThe following proposition allows us to understand if, given two sets of points, there exists a homogeneous polynomial of given degree to which they are both apolar.\n<cit.>\n  Let A,B \u2282^n be finite sets of points and let Z = A \u222a B. Then, for any d \u2208,\n  \n    (\u27e8\u03bd_d(A) \u27e9\u2229\u27e8\u03bd_d(B) \u27e9) = \u2113(A \u2229 B) - 1 + h^1_Z(d).\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Liaison for points in ^2\n\nWe describe here some construction that will be used in Section <ref> to construct the examples replying to Question <ref>. These are basic constructions from liaison theory; we refer to <cit.> for a complete presentation of the theory. \n\n  Let A,B \u2282^2 be two sets of points. We say that A and B are linked if there exists a complete intersection Z such that I_B = I_Z : I_A. When A \u2229 B = \u2205, this is equivalent to say that Z = A \u222a B. We say that B is the residue of A with respect to Z. \n\nA set of points in ^2 is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay of codimension 2, hence a minimal free resolution is provided by the Hilbert-Burch Theorem, see <cit.>. If A and B are linked, then a Hilbert-Burch matrix of B can be recovered from one of A by the mapping cone construction, see <cit.>.\n\nLet S(i) be the polynomial ring with the gradation shifted by i, i.e., S(d)_i := S_d+i. A similar notation is used for every graded S-module. If A and B are linked through a complete intersection Z of type (d_1,d_2), then we have the following free resolutions\n\n    [                 0                 \u2192       S(-d_1-d_2)                 \u2192 S(-d_1) \u2295 S(-d_2)                 \u2192               I_Z                 \u2192                 0;                                                     \u2193                                  \u2193\u03d5                                   \u2193;                 0                 \u27f6               F_1                                 F_0                 \u27f6               I_A                 \u27f6                 0;                   ]\n\nwhere \u03d5 : S(-d_1) \u2295 S(-d_2) \u2192 F_0 is the map induced by the right-most vertical arrow which corresponds to the inclusion I_Z \u2282 I_A and M is a Hilbert-Burch matrix of A. Then, by the mapping cone construction, a resolution of I_B is given by\n\n    [                                                           0                                                           \u2192                                             F_0(-d_1-d_2)^\u2228                                                             [ S(-d_1) \u2295 S(-d_2);                 \u2295;   F_1(-d_1-d_2)^\u2228 ]                                                           \u2192                                                         I_B                                                           \u2192                                                          0. ]\n\nThe Hilbert functions between the two linked sets of points are linked by the following formula on their first differences:\n\n    Dh_B(i) + Dh_A(d_1+d_2-i-2) = Dh_Z(i),\n\nsee <cit.> or <cit.>.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Cayley-Bacharach properties\n\nWe recall here also some basic fact about Cayley-Bacharach properties for sets of points in projective space. They are used to understand the possible Hilbert functions of sets of points A \u222a B where A and B are apolar to the same homogeneous form. These properties have been crucial to provide certificates for identifiability of forms in <cit.>.\n\n\n  Let Z \u2282^n be a set of points. We say that it satisfies the Cayley-Bacharach property in degree d (CB(d)) if, for all p \u2208 Z, it holds that every form of degree d vanishing at Z \u2216{p} also vanishes at p.\n\n\n<cit.>\n  Let f \u2208 S_d and let A be a non-redundant set of points apolar to f. Let B a second non-redundant set of points apolar to f such that A \u2229 B = \u2205. Then, the set Z = A \u222a B satisfies CB(d). \n\n\n<cit.>\n  Let Z \u2282^n be a set of points satisfying CB(d). Then, for any i \u2208{0,\u2026,d+1},\n  \n    \u2211_j=0^i Dh_Z(j) \u2264\u2211_j=0^i Dh_Z(d+1-j).\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Secant varieties and Terraccini loci\n\nThe geometric framework to deal with Waring decompositions is the one of secant varieties of Veronese varieties, see <cit.>. Given an irreducible algebraic variety X \u2282^N, the r-th secant variety is an irreducible variety defined as the Zariski closure of the union of linear spaces spanned by r-tuples of points on X, i.e.,\n\n    \u03c3_r(X) := \u22c3_p_1,\u2026,p_r \u2208 X\u27e8 p_1,\u2026,p_r \u27e9\u2282^N.\n\nIf X is the d-th Veronese embedding of S_1, then, by Definition <ref>,\n\n    \u03c3_r(\u03bd_d(^n)) = {[f] \u2208 S_d \u00a0:\u00a0(f) \u2264 r}\u2282 S_d.\n\nSecant varieties are clearly nested into each other by definition, but, if the variety X is non-degenerate, then we have that its secant varieties eventually fill the ambient space, see <cit.>. For example, the minimal r such that \u03c3_r(\u03bd_d(^n)) =  S_d is the Waring rank of the general degree-d form in n+1 variables. \n\nUnderstanding which secant variety fills the ambient space reduces to the computation of dimensions of secant varieties. By a simple parameter count, the expected dimension of the r-th secant variety of an algebraic variety X \u2282^N is\n\n    exp.\u03c3_r(X) := min{r(X) + r - 1, N}.\n\nThe expected dimension is always an upper bound for the actual dimension and if \u03c3_r(X) <  exp.\u03c3_r(X) then we say that X is r-defective. The classification of defective varieties is a very classical problem with roots in the late XIX century. By Palatini <cit.>, if \u03c3_r(X) is not an hypersurface and does not fill the ambient space, then it is at least of codimension 2 inside \u03c3_r+1(X). As an immediate corollary, projective curves are never defectives. A classification of defective surfaces is due to Severi and Terracini, see <cit.>, while the classification of defective threefolds is due to Scorza <cit.>. The case of fourfolds has been treated first by Scorza in <cit.> (see also <cit.>) and then completed in the recent preprint <cit.>.\n\nIf we denote by X^(r) the r-th symmetric product of the variety X, the r-th abstract secant variety of X is \n\n    ab\u03c3_r(X) := {((p_1,\u2026,p_r),q) \u00a0:\u00a0 q \u2208\u27e8 p_1,\u2026,p_r \u27e9}\u2282 X^(r)\u00d7^N.\n\nThroughout the paper, we always denote by \u03c0_i the projection onto the i-th factor from a cartesian product. The r-th abstract secant variety is irreducible of dimension r(X)+r-1. Hence, if \u03c3_r(X) \u228a^N, non-defectiveness is equivalent to say that the projection \u03c0_2 : ab\u03c3_r(X) \u2192^N has generically finite fibers. The r-th Terracini locus of X is\n\n    \ud835\udd4b_r(X) := {(p_1,\u2026,p_r) \u00a0:\u00a0p_i \u2208 X^ smooth, {p_1,\u2026,p_r} are linearly independent, \n     T_p_1(X),\u2026,T_p_r(X)  are linearly dependent}\u2282 X^(r).\n\nThe main tool to study dimensions of secant varieties is the Terracini's Lemma which describes the general tangent space to secant varieties, see <cit.>. In particular, it claims that, given general points p_1,\u2026,p_r \u2208 X and a general point p \u2208\u27e8 p_1,\u2026,p_r \u27e9, then\n\n    T_p\u03c3_r(X) = \u27e8 T_p_1(X),\u2026,T_p_r(X) \u27e9.\n\nIf X is not r-defective and \u03c3_r(X) does not fill the space, then \ud835\udd4b_r(X) is a proper subvariety of X^(r). In other words, the preimage of the Terracini's locus \u03c0_1^-1(\ud835\udd4b_r(X)) is contained in the locus where the differential of the projection \u03c0_2 : ab\u03c3_r(X) \u2192^N drops rank. \n\nThe complete classification of defective Veronese varieties is known as the Alexander-Hirschowitz Theorem <cit.>. In the 1980s, Alexander and Hirschowitz defined a very powerful machinery to deal with problems on polynomial interpolation such as the computation of the dimension of the linear system of degree-d hypersurfaces of ^n having r singularities at general points. The latter problem is equivalent to compute dimensions of secant varieties of the Veronese varieties and, a posteriori, to compute the general Waring rank in S_d.\n\n  The r-th secant variety of the Veronese variety \u03bd_d(^n) is non-defective except for \n  \n    \n  * d = 2, n \u2265 2 and 2 \u2264 r \u2264 n;\n    \n  * d = 3, n = 4, r = 7;\n    \n  * d = 4, (n,r) \u2208{(2,5), (3,9), (4,14)}.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE EXAMPLES\n\nIn this section, we give a negative answer to Question <ref> by showing that there exist ternary forms admitting apolar sets of points computing their Waring rank with different Hilbert function as well as different regularity.\n\nThe idea is to start from a special set of points Z_1 and, by means of liaison theory, to construct a second set of points of the same cardinality Z_2, but different Hilbert function, such that \u27e8\u03bd_d(Z_1) \u27e9\u2229\u27e8\u03bd_d(Z_2) \u27e9 is non-empty, i.e., there is a degree-d form f whose Z_1 and Z_2 are both apolar to. After the construction, we prove that indeed Z_1 and Z_2 compute the rank of f. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 First example. Degree-10 ternary forms of rank 22.\n\n\n  There exists a form f \u2208 S_10 of rank 22 having two sets of points computing its rank and presenting different Hilbert functions. \n\n\n  Let Z_1 \u2282^2 be a set of 22 general points on a quintic curve. Then,\n  \n    h_Z_1 :     1     3     6     10     15     20     22     22    \u22ef\n    \n          D h_Z_1 :     1     2     3     4     5     5     2     -\n\n  Let L \u2282^2 be a general line and let Y be a set of five general points on L. Consider A = Z_1 \u222a Y. Clearly there are no quintics through A since there is a unique quintic through Z_1 and the line L is chosen generically. Moreover, Y imposes independent conditions on the space of sextics through Z_1: indeed, it is enough to observe that I(Z_1)_6 -  I(Z_1)_5 = 5 \u2265#Y, see e.g. <cit.>.

I.e., there exists f \u2208 S_10 such that [f] \u2208\u27e8\u03bd_10(Z_1) \u27e9\u2229\u27e8\u03bd_10(Z_2) \u27e9.\n  \n  Now, we need to show that the general degree-10 form f constructed as in Claim\u00a0<ref> is indeed of rank 22. Let \ud835\udcb3 be the variety of degree-10 forms admitting an apolar set of 22 reduced points lying on a quintic. \n  \n    The variety \ud835\udcb3 is irreducible and has codimension 2. \n  \n  \n    Note that the variety of degree-10 ternary forms f\u2208 S_10 admitting a quintic in the apolar ideal is a hypersurface defined by the vanishing of the determinant of the central catalecticant matrix associated to the map \n    \n    cat_5(f) : R_5 \u2192 S_5, g \u21a6 g \u2218 f.\n\n    The fact that the variety {( cat_5(f)) = 0} is irreducible follows from <cit.>. Fixed a plane quintic C \u2282^2, by Riemann-Roch Theorem, we have that \u27e8\u03bd_10(C) \u27e9 = ^44. Since curves are non-defective, \u03c3_22\u03bd_10(C) = 43, see Section <ref>. Therefore the general form f \u2208\u27e8\u03bd_10(C) \u27e9 has rank 23 with respect to \u03bd_10(X) and \ud835\udcb3 has codimension one in the hypersurface of forms admitting a quintic in the apolar ideal. In other words, if we consider the incidence variety of forms lying on the 22-nd secant variety of the degree-10 Veronese embedding of a plane quintic \n    \u2110 = {(C,[f]) \u00a0:\u00a0 [f] \u2208\u03c3_22(\u03bd_10(C))}\u2282 S_5 \u00d7 S_10,\n then \ud835\udcb3 = \u03c0_2(\u2110). The projection \u03c0_2 is generically one-to-one because the quintic in the apolar ideal for a general form [f] \u2208\ud835\udcb3 is uniquely the determinant of cat_5(f). Given a quintic C, we have that \u03c0_1^-1(C) \u2245\u03c3_22(\u03bd_10(C)). Hence, \ud835\udcb3 = \u2110 =  S_5 + \u03c3_22(\u03bd_10(C)) = 20 + 43 = 63 inside S_10 = ^65. \n  \n\n  \n    The general form [f] \u2208\ud835\udcb3 has rank 22.\n  \n  \n    By Alexander-Hirschowitz Theorem (Theorem <ref>), \n    \n    \u03c3_21(\u03bd_10(^2)) = 21 \u00b7 2 + 20 = 62,\n \n    i.e., \u03c3_21(\u03bd_10(^2)) has codimension 3. Hence, by Claim <ref>, \ud835\udcb3\u2229\u03c3_21(\u03bd_10(^2)) is a proper subvariety of\u00a0\ud835\udcb3.\n  \n  \n  Consider \ud835\udcb4\u2282\ud835\udcb3 the set of degree-10 forms that are constructed as in Claim\u00a0<ref>. Let Hilb^\u2218_22(^2) be the open subset of the Hilbert scheme of 22 points in ^2 and let Hilb^\u2218_22,5(^2) denote the set of all sets of 22 general points lying on a quintic of ^2. Then, consider the incidence variety\n    \n    \ud835\udca5 = {(Z_1,Z_2,[f]) \u00a0:\u00a0\u27e8\u03bd_10(Z_1) \u27e9\u2229\u27e8\u03bd_10(Z_2) \u27e9 = [f]}\u2282 Hilb^\u2218_22,5(^2) \u00d7 Hilb^\u2218_22(^2) \u00d7 S_10.\n\n  By construction, \ud835\udcb4 = \u03c0_3(\ud835\udca5). Moreover, from the construction described at the beginning of the proof, the projection \u03c0_1 is dominant, i.e., for a general choice of a set Z_1 of 22 points on a quintic in ^2, there exists Z_2 \u2208 Hilb^\u2218_22(^2) and f \u2208 S_10 such that (Z_1,Z_2,[f]) \u2208\ud835\udca5. With a similar construction, we can also show that the projection \u03c0_2 is dominant. \n  \n    The projection \u03c0_2 : \ud835\udca5\u2192 Hilb^\u2218_22(^2) is dominant.\n  \n  \n    Let Z_2 be a general set of 22 points in \u2119^2. Take a set Y of three general points collinear on a general line L and let A = Z_2 \u222a Y. Since there are no quintics through Z_2, then the three points impose independent conditions on sextics through Z_2, see <cit.>. Hence, \n    \n    h_A :     1     3     6     10     15     21     25     25    \u22ef\n    \n            D h_A :     1     2     3     4     5     6     4     -\n \n    Let {G_1,G_2,G_3} be a basis for the space of sextics passing through A, i.e., [I_A]_6 = \u27e8 G_1,G_2,G_3 \u27e9. The restriction of [I_A]_6 on L defines a non-complete linear series g^2_3 away from the set of points Y. \n    The linear series on L is generically base-point free, then it defines a regular map on ^2 which maps L into a singular cubic curve C. Indeed, since being base-point free is an open condition, this can be checked directly on a specific example with the support of the algebra software Macaulay2\u00a0<cit.>, see Section <ref>. For example, without loss of genericity, let L = {x_0 = 0} and Y = {(0:1:0), (0:0:1), (0:1:1)}. Hence, for i = 1,2,3, the restriction of G_i on L is given by G_i(0,x_1,x_2) = x_1x_2(x_1-x_2)H_i(x_1,x_2) and we consider the map \u03c6 : L \u2192^2, p \u21a6 (H_1(p):H_2(p):H_3(p)). Let C = \u03c6(L). The general cubic C constructed as above is nodal. Indeed, since being nodal is an open condition on the space of rational plane cubics, it is enough to exhibit one example in which the above construction provides a nodal curve. This is checked with the support of the algebra software Macaulay2 <cit.>, see Section <ref>. \n    \n    Now, let X be the set of two distinct points on L which are pre-images of the singular point of C and consider the set of five points X \u222a Y \u2282 L. By construction, X \u222a Y does not impose independent conditions on the space of sextics passing through A.

In particular, the general [f] \u2208\ud835\udcb4 has rank 22.\n  \n  \n    Since the 22-nd secant variety of \u03bd_10(^2) and of \u03bd_10(C), for any quintic C \u2282^2, are non-defective, we have that the Terracini loci in Hilb^\u2218_22,5(^2) and Hilb^\u2218_22(^2) are proper sub-varieties. In particular, we can restrict the projection \u03c0_3 to the dense subspace of \ud835\udca5 given by the triplets (Z_1,Z_2,[f]) such that Z_1 and Z_2 do not belong to the corresponding Terracini locus. This implies that, for the general [f] \u2208\ud835\udcb4, the fiber \u03c0_3^-1([f]) is finite, see <cit.>. In particular, \ud835\udcb4 = \ud835\udca5. \n    \n    Since \u03c0_2 is dominant, for a general Z_2 \u2208 Hilb^\u2218_22(^2), we have that \ud835\udca5 =  Hilb^\u2218_22(^2) + \u03c0_2^-1(Z_2). Now, Hilb^\u2218_22(^2) = 44. Following the construction in Claim <ref>, we see that \u03c0_2^-1(Z_2) = 19. Indeed, it depends on the choice of three collinear points, that is five parameters (2 to fix a line and 3 to fix three points on it), and the choice of the general complete intersection of two septics, that is the choice of a pencil in the 8-dimensional projective space of septics through the set of 27 points A, i.e., other 14 = 2(9-2) parameters. In particular, \ud835\udca5 = 63 = \ud835\udcb3. Since \ud835\udcb3 is irreducible, we conclude the first part of the statement. The second part of the statement follows directly from Claim <ref>.\n  \n  Therefore, the general element of \ud835\udcb4 evinces the statement of the theorem.\n\n\n  In the proof of Claim <ref> we observed that, given a general quintic curve C \u2282^2, the general degree-10 form in \u27e8\u03bd_10(C) \u27e9 = ^44 has rank 23 with respect to the curve. However, since the general rank of degree-10 ternary forms is equal to 22 by Alexander-Hirschowitz Theorem (Theorem <ref>), we also deduce that the general form in \u27e8\u03bd_10(C) \u27e9 has rank 22 with respect to the Veronese variety \u03bd_10(^2). In other words, there exist degree-10 ternary forms whose apolar ideal has minimal generators in degree five but minimal Waring decompositions are given by sets of points whose ideal does not involve such minimal generators. \n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Second example.

I.e., by (<ref>),\n\n    [   Dh_X :        1        2        3        4        5        6        6        5        4        3        2        1        -; Dh_Z_1 :        1        2        3        4        5        6        6        2        1        - ]\n\nWe link Z_1 to another set Z_2 of 30 points through a complete intersection Y = Z_1 \u222a Z_2 of 60 points defined by a sextic and degree-10 form. I.e., by (<ref>),\n\n    [   Dh_Y :        1        2        3        4        5        6        6        6        6        6        5        4        3        2        1        -; Dh_Z_1 :        1        2        3        4        5        6        6        2        1        -; Dh_Z_2 :        1        2        3        4        5        6        5        4        - ]\n\nWe immediately observe that Z_1 and Z_2 are both apolar to a form of degree 13. Indeed, from the first difference of Y = Z_1 \u222a Z_2 in (<ref>), we have h^1_14(Z_1 \u222a Z_2) = 1. By Proposition <ref>, \u27e8\u03bd_13(Z_1) \u27e9\u2229\u27e8\u03bd_13(Z_2) \u27e9 = [f] for some degree 13 form f. \n\n  f has rank 30.\n\n\n  Let Z_1 be as above and Z' \u2282^n be another set of points apolar to\u00a0f. \n  \n  First, assume that Z_1 \u2229 Z' = \u2205 and let Z = Z_1 \u222a Z'. By Lemma\u00a0<ref>-(9) since \u2211_i=0^5 Dh_Z_1(i) = 21 then also \u2211_i=0^5 Dh_Z(i) = 21. By Proposition <ref>, Z satisfies CB(13) and then, by Theorem <ref>,\n  \n    21 = \u2211_i=0^5 Dh_Z(i) \u2264\u2211_i = 9^14 Dh_Z(i).\n\n  In particular, we deduce that Dh_Z(5) = Dh_Z(9) = 6 and, by Lemma <ref>(10), we have Dh_Z(i) \u2265 6 for i \u2208{6,7,8}. I.e.,\n  \n    [                                   0           1           2           3           4           5           6           7           8           9          10          11          12          13          14            ;     Dh_Z(i)           :           1           2           3           4           5           6         \u2265 6         \u2265 6         \u2265 6           6           5           4           3           2           1;   Dh_Z_1(i)           :           1           2           3           4           5           6           6           2           1           -; Dh_Z'(14-i)           :                                                                                   ?           ?           ?           6           5           4           3           2           1             ]\n\n  Since Dh_Z_1(7) + Dh_Z_1(8) = 3, we conclude that Dh_Z(7) + Dh_Z(8) \u2265 9. Hence,\n  \n    \u2113(Z') \u2265\u2211_i=7^14 Dh_Z'(i) \u2265 9 + 21 = 30.\n\n  Assume now that Z_1 \u2229 Z' \u2260\u2205. As observed in <cit.>, if Z\u201d = Z' \u2216 (Z' \u2229 Z_1), then there exists a form f_0 \u2208 S_13 such that [f] \u2208\u27e8\u03bd_13(Z_1) \u27e9\u2229\u27e8\u03bd_13(Z\u201d) \u27e9. Indeed, if Z_1 = {\u2113_1,\u2026,\u2113_30} and Z' = {\u2113_1,\u2026,\u2113_k,m_k+1,\u2026,m_r}, then,\n  \n    f = \u2211_i=1^30a_i\u2113_i^13 = \u2211_i=1^kb_i\u2113_i^13 + \u2211_i=k+1^rb_i m_i^13\n\n  and\n  \n    f_0 = \u2211_i=1^k(a_i-b_i)\u2113_i^13 + \u2211_i=k+1^30a_i \u2113_i^13 = \u2211_i=k+1^rb_i m_i^13.\n\n  Therefore, we can proceed with the same argument as before by considering f_0 instead of f and Z = Z_1 \u222a Z\u201d to deduce that \u2113(Z_1) \u2265\u2113(Z\u201d) \u2265 30. \n\nTherefore, we have that Z_1 and Z_2 have different Hilbert function and regularity by (<ref>) and both compute the rank of f by Claim <ref>. This concludes the proof.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 EXPLICIT MACAULAY2 COMPUTATIONS\n\nIn this last section, we provide a code in the language of the algebra software Macaulay2 <cit.> to construct the examples presented in the previous section. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 First example.
