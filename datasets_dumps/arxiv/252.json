This inequality, which is of course amply satisfied by such objects, signals, however, a breakdown of conventional perturbation theory, since the effective coupling to gravity is not small. Therefore scattering amplitudes, which are organized as a weak-coupling G-expansion, must  actually be supplemented with a nonperturbative principle in order to correctly capture the classical limit. \n\nOne such guiding principle, which is also familiar from the non-relativistic WKB approximation, is that in the classical limit the S-matrix should be dominated by the exponential e^2i\u03b4 of a large phase 2\u03b4, which plays the role of a large action in units of \u0127. For the elastic 2\u21922 amplitude this resummation is known as the eikonal exponentiation and the eikonal phase, or the closely related radial action, has been employed to extract from the amplitude the deflection angle(s) for two-body collisions up to 4PM order <cit.>.\nThe nonperturbative nature of the problem manifests itself at each loop order via \u201csuperclassical\u201d or \u201citeration\u201d terms, contributions that scale with higher powers of the large ratio GM^2/\u0127, or, for short, of \u0127^-1. The eikonal exponentiation dictates how such spurious terms should be subtracted, by matching with the power series expansion of the exponential, and fixes all ambiguities associated to possible remainders, providing a direct connection to the impulse and to the deflection angle via a saddle point approximation <cit.>. \n\nHowever, by focusing on the elastic 2\u21922 amplitude, the conventional eikonal framework fails to capture possible subtractions associated to inelastic channels. For instance the infrared (IR) divergent imaginary part in the 3PM eikonal signals the fact that at \ud835\udcaa(G^3) an inelastic 3-particle channel involving the two massive states and a graviton opens up, and the standard eikonal exponentiation does not capture it.\nThis problem has been studied and solved in <cit.>, the basic idea being that, in a more comprehensive framework, the eikonal should be promoted to the exponential of i times a suitable Hermitian operator that is able to appropriately combine all needed channels. The approach of Ref.\u00a0<cit.> is to apply this principle to the full S-matrix, writing S = e^iN with N^\u2020= N and building N-matrix elements out of  conventional scattering amplitudes, which are of course T-matrix elements with S = 1 + iT.\n\nA complementary approach is provided by the formalism first introduced by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC) <cit.> and later developed in Refs.\u00a0<cit.>. This framework is based on the principle that, after identifying a well-defined classical observable O associated to the collision, its expectation value in the final state dictated by the S-matrix, \u27e8in| S^\u2020 O S |in\u27e9 (minus its expectation in the initial state \u27e8in| O |in\u27e9 if nonzero) will be free of superclassical terms and thus possesses a well-defined classical limit. The state |in\u27e9 models the two incoming massive particles with given impact parameter(s) via an appropriate superposition of plane-wave states built with suitable wave-packets, whose details become immaterial after the cancellation of superclassical terms.\n\nIn this paper, we explore further the exponentiation in the classical limit and the connection between amplitudes and classical observables. We focus on the 2\u21923 amplitude for the scattering of two minimally-coupled massive scalars plus the emission of a single graviton in General Relativity, whose loop expansion reads \ud835\udc9c^\u03bc\u03bd=\ud835\udc9c_0^\u03bc\u03bd+\ud835\udc9c_1^\u03bc\u03bd+\u22ef, or, pictorially,\n\n    [draw, ultra thick, blue] (-4.5,2.2)\u2013(-1.5,2.2);\n    \t [draw, ultra thick, green!60!black] (-4.5,.8)\u2013(-1.5,.8);\n    \t [draw, red] (-3,1.5)\u2013(-1.5,1.5);\n    \t[white, very thick] (-3,1.5) ellipse (.7 and 1);\n    \t[pattern=north west lines, very thick] (-3,1.5) ellipse (.7 and 1);\n     \n    =\n      [draw, ultra thick, blue] (-4.5,2.2)\u2013(-1.5,2.2);\n    \t\t [draw, ultra thick, green!60!black] (-4.5,.8)\u2013(-1.5,.8);\n    \t\t [draw, red] (-3,1.5)\u2013(-1.5,1.5);\n    \t\t[black!20!white, thick] (-3,1.5) ellipse (.7 and 1);\n    \t\t[thick] (-3,1.5) ellipse (.7 and 1);\n    \t \n    +\n      [draw, ultra thick, blue] (-4.5,2.2)\u2013(-1.5,2.2);\n    \t\t [draw, ultra thick, green!60!black] (-4.5,.8)\u2013(-1.5,.8);\n    \t\t [draw, red] (-3,1.5)\u2013(-1.5,1.5);\n    \t\t[black!20!white, thick] (-3,1.5) ellipse (.7 and 1);\n    \t\t[thick] (-3,1.5) ellipse (.7 and 1);\n    \t\t[white, thick] (-3,1.5) ellipse (.3 and .4);\n    \t\t[pattern=none, thick] (-3,1.5) ellipse (.3 and .4);\n    \t \n    +\u22ef\n\nand discuss the calculation of its 1-loop part, \ud835\udc9c_1^\u03bc\u03bd, starting from the integrand provided in Ref.\u00a0<cit.>. We focus on the non-analytic terms in the near-forward limit, whereby the transferred momentum and the emitted graviton's momentum are simultaneously taken to be small, \ud835\udcaa (\u0127), in comparison with the particles' masses, \ud835\udcaa (\u0127^0). To this end we apply the method of regions and restrict our attention to the soft region, in which the loop momentum assigned to the exchanged gravitons is also small, \ud835\udcaa (\u0127). We employ dimensional regularization, letting \u03f5= 4-D/2, and express the result as a Laurent expansion around \u03f5=0.\n\nThe calculation of \ud835\udc9c_1^\u03bc\u03bd in the soft region constitutes one of the main new results of this work, and represents a first step in generalizing the studies of graviton emissions during collisions of ultrarelativistic or massless objects <cit.> to the case of massive objects with generic velocities. The amplitude \ud835\udc9c_1^\u03bc\u03bd, as expected, involves both superclassical, \ud835\udcaa (\u0127^-2), and classical, \ud835\udcaa (\u0127^-1), contributions, for each of which we calculate both infrared (IR) divergent and finite terms. For the IR divergent pieces, we find complete agreement with the well-known exponential pattern <cit.> according to which IR divergences in a given one-loop amplitude are equal to a one-loop-exact divergent factor \ud835\udcb2 times the tree-level amplitude with the same external states <cit.>.\n\nIn the Weinberg limit, in which the emitted graviton's frequency becomes very small, k^\u03bc\u223c\ud835\udcaa(\u03bb) with \u03bb\u21920, the one-loop amplitude \ud835\udc9c_1^\u03bc\u03bd must also exhibit \ud835\udcaa(\u03bb^-1) terms whose form is completely fixed by the leading soft graviton theorem <cit.> as the factor \u2131^\u03bc\u03bd = \u221a(8\u03c0 G)\u2211_n p_n^\u03bc p_n^\u03bd / (p_n\u00b7 k) times the 2\u21922 one-loop amplitude without graviton emissions. This 1/\u03bb pole is a frequency-space manifestation of the memory effect <cit.>. Comparing with the results available from the literature <cit.>, we find perfect agreeement with this prediction, reproducing in particular the terms arising from the 2PM deflection encoded in one-loop 2\u21922 \u201ctriangle\u201d contributions, i.e.\u00a0from the sub-leading eikonal phase 2\u03b4_1.\nMoreover, exploiting the conventional exponentiation of the 2\u21922 amplitude, this factorization allows us to check the inelastic exponentiation of Refs.\u00a0<cit.> to leading order in the soft limit. Throughout the paper, we focus on emitted gravitons with positive frequencies, so that we do not include in our analysis  terms with support localized at \u03c9=0 in frequency space, which are associated to static effects in time domain (see e.g.\u00a0<cit.> for their concrete appearance in the tree-level expressions). The inclusion of such terms has been discussed in <cit.> and can be typically performed by means an appropriate dressing of the initial and final states with a modified Weinberg factor \u221a(8\u03c0 G)\u2211_n p_n^\u03bc p_n^\u03bd / (p_n\u00b7 k-i0).\n\nAfter constructing the appropriate subtractions dictated by the N-matrix formalism <cit.>, we calculate the 2\u21923, N-matrix element \u212c_1^\u03bc\u03bd  from the amplitude \ud835\udc9c_1^\u03bc\u03bd. In this way we obtain a purely classical object, \u212c_1^\u03bc\u03bd, which is also real and free of IR divergences. \nIndeed, by comparing the operator power series N = -ilog(1+iT) = T - i/2T^2+ \u22ef and the unitarity constraint i(T^\u2020-T) = T^\u2020 T, it is easy to see that, at one loop, the operator exponentiation of <cit.> boils down to simply dropping the imaginary parts of the amplitude, i.e.\u00a0to subtracting its unitarity cuts, 2Im\ud835\udc9c_1^\u03bc\u03bd = \u2211(cuts). For the process under considerations, there are four distinct channels, which we depict in Table\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\nTwo of them, often referred to as s and s', involve cutting an intermediate state with two massive particles, and we shall call them collectively \u201cS-channel\u201d. We find that the subtraction of the S-channel is actually enough to get rid of all superclassical terms. This is in accordance with Refs.\u00a0<cit.>, since this subtraction in momentum space is equivalent in b-space to the subtraction of 2i\u03b4_0 \ud835\udc9c\u0303_0^\u03bc\u03bd. Indeed, since this cut contributes schematically via +i/2(S-channel) to the amplitude and each of the two diagrams in the first line of Table\u00a0<ref> contributes as 2\u03b4_0 \ud835\udc9c\u0303_0^\u03bc\u03bd in b-space, it is crucial to consider both diagrams in order to get the right combinatoric factor in front. \n\nThe remaining two cuts in Table\u00a0<ref>, s_1 and s_2, instead involve an intermediate state with a massive particle and a graviton, in which the latter re-scatters against the massive line in the gravitational analog of a Compton process. For this reason, we may call them collectively \u201cC-channel\u201d.\nAlbeit classical as far as the \u0127 scaling is concerned, the C-channel involves an infrared divergence and its subtraction is crucial in order to make the resulting \u212c_1^\u03bc\u03bd (real and) finite as \u03f5\u21920.\n\nThe amplitude \ud835\udc9c_1^\u03bc\u03bd, and the N-matrix element \u212c_1^\u03bc\u03bd, encode the dynamical information needed  in order to evaluate the \ud835\udcaa(G^3) corrections to asymptotic value of the metric fluctuation far away from the collision, which provide the next order in the PM expansion compared to the results of Refs.\u00a0<cit.>. For this reason we investigate the construction of the associated KMOC kernel, i.e.\u00a0the object whose Fourier transform from q-space to b-space provides the waveform in frequency domain. \nWe find that this kernel is not simply given by i\u212c_1^\u03bc\u03bd, as perhaps expected. Rather, it equals i\u212c_1^\u03bc\u03bd plus 12 times the IR divergent C-channel cuts. By its very nature, the associated IR pole in 1/\u03f5 can be exponentiated to a q-independent phase, amounting to a (divergent) shift of the origin of the observer's retarded time, at the price of introducing a logarithm involving an unspecified scale in the finite part. Neither the phase nor this logarithm appear in the energy-momentum spectra, and could as such be considered \u201charmless\u201d.\nThe appearance of potentially ambiguous logarithms in the waveform, as a result of the long-range nature of the gravitational force, is a known issue and is often fixed by the appropriate treatment of so-called tail or rescattering effects <cit.>. We leave further investigations of this issue for future work, together with the calculation of the (b-space) waveform and with a comparison with subleading log\u03bb-corrected soft theorems <cit.>, which are also intimately related with long-range corrections to the asyptotic interactions.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section\u00a0<ref> we present our conventions for dealing with the external states of the scattering, illustrating a useful choice of variables and polarizations, while more details on them are available in Appendix\u00a0<ref>. In Section\u00a0<ref> we discuss the classical limit and how focusing on the soft region  simplifies the integration. We list the corresponding 9 independent master integrals in Appendix\u00a0<ref> and in the file . Section\u00a0<ref> is devoted to illustrating our result for the amplitude, which is collected in computer-readable format in the file , discussing the consistency checks offered by the exponentiation of IR divergences and from factorization in the soft limit. We also discuss the implications of unitarity and the subtraction of superclassical iterations, explicitly proving the leading constraint coming from the inelastic exponentiation. The tree-level amplitudes needed to perform such checks are presented in Appendix\u00a0<ref>.\nIn Section\u00a0<ref>, we discuss the calculation of the gravitational field, of the associated spectrum and of the asymptotic waveform, before presenting a summary of our conclusions and a prospect of possible future directions in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n  \n*Conventions: We employ the mostly-plus signature, \u03b7_\u03bc\u03bd = diag(-,+,+,+). All momenta are regarded as formally outgoing, so that p_3, p_4 and k are the physical momenta of the final states of the scattering, while p_1 and p_2 are minus the physical momenta of the initial states.\n\n\n\n  \n*Note added: While working on this project we became aware of independent progress by \nRefs.\u00a0<cit.>, whose scope partly overlaps with our analysis.\nThese groups' work was also presented as a series of seminars <cit.> at the \u201cQCD Meets Gravity 2022\u201d conference.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 KINEMATICS\n\n\n\nWe consider the scattering of two massive objects with masses m_1 (depicted with a thick blue line) and m_2 (thick green line) and the emission of a graviton (thin red line),\n\n    \ud835\udc9c^\u03bc\u03bd = \t[scale=1]\n    \t\t\t[<-] (-4.8,5.17)\u2013(-4.2,5.17);\n    \t\t\t[<-] (-1,5.15)\u2013(-1.6,5.15);\n    \t\t\t[<-] (-1,3.15)\u2013(-1.6,3.15);\n    \t\t\t[<-] (-1,.85)\u2013(-1.6,.85);\n    \t\t\t[<-] (-4.8,.83)\u2013(-4.2,.83);\n    \t\t\t[<-] (-2.85,1.7)\u2013(-2.85,2.4);\n    \t\t\t[<-] (-2.85,4.3)\u2013(-2.85,3.6);\n    \t\t\t [draw, ultra thick, blue] (-5,5)\u2013(-3,5)\u2013(-1,5);\n    \t\t\t [draw, ultra thick, color=green!60!black] (-5,1)\u2013(-3,1)\u2013(-1,1);\n    \t\t\t [draw, color=red] (-3,3)\u2013(-1,3);\n    \t\t\t [draw] (-3,1)\u2013(-3,5);\n    \t\t\t[dashed] (-3,3) ellipse (1.3 and 2.3);\n    \t\t\t at (-1,3)[below]k;\n    \t\t\t at (-5,5)[left]p_1;\n    \t\t\t at (-5,1)[left]p_2;\n    \t\t\t at (-1,5)[right]p_4;\n    \t\t\t at (-1,1)[right]p_3;\n    \t\t\t at (-2.8,4)[right]q_1;\n    \t\t\t at (-2.8,2)[right]q_2;\n\nwith \n\n    p_1^2 = p_4^2 = -m_1^2 ,    \n    \tp_2^2 = p_3^2 = -m_2^2 ,    \n    \tk^2 = 0 .\n\nThe figure in (<ref>) is meant to help remembering the definition of the \u201ctransferred momenta\u201d q_1, q_2,\n\n    q_1 = p_1+p_4 ,    \n    \tq_2 = p_2+p_3 ,    \n    \tq_1+q_2+k=0\n\nand does not represent an actual topology.\nLet us begin by discussing a useful choice of variables.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Physical variables\n\n\nWe let\n\n    p_1^\u03bc=-m\u0305_1 u_1^\u03bc+q_1^\u03bc/2  ,      p_4^\u03bc = m\u0305_1 u_1^\u03bc + q_1^\u03bc/2 \n       p_2^\u03bc=-m\u0305_2 u_2^\u03bc +q_2^\u03bc/2  ,      p_3^\u03bc = m\u0305_2 u_2^\u03bc + q_2^\u03bc/2\n\nwith \n\n    u_1^2 = -1 = u_2^2 ,    \n    \ty=-u_1\u00b7 u_2\u22651.\n\nIn this way,\n\n    u_1\u00b7 q_1 = 0 ,     u_2\u00b7 q_2=0 ,\n\nand\n\n    m\u0305_1^2 = m_1^2 + q_1^2/4,     m\u0305_2^2 = m_2^2 + q_2^2/4 .\n\nThe momentum transfers q_1^\u03bc and q_2^\u03bc are not independent because of momentum conservation  (<ref>) and of the mass-shell condition k^2=0, \nwhich implies\n\n    q_1\u00b7 q_2 = -1/2(q_1^2+q_2^2) .\n\nFive independent invariant Lorentz products can be taken as follows: \n\n    y = -u_1\u00b7 u_2 ,    \u03c9_1= u_1\u00b7 q_2 ,    \u03c9_2=u_2\u00b7 q_1 ,    \n    \tq_1^2 ,    \n    \tq_2^2 .\n\n\nThe variable y is the relative Lorentz factor of two observers with four-velocities u_1^\u03bc, u_2^\u03bc. Letting v\u0305 denote the velocity of the former as seen from the rest frame of the latter (or vice-versa),\n\n    y = 1/\u221a(1-v\u0305^2) .\n  \nUsing (<ref>), we see that \u03c9_1 and \u03c9_2 are the frequency of the graviton measured by these two observers,\n\n    \u03c9_1= -u_1\u00b7 k\u2265 0 ,    \u03c9_2= -u_2\u00b7 k\u2265 0 .\n\n\nIn order to simplify square roots that frequently appear in the calculations, it is convenient to define the following dimensionless variables\n\n    x = y-\u221a(y^2-1) ,    \n    \tw_1 = \u03c9_1+\u221a(\u03c9_1^2+q_2^2)/q_2 ,    \n    \tw_2 = \u03c9_2+\u221a(\u03c9_2^2+q_1^2)/q_1 ,\n\nwith the inverse relations given by\n\n    y = 1/2(x+1/x),    \u03c9_1= q_2/2(w_1- 1/w_1),    \u03c9_2= q_1/2(w_2-1/w_2)\n\nso that they obey the inequalities\n\n    0<x\u2264 1 ,    \n    \tw_1\u22651 ,    \n    \tw_2\u22651 .\n\nThe limit x\u2192 0 corresponds to the high-energy (ultrarelativistic) regime and x\u2192 1 to the low-energy one. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Polarization tensor\n\n\n\nIt is convenient to contract the amplitude with an appropriate polarization tensor, which we can build as follows.\nWe start from a vector \n\n    \u03b5^\u03bc = c_1 u_1^\u03bc + c_2 u_2^\u03bc + d_1 q_1^\u03bc + d_2 q_2^\u03bc\n\nwith generic coefficients c_1, c_2, d_1, d_2.\nWe solve the transversality condition,\n\n    k^\u03bc\u03b5_\u03bc = - (q_1+q_2)^\u03bc\u03b5_\u03bc = 0 ,\n\nby letting\n\n    d_1 = d_+ - d_- ,     d_2 = d_+ + d_- ,    \n    \td_- = c_1 \u03c9_1 + c_2 \u03c9_2/q_1^2-q_2^2 .\n\n\nWe then define the polarization tensor\n\n    \u03b5^\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b5^\u03bc\u03b5^\u03bd .\n\nThis transverse, thanks to (<ref>). It can be also made traceless and related to more standard choices of graviton polarizations as detailed in Appendix\u00a0<ref>. \nWe introduce the symbol\n\n    \ud835\udc9c_1^ = \u03b5_\u03bc\ud835\udc9c_1^\u03bc\u03bd\u03b5_\u03bd\n\nto denote the contracted amplitude.\nDefining\n\n    \u03b5\u0302^\u03bc   = \u03b5^\u03bc - d_+ (q_1+q_2)^\u03bc=  \u03b5^\u03bc  + d_+ k^\u03bc ,\n\ngauge invariance requires that we can freely replace \u03b5^\u03bc with \u03b5\u0302^\u03bc\n\n    \ud835\udc9c_1 = \u03b5\u0302_\u03bc\ud835\udc9c_1^\u03bc\u03bd\u03b5\u0302_\u03bd .\n\nThe new polarization vector (<ref>) is independent of d_+, which thus constitutes a free parameter that ought to drop out from the final expression. This serves as a very useful cross-check of the calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CLASSICAL LIMIT AND INTEGRATION\n\n\n\nLet us spell out the decomposition of our amplitude in the classical or near-forward limit. \nIn this regime the momentum transfers q_1, q_2 are taken to be simultaneously small with respect to the masses of the incoming particles, or, equivalently, the masses are taken to be large with respect to the exchanged momenta. We can therefore use a common scaling parameter as a bookkeeping device for the associated power counting. We shall use \u0127 for this bookkeeping purpose and define the scaling by\n\n    q_1,2\u223c\ud835\udcaa(\u0127) ,    m\u0305_1,2\u223c u_1,2\u223c\ud835\udcaa(\u0127^0 ) ,    \u03b5\u223c\ud835\udcaa(\u0127^0) ,    \u0127\u2192 0 .\n\nWe emphasize again that (<ref>) only serves to keep track of powers of the transferred momenta and does not refer to the actual dependence of the amplitude on the Planck constant after restoring standard units <cit.>. \nWe shall also scale the integrated momentum  \u2113 associated to exchanged gravitons in the same way as the exchanged momenta q_1,2,\n\n    \u2113\u223c\ud835\udcaa(\u0127) .\n \nThis enforces the expansion for the loop integrals in the soft region, which is the appropriate one to capture all the non-analytic dependence on q_1, q_2 in the amplitude.\nFrom Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), it also follows that\n\n    k\u223c\ud835\udcaa(\u0127) ,    \n    \tc_1,2\u223c\ud835\udcaa(\u0127^0) ,    \n    \td_1,2\u223c\ud835\udcaa(\u0127^-1) ,\n\nwhere c_1,2 and d_1,2 are the decomposition coefficients in (<ref>).\n\nWe follow the numbering of the 24 topologies, \ud835\udca2_j with j=1,\u2026,24, associated to the integrand numerators given in Ref.\u00a0<cit.>, which are depicted in Table\u00a0<ref>\n\nand can be grouped into five families as in Table\u00a0<ref>.\n\nAs we shall discuss in the Subsection\u00a0<ref>, all integrals belonging to the P, P', M and M' families can be mapped to a collection of linearized pentagon integrals.\nThe 5 integrals of the quantum family are manifestly associated to intermediate processes, like creation of black-hole-/anti-black-hole pairs, which ought be disregarded in the classical limit, and indeed the associated integrals vanish in the soft region.\nIn this way, the 16 master integrals in Table\u00a0<ref> below suffice to decompose the integrand via Integration By Parts and to evaluate the resulting integrals relevant for our purposes.\n\nEach of the 16 numerators belonging the  P, P', M and M' families should be multiplied by the appropriate propagators dictated by its diagram, and summed over the 8 independent permutations \n\n    P_8 = {\u03c3_1, \u03c3_2, \u03c3_3, \u03c3_4, \u03c3_2\u03c3_3, \u03c3_3\u03c3_4, \u03c3_2\u03c3_4,\u03c3_2\u03c3_3\u03c3_4\n    \t}\n\ngenerated by the following ones,\n\n\t\n  \u03c3_1: The trivial transformation (identity element).\n\t\n  \u03c3_2: The permutation interchanging the endpoints of the blue line in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), sending u_1^\u03bc\u21a6  -u_1^\u03bc and correspondingly[In principle also x\u21a6-x corresponds to changing the sign of y, but the transformation in (<ref>) is the one that leaves \u221a(y^2-1)=12(x+1x) invariant. For the same reason, one discards w_1\u21a6-w_1.]\n\t\n    y \u21a6  -y ,    \u03c9_1\u2192 -\u03c9_1 ;    \n    \t\tx \u21a6 -1/x ,\n    \t\t     w_1 \u21a61/w_1 .\n\n\t\n  \u03c3_3: The permutation interchanging the endpoints of the green line in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), sending u_2^\u03bc\u21a6  -u_2^\u03bc and correspondingly\n\t\n    y \u21a6  -y ,    \u03c9_2\u21a6 -\u03c9_2 ;\n    \t\t    \n    \t\tx \u21a6 -1/x ,     w_2 \u21a61/w_2 .\n\n\t\n  \u03c3_4: Particle-interchange symmetry, which corresponds to replacing the blue line with the green one and vicevesa, and to interchanging all particle labels 1\u21942.\n\nOf course, these operations should be performed while leaving \u03b5^\u03bc in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) invariant. For this reason, after expanding it as in (<ref>), one should compensate for the transformations of the basis vectors by also sending  c_1\u21a6 -c_1 (resp. c_2\u21a6 -c_2) when performing \u03c3_2 (resp. \u03c3_3) and by sending c_1\u2194 c_2, d_1 \u2194 d_2 when performing \u03c3_4. Moreover, each diagram should only be summed over its nontrivial permutations. Equivalently, when summing over the whole P_8, each diagram should be supplied with the appropriate symmetry factor s_i accounting for the fact that a subset of the permutations may leave it invariant. Massless bubble diagrams \ud835\udca2_20, \ud835\udca2_23 carry an additional factor of 1/2 due to the freedom of relabeling the loop momentum.\n\nAfter evaluating the integrals in each family using the integration measure\n\n    \u222b_\u2113=\n    \te^\u03b3_E \u03f5\u222bd^4-2\u03f5\u2113/i\u03c0^2-\u03f5\n\nand summing over the allowed permutations, the last step is to multiply by the overall normalization factor \ud835\udca9 given by\n\n    \ud835\udca9 = e^-\u03b3_E\u03f5\u03bc^2\u03f5/(4\u03c0)^2-\u03f5(32\u03c0 G)^5/2 = \ud835\udca9_4  \u03bc\u0305^2\u03f5 ,    \ud835\udca9_4 = (32\u03c0 G)^5/2/(4\u03c0)^2 ,    \u03bc\u0305^2= 4\u03c0 e^-\u03b3_E\u03bc^2  ,\n\nwith \u03bc an arbitrary energy scale introduced by dimensional regularization.\nAll in all, we may summarize this construction as follows,\n\n    \ud835\udc9c_1 = \ud835\udca9\u2211_j=1^24\u222b_\u2113\u2211_\u03c3\u2208 P_8\u03c3[s_j \ud835\udca2_j/den_j].\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Mapping to the pentagon family\n\n\n\nIn the limit (<ref>), with an appropriate choice of loop momentum routing, all integrals in the pentagon family can be mapped to the following collection of integrals\n\n    I_i_1,i_2,i_3,i_4,i_5\n    \t=\n    \t\u222b_\u21131/(2 u_1\u00b7\u2113)^i_1(-2u_2\u00b7\u2113)^i_2(\u2113^2)^i_3 ((\u2113+q_2)^2)^i_4((\u2113-q_1)^2)^i_5 .\n\nIn Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and in the following, the -i0 prescription is left implicit for brevity.\nThe family (<ref>) is obtained from the conventional scalar pentagon with two massive lines (the momentum flows clockwise in the loop and, as in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), the external momenta are all outgoing)\n\n    [draw, ultra thick, green!60!black] (-2,0)\u2013(2,0);\n    \t\t\t [draw, ultra thick, blue] (-2,3)\u2013(2,3);\n    \t\t\t [draw,thin] (-1.5,0)\u2013(-1.5,3);\n    \t\t\t [draw,thin] (1.5,0)\u2013(1.5,3);\n    \t\t\t [draw,thin] (1.5,1.5)\u2013(2,1.5);\n    \t\t\t at (2,1.5)[right]k;\n    \t\t\t at (-1.5,1.5)[left]\u2113;\n    \t\t\t at (0,3)[below]-p_1+\u2113;\n    \t\t\t at (0,0)[above]p_2+\u2113;\n    \t\t\t at (1.5,2.5)[right]\u2113-q_1;\n    \t\t\t at (1.5,0.5)[right]\u2113+q_2;\n\nby linearizing the two massive propagators and factoring out m\u0305_1, m\u0305_2:\n\n    1/(\u2113-p_1)^2+m_1   = 1/-2p_1\u00b7\u2113+\u2113^2= 1/2m\u0305_1 u_1\u00b7\u2113 +\u2113^2-q_1^2 = 1/m\u0305_11/(2u_1\u00b7\u2113) + \ud835\udcaa(\u0127^0) ,\n    1/(\u2113+p_2)^2+m_2   = 1/2p_2\u00b7\u2113+\u2113^2= 1/-2m\u0305_2 u_2\u00b7\u2113 +\u2113^2+q_2^2 = 1/m\u0305_21/(-2u_2\u00b7\u2113) + \ud835\udcaa(\u0127^0) .\n\nIn our conventions, the sign of each propagator is fixed due to the -i0 prescription, e.g.\n\n    1/(-2u_2\u00b7\u2113) = 1/-2u_2\u00b7\u2113-i0 ,      - 1/(2u_2\u00b7\u2113)  = - 1/2u_2\u00b7\u2113-i0 ,\n\nso that\n\n    1/(-2u_2\u00b7\u2113)+1/(2u_2\u00b7\u2113) = 2i\u03c0\u03b4(2u_2\u00b7\u2113) .\n\nA basis of for the family of integrals (<ref>), which determine all the others via Integration By Parts (IBP), can be obtained using \u00a0<cit.> and is given by the 16 elements in Table <ref> (although 7 of them can be deduced from the remaining 9 by using \u03c3_4).\nUsing \u00a0<cit.> and dimensional shift identities <cit.>, we have found the values of all such master integrals up to transcendental weight 2.

One can also first treat the two contributions to each equation as separate objects, perform the IBP reduction and mapping to the master integrals only for the appropriate permutation, and then perform all 8 permutations on the result.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Euclidean variables and analytic continuation\n\n\n\nThe amplitude is the boundary value of an analytic function which develops branch cuts when its variables are located in the physical region. For this reason it is convenient to introduce complex variables y_E, \u03c9_1E, \u03c9_2E such that the physical region corresponds to setting\n\n    y_E =- y-i0 ,    \u03c9_1E=-\u03c9_1-i0 ,    \u03c9_2E=-\u03c9_2-i0 ,\n\nwith y, \u03c9_1, \u03c9_2 the invariant products defined in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\nThe new variables allow for manifestly real expressions of the master integrals (<ref>) when they are taken in the Euclidean region, defined by\n\n    y_E\u22651 ,    \u03c9_1E\u2265 0 ,    \u03c9_2E\u22650 .\n\nWe similarly define new rationalized variables according to\n\n    x_E = y_E+ \u221a(y_E^2-1) ,    \n    \tw_1E = \u221a(\u03c9_1E^2+q_2^2)+\u03c9_1E/q_2 ,    \n    \tw_2 = \u221a(\u03c9_2E^2+q_1^2)+\u03c9_2E/q_1 ,\n\nso that\n\n    y_E = 1/2(x_E+1/x_E),    \u03c9_1E= q_2/2(w_1E-1/w_1E),    \u03c9_2E= q_1/2(w_2E-1/w_2E).\n\nThe rationalized variables fall in the physical region when\n\n    x_E = -x+i0 ,    \n    \tw_1E = -w_1-i0 ,    \n    \tw_2E = -w_2-i0 ,\n\nwith x, w_1, w_2 as in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\nThe conditions (<ref>) defining the Euclidean region instead translate to the following ones in terms of the rationalized variables,\n\n    x_E\u22651 ,    \n    \tw_1E\u22651 ,    \n    \tw_2E\u2265 1 .\n\n\nMapping back to the physical variables discussed in Subsection\u00a0<ref> via (<ref>), (<ref>), one encounters branch singularities when the variables fall in the physical region. We have expressed our  master integrals (see Appendix\u00a0<ref>) in terms of the  analytic functions\n\n    log x_E ,  log(x_E-1) ,  log w_1E ,  log(w_1E\u00b1 1) ,  log w_2E ,  log(w_2E\u00b1 1) ,\n\nand\n\n    Li_2(\u00b11/x_E),    Li_2(\u00b11/w_1E),    Li_2(\u00b11/w_2E)\n\nso that their expressions are manifestly real in the Euclidea region (<ref>).\nWe then perform the analytic continuation back to the physical region (<ref>) by letting\n\n    log x_E     \u2192log x + i q_I \u03c0 ,\n    log w_1E   \u2192log w_1  - i q_O \u03c0 ,\n    log w_2E   \u2192log w_2  - i q_A \u03c0 ,\n\nwhere we have kept all analytic continuations in principle arbitrary.\nWe find that, consistently with the i0 prescriptions in (<ref>) or equivalently by demanding consistency with the exponentiation of infrared divergences (see Subsection\u00a0<ref>), \n\n    q_I = q_O = q_A = +1 .\n\nThe sign of the i0 prescription q_I for x_E matches the elastic calculation in <cit.> where for instance in the double box solution log x_E \u2192log x +i\u03c0.\nThe elementary choices made in (<ref>) then resolve all other branch ambiguities upon reducing the analytic continuation of the dilogarithms to those of conventional logarithms via\n\n    Li_2(1/z) = - Li_2(z) - \u03c0^2/6 - 1/2(log (-z))^2 ,\n\nwhich holds whenever z doesn't belong to the positive real axis.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 STRUCTURE OF THE AMPLITUDE IN THE CLASSICAL LIMIT\n\n\n\nLooking at the integrand obtained by combining the diagrams in Table\u00a0<ref>, we find the following structure in the limit (<ref>), (<ref>) (including the scaling of the measure element d^4\u2113),\n\n    \ud835\udc9c_1^ = \ud835\udc9c_1^[-3] + \ud835\udc9c_1^[-2] + \ud835\udc9c_1^[-1] + \ud835\udcaa(\u0127^0) ,\n\nwhere\n\n    \ud835\udc9c^[-j]\u223c\ud835\udcaa(\u0127^-j) .\n\nWe expand each coefficient for small \u03f5=4-D/2, defining\n\n    \ud835\udc9c_1^[-j] = \u03bc\u0305^2\u03f5[\ud835\udc9c_1^[-j,-2]/\u03f5^2 + \ud835\udc9c_1^[-j,-1]/\u03f5  + \ud835\udc9c_1^[-j,0] + \ud835\udcaa(\u03f5)].\n\nThe first (second) index within square brackets thus refers to the  \u0127 (resp.\u00a0\u03f5) scaling.\n\nAfter inputting the values of the master integrals, we find that (for nonzero graviton frequencies)\n\n    \ud835\udc9c_1^[-3] = \ud835\udcaa(\u03f5) .\n\nThis cancellation is expected because it mirrors a similar one occurring for the tree-level amplitude \ud835\udc9c_0, whose classical limit also naively goes like \u0127^-3 (and it indeed involves terms localized at zero frequency at that order), while its actual scaling is \u0127^-2 in our present conventions. Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) also serves a nontrivial check of the symmetry factors because it relies on s_3 = 2s_1 and on s_6+s_24=s_11+s_14. \nWe also find that the coefficient of the double pole in \u03f5 vanishes,\n\n    \ud835\udc9c_1^[-j,-2]=0 ,     j=2,1 .\n\nFor instance, both \ud835\udca2_2, \ud835\udca2_4 and \ud835\udca2_9 would naively diverge like 1/\u03f5^2 to order \ud835\udcaa(\u0127^-2), but thanks to the transversality condition (<ref>) such divergences cancel between \ud835\udca2_2 and \ud835\udca2_9, and separately in \ud835\udca2_4. This serves as a cross check that s_2=s_9. This cancellation is also expected on general grounds <cit.> as we shall discuss more in detail shortly.\n\nTaking into account the vanishing of these coefficients, we find the following structure of the amplitude in the classical limit,  \n\n    \ud835\udc9c_1 = \u03bc\u0305^2\u03f5{[\ud835\udc9c_1^[-2,-1]/\u03f5 + \ud835\udc9c_1^[-2,0]] + [\ud835\udc9c_1^[-1,-1]/\u03f5 + \ud835\udc9c_1^[-1,0]]\n    + \ud835\udcaa(\u03f5)+\ud835\udcaa(\u0127^0) }.\n\nThe functions \ud835\udc9c_1^[-2,-1], \ud835\udc9c_1^[-2,0], \ud835\udc9c_1^[-1,-1], \ud835\udc9c_1^[-1,0] constitute the main results of the present work and are all provided in the ancillary files in attachment, where for convenience we collect their expressions after dividing by \ud835\udca9_4 defined in (<ref>).\nWe have checked that our expressions for the classical terms, \ud835\udc9c_1^[-1,-1] and \ud835\udc9c_1^[-1,0], agree with the results of Ref.\u00a0<cit.> on numerical points, up to an  overall sign.\nIn its turn, this also ensures agreement with the results of Ref.\u00a0<cit.>.\nThe remainder of this section is devoted to the discussion and illustration of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\n\nWe find that the coefficients of the \u03f5^-1 poles, \ud835\udc9c_1^[-2,-1], \ud835\udc9c_1^[-1,-1], are in complete agreement with the prediction obtained from the exponentiation of infrared divergences, which fixes them in terms of the tree-level  five-point amplitude \ud835\udc9c_0 times a universal factor <cit.>.

When expressed in terms of \n    log x ,    log(1\u00b1 x) ,    log w_1,2 ,    log(w_1,2\u00b1 1) ,    log(q_1,2)\n \nand \n\n    Li_2(x) ,    Li_2(1/w_1,2) ,\n\nall dependence on the logarithms and dilogarithms drops out in such terms, so that they reduce to rational functions of the invariants x, w_1, w_2 in (<ref>), q_1 and q_2 times \u03c0^2. After this simplification, the structure of this piece is thus analogous to that of the \ud835\udcaa(\u0127^-1) in the elastic 2\u21922 amplitude at one loop (Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) below).\n\nThe terms that multiply the imaginary unit in \ud835\udc9c_1^[-1,0]/\ud835\udca9_4 (and similarly the combination  \ud835\udc9c_1^[-2,0]/\ud835\udca9_4), instead, can have transcendental weight either 2, i.e.\u00a0reduce to rational functions times the logarithms (<ref>) times i\u03c0, or 1, i.e.\u00a0reduce to rational functions times i\u03c0.\nSchematically,\n\n    \ud835\udc9c_1^[-1,0]/\ud835\udca9_4 = \u03c0^2 \n    \tQ(x,w_1,w_2,q_1,q_2)\n    \t+\n    \ti\u03c0[\n    \t\u2211_j (log x_j)  R_j(x,w_1,w_2,q_1,q_2)\n    \t+\n    \tS(x,w_1,w_2,q_1,q_2)\n    \t]\n\nwhere Q, R_j and S are real, rational functions of the invariants and log x_j are the logarithms (<ref>).\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Exponentiation of infrared divergences\n\n\n\nInfrared divergences in gravity amplitudes follow a simple exponential patter first clarified by Weinberg <cit.> (see also <cit.>), \n\n    \ud835\udc9c_\u03b1\u2192\u03b2 = e^\ud835\udcb2_\u03b1\u2192\u03b2 [\ud835\udc9c_\u03b1\u2192\u03b2]_ IR finite\n\nwith \ud835\udcb2_\u03b1\u2192\u03b2 an infrared-divergent, one-loop-exact exponent whose expression in terms of the states \u03b1, \u03b2 takes a universal form.\nAccordingly, the infrared divergences of any one-loop five-point amplitude are equal to\n\n    \ud835\udcb2 = G/2\u03c0\u03f5\u2211_n,m=1^5 w_nm\n\ntimes the tree-level five-point amplitude with the same external states.\nWhen the 5 particles are massive, letting (\u03b7_n is +1 if n is outgoing and -1 if n is incoming)\n\n    \u03b6_nm = - \u03b7_n \u03b7_m p_n\u00b7 p_m > 0   ,\n\nwe have\n\n    w_nm = \u03b6_nm^2- 12  m_n^2m_m^2/\u221a(\u03b6_nm^2-m_n^2m_m^2)[\n    \t\u03b7_n\u03b7_m \n    \tlog\u03b6_nm+\u221a(\u03b6_nm^2-m_n^2m_m^2)/\u03b6_nm-\u221a(\u03b6_nm^2-m_n^2m_m^2)\n    \t- i\u03c0\u03b7_nm]\n\nwhere \u03b7_nm = +1 provided n\u2260 m and n and m are both outgoing or both incoming, and vanishes otherwise.\nMoreover w_nn = m_n^2/2.\nWhen m_5\u21920 and p_5\u2192 k, the function \ud835\udcb2 is smooth and reduces to\n\n    \ud835\udcb2 = G/2\u03c0\u03f5\u2211_n,m=1^4 w_nm  + G/2\u03c0\u03f5\u2211_n=1^42(-p_n\u00b7 k)[log4(p_n\u00b7 k)^2/\u039b^2 m_n^2-i\u03c0\u03b7_n5]\n\nwith \u039b an arbitrary energy scale.\nOne can explicitly check this by taking the limit in (<ref>) and by using momentum conservation\n\n    p_1+p_2+p_4+p_4 = -k\n\nto show that a potentially dangerous log m_5 cancels out, leaving behind an arbitrary reference scale \u039b in the logarithm in (<ref>).\nAll in all, this dictates the IR divergences of our amplitude,\n\n    \ud835\udc9c_1 = \ud835\udcb2\ud835\udc9c_0 + \ud835\udcaa(\u03f5^0) ,\n\nwith \ud835\udc9c_0 = \u03b5_\u03bc\ud835\udc9c_0^\u03bc\u03bd\u03b5_\u03bd the tree-level five-point amplitude (<ref>). In particular, (<ref>) predicts that no double pole 1/\u03f5^2 should occur and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is consistent with this prediction.\n\nWe checked that, expanding to leading and subleading\norder in \u0127, \n\n    \ud835\udcb2 = \ud835\udcb2^[0] +\n    \t\ud835\udcb2^[1] + \ud835\udcaa(\u0127^2) ,\n\nwhere\n\n    \ud835\udcb2^[0]\n    \t=\n    \t-i  2G m\u0305_1 m\u0305_2 (y ^2-12)/\u03f5 \u221a(y ^2-1) ,\n    \t    \ud835\udcb2^[1] = -

(<ref>).\nTo see why this is not the case, let us denote by\n\n    E(k) = G( m_1 \u03c9_1 + m_2 \u03c9_2)\n \nthe combination appearing in the log\u03bc\u0305^2 terms, which is insensitive to the Fourier transform (<ref>).\nTerms of type \u212c_0  E log\u03bc\u0305^2 in the imaginary part \u2133_1 of waveform kernel enter the spectral rate via\n\n    \u212c\u0303_0^\u2217\u212c\u0303_0 E(k) log\u03bc\u0305^2 - E(k)\u212c\u0303_0 \u212c\u0303_0^\u2217log\u03bc\u0305^2 = 0 .\n\nIn this way, we see that the log\u03bc\u0305^2 terms in (<ref>) do not contribute to the spectral rate and a fortiori to the energy emission spectrum.\n\nOne then considers a detector with four-velocity t^\u03bc placed at a spatial distance r from the scattering event in the angular direction characterized by the null vector n\u0302^\u03bc, so that\n\n    x^\u03bc = u  t^\u03bc + r n\u0302^\u03bd ,    n\u0302\u00b7 t=-1 ,\n\nand takes the asymptotic limit\n\n    r\u2192\u221e ,    \n

information extracted from the one-loop amplitude can be used to build the \ud835\udcaa(G^3) corrections to the asymptotic metric fluctuation \u221a(32\u03c0 G) h_\u03bc\u03bd, and its IR-divergent phase can be formally reabsorbed via a redefinition of the detector's retarded time.\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\n\n\nIn this paper we calculated the 2\u21923 amplitude for the collision of two massive scalars and the emission of a graviton.\nWe focused on the near-forward regime, where the exchanged momenta are small, \ud835\udcaa(\u0127), compared to the masses, and on the soft region in which the loop momentum associated to the exchanged gravitons is of the same order. This allowed us to perform the integration  of the integrand first obtained in Ref.\u00a0<cit.>, calculating the result up to and including \ud835\udcaa(\u0127^-1) and \ud835\udcaa(\u03f5^0).\nThe result passes nontrivial consistency checks. It displays the appropriate structure of IR divergences predicted by Ref.\u00a0<cit.> as well as the correct factorization in the soft limit <cit.>.\nAfter checking that the operator version of the eikonal exponentiation <cit.> indeed works as expected and produces a classical, real and finite matrix element for the \u201ceikonal\u201d, or more precisely N-operator <cit.>, we sketched the calculation of the asymptotic waveform and spectral emission rates.\nWe derived an expression for such quantities, showed that the spectra are free of ambiguities, while the waveform itself is affected by an IR divergent phase or, once such an irrelevant phase is discarded, by the presence of the logarithm of an arbitrary scale.\n \nThe appearance of logarithms of (seemingly) arbitrary parameters left behind by infrared divergences in waveform calculations is usually cured  by the inclusion of hereditary or \u201ctail\u201d terms <cit.>. We leave further investigations of this point for future work. \nAnother interesting issue to which we plan to return is the comparison with subleading log-corrected soft theorems <cit.>, which are also intimately related to tail effects and to the long-range nature of the gravitational force in four spacetime dimensions. In analogy with the tree-level case, such checks will likely require to first obtain sufficient analytic control of the b-space expression of the waveform. More generally, but also in connection with the issue of infrared divergences, which here we removed by following the exponentiation <cit.>, it will be interesting to investigate how our results fit within the broader program of the eikonal operator and to understand whether an improved operator formalism is actually able to directly provide an infrared finite answer, possibly fixing the associated scale ambiguity.\nOf course, for all such open issues, extremely valuable guidance will come from  comparisons with the available PN results (see e.g.\u00a0Ref.\u00a0<cit.> and references therein).\n\nIn the spirit of reverse-unitarity applications for classical gravitational scattering <cit.>, our result can be useful for verifying and extending calculations of radiative observables to \ud835\udcaa(G^4), including emitted energy-momentum <cit.> and angular momentum (see Refs.\u00a0<cit.> for the analogous \ud835\udcaa(G^3) results).\nIn this work we focused on the \u03c9>0 portion of the graviton spectrum, although of course interesting phenomena are associated with static effects <cit.> and require taking into account terms localized at \u03c9=0. Such additional contributions can be typically included by means of suitable dressed states, and are likely to be important in order to correctly account for angular momentum losses.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Francesco Alessio, Paolo Di Vecchia, Kays Haddad, Martijn Hidding, Henrik Johansson, Stephen Naculich, Ben Page, Rodolfo Russo, Augusto Sagnotti, Fei Teng, and Gabriele Veneziano\nfor very useful discussions.\nThe research of CH is supported by the\nKnut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation under grant KAW 2018.0116.

All such vectors, except for those aligned with k^\u03bc, are spacelike, as can be easily seen by going to a frame where k^\u03bc = (\u03ba,0,0,\u03ba), where \u03be^t=\u03be^z and therefore \u03be^2 = (\u03be^x)^2+(\u03be^y)^2\u2265 0.\nWe can thus introduce \n\n    |\u03be_1| = \u221a(\u03be_1^2)\u2265 0 ,    \n    \t|\u03be_1| = \u221a(\u03be_2^2)\u2265 0 ,    \u0394 = 1 - (\u03be_1\u00b7\u03be_2)^2/\u03be_1^2\u03be_2^2\u2265 0 ,\n\nwhere the very last relation is the standard Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality.
