For small Knudsen numbers, the model is accurate up to the super-Burnett order, and the  resulting system of moment equations is shown to have a symmetric structure. We also propose Onsager boundary conditions for the moment equations that guarantees the stability of the equations. The validity of our model is verified by benchmark examples for the one-dimensional channel flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n \nThe modeling and computation of rarefied gas dynamics has been a classical research topic in the history of fluid mechanics. On one hand, significant progress has been made in the development of efficient solvers for the Boltzmann equation <cit.>; On the other hand, many researchers still try to avoid the high computational cost and find extensions of classical fluid models such as Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations and hope that the new models are capable of describing the motion of moderately rarefied gases. The moment method introduced by Grad <cit.> is one of the important approaches in this direction. While Grad's original method suffers from a number of deficiencies such as loss of hyperbolicity and convergence <cit.>, many new ideas have been proposed in the recent years to improve its robustness and make moment methods more widely applicable <cit.>. In this work, we will study the regularized version of Grad's 13-moment equations, which are originally proposed in <cit.> for Maxwell molecules and extended to general gases in <cit.>. In the literature, this model is called R13 equations for short. The R13 equations for Maxwell molecules have been verified for a variety of problems <cit.>. Recently, attentions have been drawn to the study of Onsager boundary conditions, which guarantees the stability of simulations of boundary value problems <cit.>. Here we will consider the formulation of Onsager boundary conditions for general R13 equations with arbitrary elastic collision models. The linearized Boltzmann equation will be taken as the base model, so that rigorous theory of stabilization can be established for the moment equations.\n\nIn the linearized setting, one typical form of the moment equations is as follows:\n\n    \ud835\udc00_0 \u2202/\u2202 t + \u2211_j=1^3 \ud835\udc00_j \u2202/\u2202 x_j = \ud835\udc0b,\n\nwhere \ud835\udc00_0 is symmetric positive semidefinite, and \ud835\udc0b is symmetric negative semidefinite. The matrices \ud835\udc00_j, j=1,2,3 are symmetric. Here we allow \ud835\udc00_0 to have zero eigenvalues so that the form (<ref>) can also cover parabolic equations such as the R13 equations. For problems with unbounded domains or periodic boundary conditions, one can show that\n\nd/dt \u222b^T \ud835\udc00_0  d= \u222b^T \ud835\udc0b  d\u2a7d0,\n\nindicating the L^2 stability. For problems on bounded domains, additional conditions on the boundary conditions are suggested in <cit.> to preserve the L^2 stability. Assume that n = (n_1, n_2, n_3)^T is the outer unit normal vector on the boundary point. The conditions are based on the following structures of the matrices \ud835\udc00_j:\n\n    \ud835\udc0f (n_1 \ud835\udc00_1 + n_2 \ud835\udc00_2 + n_3 \ud835\udc00_3) \ud835\udc0f^T = [    0 \ud835\udc00_oe; \ud835\udc00_eo    0 ],\n\nwhere \ud835\udc0f is an orthogonal matrix converting the moments  to another set of moments, each of which is either odd or even in the normal direction, and we choose the permutation such that\n\n\ud835\udc0f = [  _odd; _even ].\n\nThe moments in _odd include quantities that changes sign when the frame of reference changes by flipping the normal vector n, and the moments in _even remain unchanged under this transformation. By the symmetry of \ud835\udc00_j, we have \ud835\udc00_oe = \ud835\udc00_eo^T. The structure (<ref>) comes from the fact that the normal flux of an odd moment is an even moment, and the normal flux of an even moment is an odd moment. With this structure, if \ud835\udc00_oe has full row rank, the L^2 stable boundary conditions have the form\n\n    _odd = \ud835\udc10\ud835\udc00_oe (_even - g_ext),\n\nwhere \ud835\udc10 is a positive semidefinite matrix, g_ext refers to the external source coming from the boundary of the domain.\nSuch boundary conditions are known as Onsager boundary conditions.\nThe particular form of boundary conditions that has odd moments on the left-hand side originates from Grad's work <cit.>, which ensures the continuity of boundary conditions with respect to the accommodation coefficient. However, for a specific moment system, choosing _odd to be all the odd moments may result in a rank-deficient \ud835\udc00_oe, so that (<ref>) will provide too many boundary conditions. In this work, we will encounter such a situation during our derivation, requiring us to adjust the selections of _odd and _even to restore the surjective property of \ud835\udc00_oe.\nThe structure of Onsager boundary conditions is useful not only for time-dependent problems.\nFor steady-state problems (time derivative removed in (<ref>)), Onsager boundary conditions can provide a symmetric weak form, which helps develop the theory of well-posedness and the finite element methods <cit.>.\n\nFor the regularized 13-moment equations for Maxwell molecules, the boundary conditions with this particular structure have been devised in <cit.>. However, the technique to derive the Onsager boundary conditions cannot be directly generalized to the R13 equations for more general molecules. In this work, we will reconsider the derivation of the linearized steady-state R13 equations for general collision models, from which we will show clearly how the structure (<ref>) is built into the derivation of moment equations, and thus the boundary conditions in the form (<ref>) can be naturally obtained. \n\nIn the following section, we will review the moment method for the linear Boltzmann equation and the asymptotic expansions of the moments when the Knudsen number is small. Our main results are presented in Section <ref>, where the explicit forms of the linear R13 equations and the Onsager boundary conditions are provided. The derivation of the R13 equations and boundary conditions are respectively given in Section <ref> and <ref>. In Section <ref>, we verify the accuracy of our model by one-dimensional channel problems. A brief conclusion is given in Section <ref>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 REVIEW OF THE MOMENT EQUATIONS AND ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF MOMENTS\n\nWe consider the steady-state linear Boltzmann equation\n\n    \u03be_j \u2202 f/\u2202 x_j = 1/\u2112 [f]\n\nwhere f(,) is the distribution function, = (x_1,x_2,x_3) denotes the position and = (\u03be_1,\u03be_2,\u03be_3) stands for the velocity of the gas molecules. We apply Einstein's summation convention throughout this work, meaning that when an index appears twice in the same term, the expression represents the sum of this term with this index running from 1 to 3. For example, in (<ref>), \n    \u03be_j  \u2202 f/\u2202 x_j =\u03be_1  \u2202 f/\u2202 x_1 + \u03be_2  \u2202 f/\u2202 x_2 + \u03be_3  \u2202 f/\u2202 x_3.\n For indices whose ranges are not from 1 to 3, the summation symbol will be written explicitly. On the right-hand side of (<ref>), the constant  is the Knudsen number characterizing how rarefied the gas is, and \u2112 [f] is the linearized Boltzmann collision operator. Below we will introduce the general moment equations for the linearized Boltzmann equation and the asymptotic expansion of the moments in the case of a small Knudsen number.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Series expansion and moment equations\n\nFollowing <cit.>, we expand the distribution function into an infinite series:\n\n    f(,)= \u2211_l=0^+\u221e\u2211_m=0^+\u221e(2l+1)!!/l!w_i_1\u22ef i_l^m() \u03c8^m_i_1 \u22ef i_l().\n\nHere, the basis functions \u03c8_i_1\u22ef i_l^m are defined by\n\n    \u03c8^m_i_1,\u22ef,i_l()=1/(2\u03c0)^3/2L\u0305_m^(l+1/2)( ||^2/2)\u03be_\u27e8 i_1\u22ef\u03be_i_l \u27e9exp( -||^2/2),\n\nwhere \u03be_\u27e8 i_1\u22ef\u03be_i_l \u27e9 is the trace-free part of the tensor \u03be_ i_1\u22ef\u03be_i_l (see <cit.>), and L\u0305_n^(l+1/2) is the normalized Laguerre polynomial\n\n    L\u0305_n^(l+1/2)(x) = \u221a(\u221a(\u03c0)/2^l+1 n! \u0393(n+l+3/2)) x^-(l+1/2)( d/dx - 1 )^n x^n+l+1/2.\n\nIn literature, people usually define the Maxwellian\n    \n     f_M() = 1/(2\u03c0)^3/2 exp( -||^2/2 ),\n    \nso that \u03c8^m_i_1,\u22ef,i_l()=L\u0305_m^(l+1/2)(||^2/2) \u03be_\u27e8 i_1\u22ef\u03be_i_l \u27e9 f_M(). Compared with the classical series expansion by Grad <cit.>, the Maxwellian f_M is a global equilibrium state due to our linearized setting. This expansion requires us to assume that the distribution function is defined in the following Hilbert space:\n\nL^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1  d) := { f |\u222b_\u211d^3 [f()]^2/f_M()  d< +\u221e},\n\nso that all the moments of the distribution function can be properly defined. The inner product of this Hilbert space is\n\n   \u27e8g_1,g_2\u27e9:= \u222b_\u211d^3 g_1()g_2()/f_M() ,\n\nso that we can express the coefficients w_i_1\u22ef i_l^m as the moments of the distribution function:\n\n    w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n() = \u27e8 f, \u03c8^m_i_1\u22ef i_l\u27e9.\n\nIn particular, we would like to highlight the relationship between these coefficients and the quantities in Grad's 13-moment equations:\n\n    \u03c1 = w^0,    v_i = \u221a(3) w_i^0,   \u03b8 = -\u221a(2/3) w^1,   \u03c3_ij = \u221a(15) w_ij^0,    q_i = -\u221a(15/2) w_i^1,\n\nwhere \u03c1, v_i, \u03b8, \u03c3_ij and q_i denote the density, velocity, temperature, stress tensor and heat flux, respectively.\n\nDue to the rotational invariance of the collision, the linear operator \u2112 satisfies \n\n    \u2112[ \u03c8^n_i_1,\u22ef,i_l] = \u2211_m=0^+\u221e a_lmn\u03c8^m_i_1,\u22ef,i_l,\n\nwhere the coefficient a_lmn satisfies a_lmn = a_lnm for all nonnegative integers l,m and n, and\n\n    a_lmn = \u27e8\u03c8_i_1\u22ef i_l^m, \u2112\u03c8_i_1\u22ef i_l^n \u27e9/\u27e8\u03c8_i_1\u22ef i_l^m, \u03c8_i_1\u22ef i_l^m \u27e9.\n\nNote that we have chosen the basis functions such that \u27e8\u03c8_i_1\u22ef i_l^n, \u03c8_i_1\u22ef i_l^n \u27e9 depends only on i_1, \u22ef, i_l, leading to the symmetry of a_lmn.\nDue to the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, it holds that\n\n    a_00n = a_0n0 = a_01n = a_0n1 = a_10n = a_1n0 = 0.\n\nFor inverse-power-law models, these coefficients have been calculated in <cit.>, where it has also been pointed out that the collision operator \u2112 is usually an unbounded operator acting on a subset of L^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1 d).\n\nThe equations of the moments w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n can be obtained by taking the inner product of \u03c8_i_1\u22ef i_l^n and both sides of the Boltzmann equation (<ref>). The resulting moment equations are\n\n    T_i_1 \u22ef i_l^n =\n       1/\u2211_n'=0^+\u221e a_lnn' w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n'\n\nwhere \n\n    T_i_1\u22ef i_l^n:=    ( \u221a(2(n+l)+3)\u2202 w_i_1\u22ef i_l j^n/\u2202 x_j - \u221a(2n)\u2202 w_i_1\u22ef i_l j^n-1/\u2202 x_j)\n          +   l/2l+1( \u221a(2(n+l)+1)\u2202 w_\u27e8 i_1\u22ef i_l-1^n/\u2202 x_i_l \u27e9 - \u221a(2(n+1))\u2202 w_\u27e8 i_1\u22ef i_l-1^n+1/\u2202 x_i_l\u27e9).\n\nThe derivation of these equations will be briefly introduced in Section <ref> of the supplementary material.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Asymptotic expansion of moments\n\n\nAssuming that  is a small parameter, we consider the asymptotic expansions of w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n:\n\n    w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n =  w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n|0 +  w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n|1 + ^2 w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n|2 + ^3 w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n|3 + \u22ef.\n\nThe classical Chapman-Enskog expansion can be applied to express each term using the density, momentum, energy and their derivatives. Here, instead of performing the Chapman-Enskog expansion, we would like to find the orders of magnitude of each moment and the relationship between the terms in each order.\nTo this aim, we introduce the coefficients b_lnn'^(n_0) to denote the inverses of a_lmn, which satisfy\n\n    \u2211_n'=n_0^+\u221e a_lnn' b_ln_1 n'^(n_0) = \u03b4_nn_1.\n\nNote that the coefficients b_0nn'^(0), b_0nn'^(1) and b_1nn'^(0) do not exist due to (<ref>).\nBy asymptotic analysis, we are able to identify the magnitude of each moment w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n and find the linear dependency between w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n|k for different n's. This method is known as the order of magnitude approach <cit.>.\n\nBelow we list the moments by order up to O(^3) and some results of the linear relationship to be used later in this work. The derivation can be found in Section <ref> in the supplementary material.\n\n    \n  (O0) O(1) moments:  w^0, w^1, w^0_i.\n    \n  (O1) O() moments: {w^n_i}_n=1^\u221e, {w^n_ij}_n=0^\u221e. The leading order terms of these moments satisfy \n\n    w_i^n|1    = b_11n^(1)/b_111^(1) w_i^1|1\u00a0for\u00a0 n \u2a7e 1, \n    \n        w_ij^n|1    = b_20n^(0)/b_200^(0) w_ij^0|1\u00a0for\u00a0 n \u2a7e 0,\n    \nand the second order terms satisfy  \n\n    w_i^n|2    = \u03b3^(1),n_1/\u03b3^(1),2_1 w_i^2|2\u00a0for\u00a0 n \u2a7e 2   \u00a0with\u00a0\u03b3^(1),n_1 = \u2211_n'=2^\u221eb_1nn'^(2) (\u221a(2n'+5) b_20n'^(0) - \u221a(2n') b_20,n'-1^(0))/b_200^(0),\n     \n    \n     w_ij^n|2    = \u03b3^(1),n_2/\u03b3^(1),1_2 w_ij^1|2\u00a0for\u00a0 n \u2a7e 1   \u00a0with\u00a0\u03b3^(1),n_2 = 2/5\u2211_n'=1^\u221eb_2nn'^(1) (\u221a(2n'+5) b_11n'^(1) - \u221a(2(n'+1)) b_11,n'+1^(1))/b_111^(1).\n\n\n\n\n  (O2) O(^2) moments: {w^n}_n=2^\u221e, {w^n_ijk}_n=0^\u221e. Their leading order terms satisfy \n\n    w^n|2 =    \u03b3^(2),n_0/\u03b3^(2),2_0w^2|2\u00a0with\u00a0\u03b3^(2),n_0 =  \u2211_n'=2^+\u221eb_0nn'^(2) (\u221a(2n'+3) b_11n'^(1) - \u221a(2n') b_11,n'-1^(1))/b_111^(1),  \n        w_ijk^n|2 = \u03b3^(2),n_3/\u03b3^(2),0_3 w_ijk^0|2\u00a0with\u00a0\u03b3^(2),n_3 =  3/7\u2211_n'=0^+\u221eb_3nn'^(0)/b_200^(0)(\u221a(2n'+7) b_20n'^(0) - \u221a(2(n'+1)) b_20,n'+1^(0)) .\n\n\n  (O3) O(^3) moments: {w^n_ijkl}_n=0^\u221e.\n\n\n\n\n\n  (O4) o(^3) moments: all other w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n which are not listed above.\n\nThese results show that only the conserved moments are zeroth-order moments, which agrees with the results from the Chapman-Enskog expansion. Although there are infinite first-order moments, the leading-order terms depend only on the stress tensor (w_ij^0) and the heat flux (w_i^1). The purpose of R13 equations is to formulate equations using only these representative moments up to the first order, and \u201cregularization terms\u201d are added to increase its order of accuracy to cover super-Burnett equations. This requires us to express all second-order terms w_i_1\u22ef i_l^n|2 using the thirteen moments appearing in the equations, and such a procedure has been done in the literature <cit.>. However, the approach therein does not clearly show how the stable boundary conditions should be derived. Although attempts have been made to study boundary value problems in <cit.>, the boundary conditions do not have the structure (<ref>) as required in <cit.>. In this paper, we will re-derive the regularized 13-moment equations from another point of view, and equip the model with reasonable boundary conditions with the desired structure. Before that, we will first present our final models in the next section for the readers who are not interested in the derivation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 LINEAR R13 EQUATIONS AND ONSAGER BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\nIn this section, we present the steady-state linear regularized 13-moment equations for general gas molecules, and provide the Onsager boundary conditions satisfying the conditions in <cit.>.

We remark that for Maxwell molecules, \u03b2_1 above takes the form 0/0 and is thus not well-defined. In this case, \u03b2_1 is set to be 0. One can easily observe the symmetric structure of the system above, where the complicated second-order derivatives in the last two equations are on the diagonal. We have shown that such moment system has the super-Burnett order. \n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Onsager boundary conditions\n \nThe R13 equations are equipped with an Onsager-type boundary conditions which read \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    v_n =  0, \n       q_n =  2\u03c7/2-\u03c7[\u03bb_11(\u03b8 - \u03b8^W) + \u03bb_12\u03c3_nn + \u03bb_13\u2202 q_j/\u2202 x_j + \u03bb_14\u2202 q_\u27e8 n/\u2202 x_n \u27e9],\n       \u03c3_t_i n =   2\u03c7/2-\u03c7[ \u03bb_21 (v_t_i - v_t_i^W) + \u03bb_22q_t_i + \u03bb_23\u2202\u03c3_t_i j/\u2202 x_j + \u03bb_24\u2202\u03c3_\u27e8 nn/\u2202 x_t_i  \u27e9],    i =1,2,\n       \u2202 q_\u27e8 t_i/\u2202 x_n \u27e9 =  2\u03c7/2-\u03c7[ \u03bb_31 (v_t_i - v_t_i^W) + \u03bb_32q_t_i + \u03bb_33\u2202\u03c3_t_i j/\u2202 x_j + \u03bb_34\u2202\u03c3_\u27e8 nn/\u2202 x_t_i \u27e9],    i =1,2,\n       ( \u2202\u03c3_\u27e8 nn/\u2202 x_n \u27e9 + \u03bb_45\u2202\u03c3_ n t_j/\u2202 x_t_j)  \n        =   2\u03c7/2-\u03c7[ \u03bb_41(\u03b8 - \u03b8^W) + \u03bb_42\u03c3_nn + \u03bb_43\u2202 q_j/\u2202 x_j + \u03bb_44\u2202 q_\u27e8 n/\u2202 x_n \u27e9], \n       (\u2202\u03c3_\u27e8 t_it_i/\u2202 x_n \u27e9 + 1/2\u2202\u03c3_\u27e8 nn/\u2202 x_n \u27e9) =   2\u03c7/2-\u03c7(\u03bb_51\u03c3_t_it_i + \u03bb_52\u03c3_nn),   i =1,2,\n       \u2202\u03c3_\u27e8 t_1t_2/\u2202 x_n \u27e9 =  2\u03c7/2-\u03c7\u03bb_61\u03c3_t_1t_2.\n\nThe expressions of coefficient \u03bb_ij can be found in Section <ref> of the supplementary material. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DERIVATION OF R13 EQUATIONS\n\n\nWe will now present the derivation of the R13 equations given in Section <ref>. Our derivation will use a method different from previous papers <cit.>, so that it is clear why the structure (<ref>) exist in the final system.\nSince the derivation of moment equations often involves complicated notations and calculations, in order to better explain the main idea of our derivation, we will first write the equations using operators on function spaces instead of the moments (Section <ref>), and then explain how to convert the abstract form to the explicit moment equations (Section <ref>).\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Reformulation of the distribution function\n\n\nIn Section <ref>, we have seen that when using \u03c8_i_1 \u22ef i_l^m f_M as basis functions, there are infinite O(^d) coefficients for any d \u2265 1, which is inconvenient for the derivation of moment equations. In this section, we will look for new basis functions such that in the expansions, only finite coefficients have the order O(^k) for any k. In other words, we seek the following orthogonal decomposition of the function space:\n\nL^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1  d) = \ud835\udd4d^(0) \u2295\ud835\udd4d^(1) \u2295\ud835\udd4d^(2) \u2295\u22ef\nsuch that each \ud835\udd4d^(k) is a finite dimensional space, and it holds that\n\n    \ud835\udcab^(k) f \u223c O(^k),     \u2200 k \u2208\u2115,\n\nwhere \ud835\udcab^(k) is the projection operator from L^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1 d) onto \ud835\udd4d^(k). Such a decomposition allows us to consider the projection of f onto a finite dimensional space when we want to achieve a reduced model up to a given order of accuracy.\n\nFor the purpose of deriving R13 equations, we just need to use the function spaces from \ud835\udd4d^(0) to \ud835\udd4d^(3). They will be discussed in the following subsections.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The zeroth-order function space\n\nThe function space \ud835\udd4d^(0) can be easily observed from the Chapman-Enskog expansion. It should be spanned by the basis functions corresponding to the conserved moments, which means\n\n    \ud835\udd4d^(0) = span{\u03c8^0, \u03c8^1, \u03c8_i^0 | i = 1,2,3}.\n\nIt is clear that\n\n\ud835\udd4d^(0) = 5.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The first-order function space\n\nOur idea to find the first-order function space is to first construct the orthogonal complement of \ud835\udd4d^(0)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(1), and then find \ud835\udd4d^(1) by orthogonality. This orthogonal complement will include the part of f that has order higher than or equal to O(^2). According to (O2)-(O4) in Section <ref>, we know that all the following functions should be members of (\ud835\udd4d^(0)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(1))^\u22a5:\n\n    \u03c8^n  for  n \u2265 2,     \u03c8_i_1 \u22ef i_l^n  for all  l \u2265 3  and  n \u2265 0.\n\nIn addition, the relation (<ref>) yields\n\n    w_i^n - b_11n^(1)/b_111^(1) w_i^1 = \u27e8 f,  \u03c8_i^n - b_11n^(1)/b_111^(1)\u03c8_i^1\u27e9\u223c O(^2) \u00a0for\u00a0 n \u2265 2,\n\nmeaning that\n\n    \u03c8_i^n - b_11n^(1)/b_111^(1)\u03c8_i^1\u2208 (\ud835\udd4d^(0)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(1))^\u22a5,     \u2200 i = 1,2,3,    n \u2265 2.\n\nSimilarly, we can use (<ref>) to obtain\n\n    \u03c8_ij^n - b_20n^(0)/b_200^(0)\u03c8_ij^0\u2208 (\ud835\udd4d^(0)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(1))^\u22a5,     \u2200 i = 1,2,3,    n \u2265 1.\n\nWe can now conclude that (\ud835\udd4d^(0)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(1))^\u22a5 is the subspace of L^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1 d) spanned by all the functions in (<ref>)(<ref>)(<ref>). Consequently, we can find \ud835\udd4d^(1) in the form of\n\n    \ud835\udd4d^(1) = span{\u03d5_i^(1), \u03d5_ij^(1) |  i,j = 1,2,3 },\n\nwhere\n\n\u03d5_i^(1) = \u2211_n=1^+\u221e c_1^(1),n \u03c8_i^n,     \u03d5_ij^(1) = \u2211_n=0^+\u221e c_2^(1),n \u03c8_ij^n.\n\nThe coefficients c_1^(1),n and c_2^(1),n are determined by solving \n\n    \u27e8\u03c8_i^n - b_11n^(1)/b_111^(1)\u03c8_i^1,\u03d5_i^(1)\u27e9  =0   \u00a0and\u00a0  \u27e8\u03c8_ij^n - b_20n^(0)/b_200^(0)\u03c8_ij^0 ,\u03d5_ij^(1)\u27e9   =0\n\nrespectively, and are then scaled such that\n\n    \u2211_n=1^+\u221e|c_1^(1),n|^2 = \u2211_n=0^+\u221e|c_2^(1),n|^2 = 1.\n\nSince \u03c8_ij^n is a trace-free tensor, we have\n\n\ud835\udd4d^(1) = 8.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The second-order function space\n\nThe second-order function spaces can be found in a similar way. Using (O2)\u2013(O4), we notice that the following functions are members of (\ud835\udd4d^(0)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(1)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(2))^\u22a5:\n\n    \u03c8^n - \u03b3_n/\u03b3_2\u03c8^2  for  n \u2265 3,     ( \u03c8_i^n - b^(1)_11n/b^(1)_111\u03c8^1_i ) - \u03b3^(1),n_1/\u03b3^(1),2_1( \u03c8_i^2 - b^(1)_112/b^(1)_111\u03c8^1_i )  for  n \u2265 3, \n    ( \u03c8_ij^n - b^(0)_20n/b^(0)_200\u03c8^0_ij) - \u03b3^(1),n_2/\u03b3^(1),1_2( \u03c8_ij^1 - b^(0)_201/b^(0)_200\u03c8^0_ij)  for  n \u2265 2,     \u03c8_ijk^n - \u03b3^(2),n_3/\u03b3^(2),0_3\u03c8_ijk^0  for  n \u2265 1, \n    \u03c8_i_1\u22ef i_l^n  for all  l \u2265 4  and  n \u2265 0.\n\nLet (\ud835\udd4d^(0)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(1)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(2))^\u22a5 be the linear span of all these functions. We can find \ud835\udd4d^(2) in the following form:\n\n    \ud835\udd4d^(2) = span{\u03d5^(2), \u03d5_i^(2), \u03d5_ij^(2), \u03d5_ijk^(2) |  i,j,k = 1,2,3\n    },\n\nwhere\n\n    \u03d5^(2) = \u2211_n=2^+\u221e c_0^(2),n\u03c8^n,     \u03d5_i^(2) = \u2211_n=2^+\u221e c_1^(2),n(\u03c8_i^n - b^(1)_11n/b^(1)_111\u03c8^1_i), \n    \u03d5_ij^(2) = \u2211_n=1^+\u221e c_2^(2),n(\u03c8_ij^n - b^(0)_20n/b^(0)_200\u03c8^0_ij),     \u03d5_ijk^(2) = \u2211_n=0^+\u221e c_3^(2),n\u03c8_ijk^n.\n\nFor simplicity, we let\n\nc_1^(2),1 = -\u2211_n=2^+\u221e c_1^(2),n b_11n^(1)/b_111^(1),     c_2^(2),0 = -\u2211_n=1^+\u221e c_2^(2),n b_20n^(0)/b_200^(0),\n\nso that\n\n    \u03d5_i^(2) = \u2211_n=1^+\u221e c_1^(2),n\u03c8_i^n,     \u03d5_ij^(2) = \u2211_n=0^+\u221e c_2^(2),n\u03c8_ij^n.\n\nThese coefficients are again determined by the orthogonality similar to (<ref>) and then scaled similarly as (<ref>). The expressions of c^(1),n_l and c^(2),n_l can be found in Section <ref> of the supplementary material. Also, it is not difficult to find that\n\n\ud835\udd4d^(2) = 16.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 The third-order function space\n\nThe space \ud835\udd4d^(3) can again be derived using the same strategy. The result will have the form\n\n\ud835\udd4d^(3) = span {\n  \u03d5^(3), \u03d5_i^(3), \u03d5_ij^(3), \u03d5_ijk^(3), \u03d5_ijkl^(3)  |  i,j,k,l = 1,2,3\n},\n\nand\n\n\ud835\udd4d^(3) = 25.\n\nFor our purpose, the precise forms of these functions will not be used.\n\nFor Maxwell molecules, due to the special structure b_lnn'^n_0 = 0 for all n \u2260 n', the function space \ud835\udd4d^(2) will be slightly different. Instead of (<ref>), we will have\n\n\ud835\udd4d^(2) = span {\n  \u03d5^(2), \u03d5_ij^(2), \u03d5_ijk^(2)  |  i,j,k = 1,2,3\n},\n\nand thus \ud835\udd4d^(2) = 13. In fact, we also have \u03d5^(2) = \u03c8^2, \u03d5_ij^(2) = \u03c8_ij^1 and \u03d5_ijk^(2) = \u03c8_ijk, which can significantly simplify the derivation. In this paper, we will mainly focus on the R13 equations for general molecules. One can find the equations for Maxwell molecules in many references such as <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The abstract form of regularized 13-moment equations\n \nIn order to derive R13 moment equations that are accurate up to the super-Burnett order, it suffices to work only in the function space\n\n\ud835\udd4d := \ud835\udd4d^(0) \u2295\ud835\udd4d^(1) \u2295\ud835\udd4d^(2) \u2295\ud835\udd4d^(3).\n\nIn other words, we consider the following approximation of the Boltzmann equation (<ref>):\n\n\u2202/\u2202x_j (\ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d \u03be_j \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d f) = 1/ \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d \u2112\ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d f.\n\nHere \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d denotes the projection operator from L^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1 d) onto \ud835\udd4d. One can easily verify that both \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\u03be_j \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d and \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\u2112\ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d are self-adjoint operators.\n\nTo separate different orders in the distribution function f, we further write \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d f as\n\n\ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d f = f^(0) + f^(1) + f^(2) + f^(3),\n\nwhere f^(k) = \ud835\udcab^(k) f (see (<ref>)). Thus, the projected Boltzmann equation can be written in the following form:\n\n    \u2211_j=1^3 \u2202/\u2202 x_j(\n    [ \ud835\udc9c_j^(00) \ud835\udc9c_j^(01) \ud835\udc9c_j^(02) \ud835\udc9c_j^(03); \ud835\udc9c_j^(10) \ud835\udc9c_j^(11) \ud835\udc9c_j^(12) \ud835\udc9c_j^(13); \ud835\udc9c_j^(20) \ud835\udc9c_j^(21) \ud835\udc9c_j^(22) \ud835\udc9c_j^(23); \ud835\udc9c_j^(30) \ud835\udc9c_j^(31) \ud835\udc9c_j^(32) \ud835\udc9c_j^(33) ][ f^(0); f^(1); f^(2); f^(3) ]) = 1/[      0      0      0      0;      0 \u2112^(11) \u2112^(12) \u2112^(13);      0 \u2112^(21) \u2112^(22) \u2112^(23);      0 \u2112^(31) \u2112^(32) \u2112^(33) ][ f^(0); f^(1); f^(2); f^(3) ],\n\nwhere\n\n\ud835\udc9c_j^(kl) = \ud835\udcab^(k) \u03be_j \ud835\udcab^(l),     \u2112^(kl) = \ud835\udcab^(k) \u2112 \ud835\udcab^(l).\n\nNote that the zero operators on the right-hand side of (<ref>) comes from the conservation laws, and on the left-hand side, we have written the sum over j explicitly for clearness. The self-adjointness of \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\u03be_j \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d and \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\u2112\ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d implies that \ud835\udc9c_j^(kl) = [\ud835\udc9c_j^(lk)]^\u2020 and \u2112_j^(kl) = [\u2112_j^(lk)]^\u2020. For simplicity, below we will use the definition\n\n\ud835\udc9c^(kl) = \u2211_j=1^3 \u2202/\u2202x_j \ud835\udc9c_j^(kl),\n\nso that the equations (<ref>) become \n\n    \ud835\udc9cf = 1/\u2112f,\n\nwhere\n\n    \ud835\udc9c =\n    [ \ud835\udc9c^(00) \ud835\udc9c^(01) \ud835\udc9c^(02) \ud835\udc9c^(03); \ud835\udc9c^(10) \ud835\udc9c^(11) \ud835\udc9c^(12) \ud835\udc9c^(13); \ud835\udc9c^(20) \ud835\udc9c^(21) \ud835\udc9c^(22) \ud835\udc9c^(23); \ud835\udc9c^(30) \ud835\udc9c^(31) \ud835\udc9c^(32) \ud835\udc9c^(33) ],   \u2112 = \n    [      0      0      0      0;      0 \u2112^(11) \u2112^(12) \u2112^(13);      0 \u2112^(21) \u2112^(22) \u2112^(23);      0 \u2112^(31) \u2112^(32) \u2112^(33) ],   f = [ f^(0); f^(1); f^(2); f^(3) ].\n\n\nIn the rest part of this section, we will derive a simplified version of the equations (<ref>) in the following form:\n\n    [  \ud835\udc9c^(00)  \ud835\udc9c^(01)  \ud835\udc9c^(02);  \ud835\udc9c^(10)  \ud835\udc9c^(11)  \ud835\udc9c^(12);  \ud835\udc9c^(20)  \ud835\udc9c^(21) \ud835\udc9c\u0305^(22) ][ f^(0); f^(1); f^(2) ]\n    = 1/[      0      0      0;      0 \u2112^(11) \u2112^(12);      0 \u2112^(21) \u2112^(22);        ][ f^(0); f^(1); f^(2) ].\n\nWe require that the super-Burnett equations can also be derived from these equations. The abstract system (<ref>) will be further formulated as R13 equations in Section <ref>. To specify the operator \ud835\udc9c\u0305^(22) and clarify why the final equations hold the form (<ref>), we need three steps given in the three subsections below.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Step 1: Diagonalization of the right-hand side\n\nThe first step of our derivation is to reformulate (<ref>) into an equivalent form where the right-hand side contains only a diagonal matrix of operators. Such a form will make it easier for us to spot high-order terms that can be dropped in the final form of R13 equations. To this end, we define\n\n    \ud835\udcac = \n    [       \u2110       0       0       0;       0       \u2110       0       0;       0       0       \u2110       0;       0       0 -\u212c^(32)       \u2110 ][       \u2110       0       0       0;       0       \u2110       0       0;       0 -\u212c^(21)       \u2110       0;       0 -\u212c^(31)       0       \u2110 ],\n\nwhere\n\n    \u212c^(21) = \u2112^(21) [\u2112^(11)]^-1,     \u212c^(31) = \u2112^(31) [\u2112^(11)]^-1, \n    \u212c^(32) =[\u2112^(32) - \u212c^(31)\u2112^(12)][\u2112^(22) - \u212c^(21)\u2112^(12)]^-1.\n\nThis procedure is similar to Gaussian elimination of \u2112, and the invertibility of the operators in the definitions of \u212c^(kl) can be guaranteed by the fact that the linearized Boltzmann collision operator \u2112 is negative semidefinite with its nullspace being \ud835\udd4d^(0). Let \ud835\udcac^\u2020 be the adjoint transpose of the operator matrix \ud835\udcac. It can be seen that the matrix \ud835\udcac\u2112\ud835\udcac^\u2020 is diagonal.\n\nWe now apply this transformation to the projected Boltzmann equation (<ref>). By introducing f\u0303 = \ud835\udcac^-\u2020f, we can multiply both sides of (<ref>) by \ud835\udcac and write the result as\n\n    \ud835\udcac\ud835\udc9c\ud835\udcac^\u2020f\u0303 = 1/\ud835\udcac\u2112\ud835\udcac^\u2020f\u0303.\n\nWe claim that the operator matrices \ud835\udcac\ud835\udc9c\ud835\udcac^\u2020 and \ud835\udcac\u2112\ud835\udcac^\u2020 have the following structures:\n\n    \ud835\udcac\ud835\udc9c\ud835\udcac^\u2020 =[  \ud835\udc9c^(00)  \ud835\udc9c^(01)       0       0;  \ud835\udc9c^(10)  \ud835\udc9c^(11) \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(12)       0;       0 \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(21) \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(22) \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(23);       0       0 \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(32) \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(33) ],     \ud835\udcac\u2112\ud835\udcac^\u2020 =[       0       0       0       0;       0  \u2112^(11)       0       0;       0       0 \u2112\u0303^(22)       0;       0       0       0 \u2112\u0303^(33) ].\n\nThe diagonal structure of \ud835\udcac\u2112\ud835\udcac^\u2020 has been clarified in the construction of the matrix \ud835\udcac. To explain why \ud835\udcac\ud835\udc9c\ud835\udcac^\u2020 is tridiagonal, we need the following facts:\n\n\n  * By straightforward calculation, we have\n\nf\u0303 := [ f\u0303^(0); f\u0303^(1); f\u0303^(2); f\u0303^(3) ]\n= [                                                       f^(0); f^(1) + [\u212c^(21)]^\u2020 f^(2) + [\u212c^(31) + \u212c^(32) \u212c^(21)]^\u2020 f^(3);                                    f^(2) + [\u212c^(32)]^\u2020 f^(3);                                                       f^(3) ],\n\nwhich shows that the last two components of \ud835\udcac\u2112\ud835\udcac^\u2020f\u0303 have magnitudes O(^2) and O(^3), respectively.\n\n  * By (<ref>), the last two components of \ud835\udcac\ud835\udc9c\ud835\udcac^\u2020f\u0303 should have magnitudes O() and O(^2), respectively. Therefore, the three operators below the subdiagonal of \ud835\udcac\ud835\udc9c\ud835\udcac^\u2020 can only be zero operators.\n\n  * Due to the symmetric structure of \ud835\udcac\ud835\udc9c\ud835\udcac^\u2020, the three operators above its superdiagonal must also be zero operators.\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Step 2: Dropping high-order terms\n\nIn this step, our purpose is to drop as many terms in (<ref>) as possible while retaining the super-Burnett order of these equations. One possible approach to obtain super-Burnett equations is to perform the following Maxwell iteration based on (<ref>):\n\n    f\u0303_k+1^(1)   =  [\u2112^(11)]^-1( \ud835\udc9c^(10) f^(0) + \ud835\udc9c^(11)f\u0303_k^(1) + \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(12)f\u0303_k^(2)),    f\u0303^(1)_0    = 0, \n    f\u0303_k+1^(2)   =  [\u2112\u0303^(22)]^-1( \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(21) f_k^(1) + \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(22)f\u0303_k^(2) + \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(23)f\u0303_k^(3)),    f\u0303^(2)_0    = 0, \n    f\u0303_k+1^(3)   =  [\u2112\u0303^(33)]^-1( \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(32)f\u0303_k^(2) + \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(33)f\u0303_k^(3)),    f\u0303^(3)_0    = 0.\n\nNote that the local equilibrium f^(0) does not attend the iteration. The super-Burnett equations can be written as\n\n\ud835\udc9c^(00) f^(0) + \ud835\udc9c^(01) f\u0303^(1)_3 = 0,\n\nwhere f\u0303^(1)_3 is from the result of three Maxwell iterations. Straightforward calculation yields \n\n\nf\u0303^(1)_3\n   =[\u2112^(11)]^-1 \ud835\udc9c^(10) f^(0) + ^2 [\u2112^(11)]^-1 \ud835\udc9c^(11) [\u2112^(11)]^-1 \ud835\udc9c^(10) f^(0) \n\n       + ^3  ([\u2112^(11)]^-1  \ud835\udc9c^(11))^2 [\u2112^(11)]^-1 \ud835\udc9c^(10) f^(0) \n\n       + ^3 [\u2112^(11)]^-1 \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(12) [\u2112^(22)]^-1 \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(21) \n [\u2112^(11)]^-1 \ud835\udc9c^(10) f^(0).\n\n\nwhich has nothing to do with the operators \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(22), \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(23), \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(32) and \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(33). Therefore, we can set these four operators in (<ref>) to be zero and claim that the resulting equations\n\n    [  \ud835\udc9c^(00)  \ud835\udc9c^(01)       0       0;  \ud835\udc9c^(10)  \ud835\udc9c^(11) \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(12)       0;       0 \ud835\udc9c\u0303^(21)       0       0;       0       0       0       0 ][  f^(0); f\u0303^(1); f\u0303^(2);  f^(3) ] = 1/[       0       0       0       0;       0  \u2112^(11)       0       0;       0       0 \u2112\u0303^(22)       0;       0       0       0 \u2112\u0303^(33) ][  f^(0); f\u0303^(1); f\u0303^(2);  f^(3) ]\n\nstill have the super-Burnett order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Step 3: Applying the inverse transformation\n The equations (<ref>) already give us the abstract form of the R13 equations. However, due to the transformation introduced by \ud835\udcac, the left-hand sides of these equations no longer represent the approximation of \u03be_j \u2202_x_jf, and the right-hand sides no longer represent the approximation of \u2112f. Recovering such straightforward correspondence requires applying the inverse transformation \ud835\udcac^-1. By multiplying both sides of (<ref>) by \ud835\udcac^-1 and using f\u0303 = \ud835\udcac^-\u2020f, we obtain\n\n[  \ud835\udc9c^(00)  \ud835\udc9c^(01)  \ud835\udc9c^(02)  \ud835\udc9c^(03);  \ud835\udc9c^(10)  \ud835\udc9c^(11)  \ud835\udc9c^(12)  \ud835\udc9c^(13);  \ud835\udc9c^(20)  \ud835\udc9c^(21) \ud835\udc9c\u0305^(22) \ud835\udc9c\u0305^(23);  \ud835\udc9c^(30)  \ud835\udc9c^(31) \ud835\udc9c\u0305^(32) \ud835\udc9c\u0305^(33) ]\n[ f^(0); f^(1); f^(2); f^(3) ]\n= 1/ [      0      0      0      0;      0 \u2112^(11) \u2112^(12) \u2112^(13);      0 \u2112^(21) \u2112^(22) \u2112^(23);      0 \u2112^(31) \u2112^(32) \u2112^(33) ]\n[ f^(0); f^(1); f^(2); f^(3) ],\n\nwhere \n\n    \ud835\udc9c\u0305^(22) = \u212c^(21)\ud835\udc9c^(12) + \ud835\udc9c^(21) [\u212c^(21)]^\u2020 - \u212c^(21)\ud835\udc9c^(11)[\u212c^(21)]^\u2020,\n\nand the operators \ud835\udc9c\u0305^(23), \ud835\udc9c\u0305^(32) and \ud835\udc9c\u0305^(33) are unimportant since (<ref>) already shows f^(3) = 0. We can actually remove f^(3) completely from the system to get the final form (<ref>).\n\nSince f^(3) is no longer present in the final equations, they can be reformulated using a smaller function space\n\n    \ud835\udd4d := \ud835\udd4d^(0)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(1)\u2295\ud835\udd4d^(2).\n\nLet \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d be the projection operator onto \ud835\udd4d. The equations can then be written as\n\n\u2202/\u2202x_j (\ud835\udc9c\u0305_j f\u0305) = 1/ \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d \u2112 f\u0305,\n\nwhere f\u0305 is the unknown function in \ud835\udd4d, and\n\n    \ud835\udc9c\u0305_j = \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\u03be_j - (\ud835\udc9c_j^(22) - \u212c^(21)\ud835\udc9c_j^(12) - \ud835\udc9c_j^(21) [\u212c^(21)]^\u2020 + \u212c^(21)\ud835\udc9c_j^(11)[\u212c^(21)]^\u2020) \ud835\udcab^(2),\n\nwhich is an operator on \ud835\udd4d approximating the multiplication of a function by the velocity component \u03be_j.\nIt is straightforward to verify that \ud835\udc9c\u0305_j is a self-adjoint operator on \ud835\udd4d.\n\nSo far, we have obtained a linear system with desired symmetric structure, allowing us to further derive stable boundary conditions. This will be discussed in Section <ref>. In what follows, we will first provide the explicit forms of these equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Derivation of R13 moment equations\n\n\nWe will now derive the R13 equations presented in Section <ref>.\nAccording to definitions of the function spaces \ud835\udd4d^(0), \ud835\udd4d^(1) and \ud835\udd4d^(2) (see (<ref>)(<ref>)(<ref>)), we can express the projection f\u0305 := \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d f explicitly as\n\n    f\u0305 = w^0 \u03c8^0 + w^1 \u03c8^1 + 3w_i^0 \u03c8_i^0_zeroth order + 3u_i^(1)\u03d5_i^(1) + 15/2 u_ij^(1)\u03d5_ij^(1)_first order + u^(2)\u03d5^(2) + 3u_i^(2)\u03d5_i^(2) + 15/2u_ij^(2)\u03d5_ij^(2) + 35/2u_ijk^(2)\u03d5_ijk^(2)_second order.\n\nFor any f\u0305\u2208\ud835\udd4d with the above expression, we have\n\n    w^0 = \u27e8f\u0305 , \u03c8^(0)\u27e9,      w^1 = \u27e8f\u0305,\u03c8^(1)\u27e9,      w_i^0 = \u27e8f\u0305 , \u03c8_i^(0)\u27e9, \n    \n    u_i^(1) =  \u27e8f\u0305 , \u03d5^(1)_i\u27e9   ,      u_ij^(1) =  \u27e8f\u0305 , \u03d5^(1)_ij\u27e9  , \n    \n    u^(2) =   \u27e8f\u0305 , \u03d5^(2)\u27e9  ,      u^(2)_i =  \u27e8f\u0305 , \u03d5^(2)_i\u27e9,      u^(2)_ij =  \u27e8f\u0305 , \u03d5^(2)_ij\u27e9 ,       u^(2)_ijk = \u27e8f\u0305 , \u03d5^(2)_ijk\u27e9.\n\nOur purpose is to find the expressions of \u2202_x_j (\ud835\udc9c\u0305_j f\u0305) and \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\u2112f\u0305 under such representation.\n\nWe begin with the collision term \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\u2112f\u0305. Due to the conservation laws, the zeroth-order part of f\u0305 vanishes after applying \u2112. Using the rotational invariance of \u2112, we get\n\n    \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\u2112f\u0305 = \u2112_0^(22) u^(2)\u03d5^(2) + \u2211_m=1^2 \u2211_n=1^2 \u2112_1^(mn) u_i^(n)\u03d5_i^(m) + \u2211_m=1^2 \u2211_n=1^2 \u2112_2^(mn) u_ij^(n)\u03d5_ij^(m) + \u2112_3^(22) u_ijk^(2)\u03d5_ijk^(2),\n\nwhere \n\n    \u2112_l^(mn) = (2l+1)!!/l!\u27e8\u03d5_i_1\u22ef i_l^(m), \u2112\u03d5_i_1\u22ef i_l^(n)\u27e9/\u27e8\u03d5_i_1\u22ef i_l^(m), \u03d5_i_1\u22ef i_l^(m)\u27e9\n    \n    \n     =(2l+1)!!/l!\u2211_m',n' c^(m),m'_l c^(n),n'_l a_ln'm'\n\nThis value is independent of the choice of i_1, \u22ef, i_l due to the rotational invariance, and is symmetric with respect to the superscript (mn).

To get u_i^(2), we need to multiply (<ref>) by c_1^(2),1/c_1^(1),1 and subtract the result by (<ref>).

The linear system in Section <ref> can then be obtained by applying the relationship (<ref>).\n\nFor Maxwell molecules, due to the lack of three dimensions in \ud835\udd4d^(2), the variables  u^(2)_i do not exist. As a result, one needs to remove (<ref>) from the system. Also, the expression of \u03b2'_1 in (<ref>) becomes 0/0 for Maxwell molecules, and we need to set \u03b2'_1 to be zero to obtain correct equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DERIVATION OF ONSAGER BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR R13 EQUATIONS\n\n\nWe are now ready to derive wall boundary conditions for the R13 equations. In this work, we will focus on Maxwell's accommodation model <cit.>, which considers the interaction between gas molecules and the solid wall as a combination of specular reflection and diffusive reflection. In the derivation of boundary conditions for R13 equations, we will again write an abstract form using operators on function spaces to avoid lengthy formulas, and then convert it to its concrete form. Before starting our derivation, we will first briefly review Maxwell's boundary conditions for the linearized Boltzmann equation.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Maxwell's boundary condition\n\nConsider the boundary point at which the outer normal unit vector is n = (n_1, n_2, n_3)^T. For simplicity, we adopt the coordinate system with basis vectors n, t_1 and t_2 with t_1 and t_2 being two orthogonal tangent vectors. Thus, the distribution function can now be presented by f(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2), where \u03be_n = \u00b7n and \u03be_t_1 and \u03be_t_2 are similarly defined. For all other vectors and tensors, the indices will also be changed from 1,2,3 to n,t_1,t_2 in this section. Thus, the Boltzmann equation can be written as \n\n\u03be_n \u2202f/\u2202x_n +\n\u03be_t_1 \u2202f/\u2202x_t_1 +\n\u03be_t_2 \u2202f/\u2202x_t_2 = 1/\u2112f.\n\n\nFor hyperbolic equations, boundary conditions are needed only for incoming characteristics. Maxwell <cit.> proposed the following wall boundary condition for the distribution function:\n\n    f(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) = \u03c7 f_W(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) + (1-\u03c7) f(-\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2),     \u03be_n < 0,\n\nand \u03c7\u2208 [0,1] is the accommodation coefficient denoting the proportion of the diffusive reflection. Assume that the solid wall has temperature \u03b8^W and only moves in the tangential direction with velocity (0, v_t_1^W, v_t_2^W). Then the \u201cwall Maxwellian\u201d f_W() has the expression \n\n   f_W(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) = w^0,W \u03c8^0 + w^1,W \u03c8^1 + 3w_t_1^0,W \u03c8^0_t_1 + 3w_t_2^0,W \u03c8^0_t_2.\n\nHere w^1,W = -\u221a(3/2)\u03b8^W, w^0,W_t_i = \u221a(3)/3 v^W_t_i, and w^0,W are chosen such that\n\n    \u222b_\u211d^3\u03be_n f(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2)  d\u03be_n  d\u03be_t_1 d\u03be_t_2 = 0,\n\nmeaning that the normal mass flow is zero on the solid wall.\n\nTo derive boundary conditions for moment equations, it is more convenient to rewrite the (<ref>) in the following equivalent form:\n\n    f_odd(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) = \u03c7/2-\u03c7 [f_W(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) - f_even(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2)],     \u03be_n < 0,\n\nwhere f_odd and f_even refer to the odd and even parts of f:\n\n    f_odd(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2)    = f(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) - f(-\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2)/2, \n    \n    f_even(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2)    = f(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) + f(-\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2)/2.\n\nAlternatively, we can define f_odd and f_even by introducing the odd and even function spaces:\n\n    L_odd^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1 d)    = {f \u2208 L^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1 d) | f(-\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) = -f(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) }, \n    \n    L_even^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1 d)    = {f \u2208 L^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1 d) | f(-\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) = f(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) },\n\nand let\n\nf_odd = \ud835\udcab_odd f,     f_even = \ud835\udcab_even f.\n\nHere \ud835\udcab_odd and \ud835\udcab_even are projection operators onto the function spaces L_odd^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1 d) and L_even^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1 d), respectively. Thus, a more compact way to write down Maxwell's boundary condition (<ref>) is \n\n\ud835\udc9e \ud835\udcab_odd f = \u03c7/2-\u03c7 \ud835\udc9e(f_W - \ud835\udcab_even f),\n\nwhere \ud835\udc9e is half-space operator defined by\n\n    \ud835\udc9eg(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) = \n      g(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2),    if \u03be_n < 0, \n    \n      0,    if \u03be_n > 0.\n\nNoting that \ud835\udcab_odd = 2\ud835\udcab_odd\ud835\udc9e\ud835\udcab_odd, we can apply \ud835\udcab_odd to both sides of (<ref>) to get\n\n    \ud835\udcab_odd f = 2\u03c7/2-\u03c7\ud835\udcab_odd\ud835\udc9e(f_W - \ud835\udcab_even f).\n\nTo determine w^0,W in f_W, we need to use (<ref>), which can also be formulated as\n\n    \u27e8\u03c8_n^0, f \u27e9 = 0.\n\nThe complete Maxwell's boundary condition includes both (<ref>) and (<ref>).\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 A first attempt to formulate boundary conditions for R13 equations\n\nFollowing the formulation of Maxwell's boundary conditions (<ref>), we will also split the function space for R13 equations into an odd part and an even part:\n\n\ud835\udd4d = \ud835\udd4d_odd\u2295\ud835\udd4d_even,\n\nwhere\n\n\ud835\udd4d_odd = \ud835\udd4d \u2229L_odd^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1  d),     \ud835\udd4d_even = \ud835\udd4d \u2229L_even^2(\u211d^3, [f_M()]^-1  d).\n\nGrad's work <cit.> states that the boundary conditions of moment equations should be formulated by taking only odd moments of the kinetic boundary conditions. Therefore, we expect that the boundary conditions for R13 equations are written as a map from \ud835\udd4d_even to \ud835\udd4d_odd, which is analogous to (<ref>).\n\nFurthermore, to get Onsager boundary conditions satisfying the L^2 stability, we write the operator \ud835\udc9c\u0305_n = n_j \ud835\udc9c\u0305_j in the following form:\n\n    \ud835\udc9c\u0305_n = \ud835\udc9c\u0305_eo\ud835\udcab_odd|_\ud835\udd4d + \ud835\udc9c\u0305_oe\ud835\udcab_even|_\ud835\udd4d.\n\nHere \ud835\udcab_odd|_\ud835\udd4d and \ud835\udcab_even|_\ud835\udd4d are the restrictions of \ud835\udcab_odd and \ud835\udcab_even on \ud835\udd4d, respectively.\nSuch a form of \ud835\udc9c\u0305_n can be observed from the equations (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>), and it corresponds to the equation (<ref>) when written in the matrix form. The Onsager boundary conditions should hold the form\n\n    \ud835\udcab_odd|_\ud835\udd4d f\u0305 = \ud835\udcae\ud835\udc9c\u0305_oe(f_W - \ud835\udcab_even|_\ud835\udd4d f\u0305),\n\nwhere \ud835\udcae is a self-adjoint and negative semidefinite operator on \ud835\udd4d_odd. Note that (<ref>) is the operator form of the boundary conditions (<ref>). The operator \ud835\udcae can be figured out by comparing (<ref>) with (<ref>): since \ud835\udc9c\u0305_oe approximates the operation that multiplies an even function by \u03be_n, the operator \ud835\udcae should approximate the operator\n\n2\u03c7/2-\u03c7 \ud835\udcab_odd \ud835\udc9e \u03be_n^-1,\n\nso that (<ref>) can be regarded as a discretization of (<ref>). Thus, a natural choice is\n\n    \ud835\udcae = 2\u03c7/2-\u03c7\ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\ud835\udcab_odd\ud835\udc9e\u03be_n^-1.\n\nNote that \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\ud835\udcab_odd is the projection operator onto \ud835\udd4d_odd, and therefore \ud835\udcae is an operator on \ud835\udd4d_odd. The proposition below shows some desired properties of \ud835\udcae:\n\n\nThe operator \ud835\udcae is self-adjoint and negative semidefinite.\n\n\nFor any f\u0305_o,g\u0305_o\u2208\ud835\udd4d_odd, we have\n\n\n\u27e8f\u0305_o, \ud835\udcaeg\u0305_\u0305o\u0305 \u27e9   = 2\u03c7/2-\u03c7 \u27e8f\u0305_o, \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\ud835\udcab_odd \ud835\udc9e \u03be_n^-1 g\u0305_o\u27e9= \u27e8\ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\ud835\udcab_oddf\u0305_o, \ud835\udc9e \u03be_n^-1 g\u0305_o\u27e9= \u27e8f\u0305_o, \ud835\udc9e \u03be_n^-1 g\u0305_o\u27e9\n\n   = \u222b_-\u221e^0 \u222b_-\u221e^+\u221e \u222b_-\u221e^+\u221e f\u0305_o(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2) \u03be_n^-1 g\u0305_o(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2)  d \u03be_t_2  d \u03be_t_1  d \u03be_n \n\n   = \u27e8\ud835\udc9e \u03be_n^-1 f\u0305_o, g\u0305_o\u27e9= \u27e8\ud835\udc9e \u03be_n^-1 f\u0305_o, \ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\ud835\udcab_oddg\u0305_o\u27e9= \u27e8\ud835\udcab_\ud835\udd4d\ud835\udcab_odd \ud835\udc9e \u03be_n^-1 f\u0305_o, g\u0305_o\u27e9= \u27e8\ud835\udcae f\u0305_o, g\u0305_o \u27e9, \n\n\u27e8f\u0305_o, \ud835\udcaef\u0305_o \u27e9   = \u222b_-\u221e^0 \u222b_-\u221e^+\u221e \u222b_-\u221e^+\u221e \u03be_n^-1 [f\u0305_o(\u03be_n, \u03be_t_1, \u03be_t_2)]^2  d \u03be_t_2  d \u03be_t_1  d \u03be_n \u22640,\n\n\nwhich shows both properties of \ud835\udcae.\n\n\nThe equation (<ref>) with \ud835\udcae defined by (<ref>) is still incomplete since the condition for mass conservation (<ref>) has not been considered to determine w^0,W in the definition of f_W. Therefore, we further require that \u27e8\u03c8_n^0, f\u0305\u27e9 = 0, or equivalently,\n\n    \ud835\udcab_u f\u0305 = 0,\n\nwhere \ud835\udcab_u is the projection operator from \ud835\udd4d onto the following subspace:\n\n\ud835\udd4d_u = span { \u03c8_n^0 }.\n\nThe proposition below shows how we can combine (<ref>) and (<ref>) into one equation:\n\nLet \ud835\udcae_uu be a map from \ud835\udd4d_u to \ud835\udd4d_u defined by \ud835\udcae_uu = \ud835\udcab_u \ud835\udcae|_\ud835\udd4d_u. Then for any f\u0305 satisfying\n\n    \ud835\udcab_odd|_\ud835\udd4d f\u0305 = \ud835\udcae\u0305\ud835\udc9c\u0305_oe(f_W - \ud835\udcab_even|_\ud835\udd4d f\u0305)\n\nwith\n\n\ud835\udcae\u0305 = (\u2110 - \ud835\udcab_u) (\u2110 - \ud835\udcae \ud835\udcae_uu^-1 \ud835\udcab_u) \ud835\udcae,\n\nboth (<ref>) and (<ref>) hold for an appropriately chosen \u03c1_W. Meanwhile, the operator \ud835\udcae\u0305 is a self-adjoint and positive semidefinite operator on \ud835\udd4d_odd, and it satisfies\n\n    \ud835\udcae\u0305\ud835\udc9c\u0305_oe = \ud835\udcae\u0305\ud835\udc9c\u0305_oe (\u2110 - \ud835\udcab_\u03c1),\n\nwhere \ud835\udcab_\u03c1: \ud835\udd4d_even\u2192\ud835\udd4d_even is a projection operator defined by \ud835\udcab_\u03c1f\u0305_e = \u27e8f\u0305_e, \u03c8^0\u27e9\u03c8^0.\n\n\n\nThe rigorous proof of this proposition can be found in Section <ref> of supplementary material. This proposition shows that we can use (<ref>) as the Onsager boundary conditions for the R13 equations, and the property (<ref>) implies that \u03c1_W actually does not appear in (<ref>) since\n\n(\u2110 - \ud835\udcab_\u03c1) f_W = w^1,W \u03c8^1 + 3 w_t_1^0,W \u03c8_t_1^0 + 3 w_t_2^0,W \u03c8_t_2^0,\n\nwhich does not involve \u03c1_W. Following the abstract form (<ref>), we can write down the boundary conditions explicitly using the series expansion of the distribution functions. Since\n\n{ \u03c8_n^0, \u03d5_n^(1), \u03d5_nt_1^(1), \u03d5_nt_2^(1), \u03d5_n^(2), \u03d5_nt_1^(2), \u03d5_nt_2^(2), \u03d5_nnn^(2), \u03d5_nt_1 t_2^(2),  \u03d5_nt_1 t_1^(2) + 1/2 \u03d5_nnn^(2) }\n\nforms an orthogonal basis of \ud835\udd4d_odd (note that \u03d5_nt_2 t_2^(2) = -\u03d5_nnn^(2) - \u03d5_nt_1 t_1^(2)),\nten boundary conditions are to be prescribed for each boundary point. The calculation of the boundary conditions is tedious but straightforward. The results are \n\n    w_n^0    = 0, \n     u^(1)_n    = 2\u03c7/2-\u03c7[ \u03bb'_11 (w^1 -w^1,W) + \u03bb'_12 u^(1)_nn +  \u03bb'_13 u^(2) +  \u03bb'_14 u^(2)_nn], \n     u^(2)_n    = 2\u03c7/2-\u03c7[ \u03bb'_21 (w^1 -w^1,W) + \u03bb'_22u^(1)_nn +  \u03bb'_23 u^(2) +  \u03bb'_24 u^(2)_nn], \n       u^(1)_t_i n    = 2\u03c7/2-\u03c7[\u03bb'_31 (w^0_t_i -w^0,W_t_i) + \u03bb'_32u^(1)_t_i + \u03bb'_33 u^(2)_t_i  +  \u03bb'_34  u^(2)_t_i nn], \n      u^(2)_t_in    = 2\u03c7/2-\u03c7[ \u03bb'_41 (w^0_t_i -w^0,W_t_i) + \u03bb'_42u^(1)_t_i + \u03bb'_43 u^(2)_t_i + \u03bb'_44  u^(2)_t_i nn], \n      u^(2)_nnn    = 2\u03c7/2-\u03c7[\u03bb'_51 (w^1 -w^1,W) + \u03bb'_52u^(1)_nn +  \u03bb'_53 u^(2) +  \u03bb'_54 u^(2)_nn], \n     u^(2)_t_i t_i n + 1/2 u^(2)_nnn    =  2\u03c7/2-\u03c7[ \u03bb'_61(u^(1)_t_i t_i + c^(2),0_2/c^(1),0_2u^(2)_t_it_i) + \u03bb'_62(u^(1)_nn + c^(2),0_2/c^(1),0_2u^(2)_nn) ], \n      u^(2)_t_1 t_2 n    = 2\u03c7/2-\u03c7\u03bb'_71(u^(1)_t_1 t_2 + c^(2),0_2/c^(1),0_2u^(2)_t_1t_2).\n\nThe detailed derivation and the expressions of the coefficient \u03bb'_ij are given in Section <ref>.\n\n\nHowever, these equations give too many boundary conditions for the R13 equations. The general theory of hyperbolic conditions requires that the number of boundary conditions equal the number of negative eigenvalues of \ud835\udc9c\u0305_n. In our case, \ud835\udc9c\u0305_n has only 9 negative eigenvalues. In other words, the operator \ud835\udc9c\u0305_oe is not surjective.\nAs mentioned in Section <ref>, this is because our selection of function spaces \ud835\udd4d_odd and \ud835\udd4d_even are purely based on the symmetry of functions, regardless of the structure of equations. Detailed explanations and the fix of these boundary conditions will be shown in the next subsection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Fixing the boundary conditions\n\nTo show why \ud835\udc9c\u0305_oe is not surjective, we multiply the equation (<ref>) by c_1^(2),1/c_1^(1),1, subtract the result from (<ref>), and set the index i to be the normal direction n, yielding the equation\n\n\n(A_57 - c_1^(2),1/c_1^(1),1 A_45) [     \u2202/\u2202x_n (u_nn^(1) + c_2^(2),0/c_2^(1),0 u_nn^(2) ) + \u2202/\u2202x_t_1 (u_nt_1^(1) + c_2^(2),0/c_2^(1),0 u_nt_1^(2) ) \n\n    + \u2202/\u2202x_t_2 (u_nt_2^(1) + c_2^(2),0/c_2^(1),0 u_nt_2^(2) ) ] \n= 1/ (\u2112_1^(22) - c_1^(2),1/c_1^(1),1 \u2112_1^(12)) u_n^(2).\n\n\nThen we set i,j,k to be n in (<ref>): \n\n\n3/5 A_59 \u2202/\u2202x_n (u_nn^(1) + c_2^(2),0/c_2^(1),0 u_nn^(2) ) - 2/5 A_59 \u2202/\u2202x_t_1 (u_nt_1^(1) + c_2^(2),0/c_2^(1),0 u_nt_1^(2) ) - 2/5 A_59 \u2202/\u2202x_t_2 (u_nt_2^(1) + c_2^(2),0/c_2^(1),0 u_nt_2^(2) ) \n\n= 1/ \u2112_3^(22) u_nnn^(2).\n\n\nThe two equations above show that if we perform the linear combination\n\n3/5 A_59 \u00d7[(<ref>)|_i=n - c_1^(2),1/c_1^(1),1 \u00d7(<ref>)|_i=n ] - (A_57 - c_1^(2),1/c_1^(1),1 A_45 ) \u00d7(<ref>)|_i,j,k=n,\n\nthe derivatives with respect to x_n will all cancel out on the left-hand side. An equivalent statement is\n\n\u27e8\u03d5_0, \ud835\udc9c\u0305_oe f\u0305\n\u27e9= 0,     \u2200f\u0305 \u2208\ud835\udd4d,\n\nwhere\n\n    \u03d5_0 = 9/5 A_59(\u03d5_n^(2) - c_1^(2),1/c_1^(1),1\u03d5_n^(1)) - 35/2(A_57 - c_1^(2),1/c_1^(1),1 A_45) \u03d5_nnn^(2).\n\nLet \ud835\udd4d_0 = span{\u03d5_0} and \ud835\udcab_0 be the associated projection operator.

Therefore, such a fix is unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RESULTS OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL CHANNEL FLOWS\n\n \nCompared with the boundary conditions of R13 equations proposed in <cit.>, our boundary conditions have a nicer structure that agrees with the form (<ref>). However, it is unclear whether the acquirement of this structure will harm the accuracy of the model. In this section, we will reuse the examples for one-dimensional channel flows in <cit.> to test our models.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Problem settings and reduced moment equations\n\nWe consider the gas flow between two infinitely large parallel plates in steady state (see Figure <ref>). The distance between the two plates is L, and both plates are perpendicular to the x_2-axis. The temperatures of the left and right plates are respectively given by \u03b8_W^l and \u03b8_W^r. Both plates can move inside their own plane, and we choose the reference frame and the coordinates such that both velocities are parallel to the x_1-axis. Under such settings, all the moments are functions of x_2 only. Due to mass conservation, v_2=0. In addition, we have the symmetry f(\u03be_1,\u03be_2,\u03be_3) = f(\u03be_1,\u03be_2,-\u03be_3) since the plates only move along x_1, and thus all the moments that are odd in \u03be_3 vanish. In specific, we have \n\n    v_3 = q_3 = \u03c3_13 = \u03c3_23 = 0.\n\nFurthermore, since \u03c3_ij is trace-free, \u03c3_33 is automatically obtained once \u03c3_11 and \u03c3_22 are known. Therefore, the 13 moments in our problem can be reduced to eight variables including\n\n\n  * Equilibrium variables including density \u03c1, temperature \u03b8, and the velocity component parallel to the plates v_1;\n\n  * Components of the stress tensor including the parallel stress \u03c3_11, normal stress \u03c3_22 and the shear stress \u03c3_12;\n\n  * Heat fluxes including the parallel heat flux q_1 and the normal heat flux q_2.\n\n\n\n \nThe 13-moment equations (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) for the one-dimensional channel flows can be immediately obtained by dropping all partial derivatives with respective to x_1 and x_3. As a result, the conservation laws become\n\n    \u03c3_12/ x_2 = 0,     \u03c1/ x_2 +  \u03b8/ x_2 +  \u03c3_22/ x_2 = 0,      q_2/ x_2 = 0.\n\nThe equation of stress tensor \u03c3_11, \u03c3_22 and \u03c3_12 are \n\n    1/\u2112^(11)_2\u03c3_11 + 5 (c^(1),0_2)^2 \u03b2_4   q_2/ x_2 - c^(1),0_2/3\u03b2_3 ^2 \u03c3_11/ x^2_2 + c^(1),0_2/3(\u03b2_1 + 2/5\u03b2_3)  ^2 \u03c3_22/ x^2_2 = 0,\n    1/\u2112_2^(11)\u03c3_22 - 10 (c^(1),0_2)^2 \u03b2_4  q_2/ x_2-  c^(1),0_2 (2/3\u03b2_1 + 3/5\u03b2_3)  ^2 \u03c3_22/ x^2_2 = 0,\n    1/\u2112^(11)_2 \u03c3_12 - 15/2(c^(1),0_2)^2 v_1/ x_2 - 15/2 (c^(1),0_2)^2 \u03b2_4  q_1/ x_2-  c^(1),0_2 (1/2\u03b2_1 + 8/15\u03b2_3)  ^2 \u03c3_12/ x^2_2 = 0.\n\nThe equations of heat flux q_1 and q_2 are\n\n    1/\u2112^(11)_1 q_1 - 15/2 (c^(1),1_1)^2 \u03b2_4  \u03c3_12/ x_2 - c^(1),1_1/2\u03b2_2 ^2 q_1/ x^2_2 = 0,\n    1/\u2112^(11)_1 q_2 - 15/2 (c^(1),1_1)^2 \u03b2_4 \u03c3_22/ x_2 -  c^(1),1_1 (\u03b2_0  + 2/3\u03b2_2) ^2 q_2/ x^2_2 - 15/2(c^(1),1_1)^2 \u03b8/ x_2 = 0.\n\n\nThe general solution of this linear system can be found analytically. By the conservation laws, we see that \u03c3_12, \u03c1 + \u03b8 + \u03c3_22 and q_2 are all constants. Then we can solve q_1 and v_1 from (<ref>)(<ref>) and solve q_2 and \u03b8 from (<ref>)(<ref>).\nAfterwards, \u03c1 and \u03c3_11 can be immediately obtained by solving (<ref>) once other quantities are known. The general solution will include 11 constants to be determined. One of the constants depends on the average density between the plates: upon setting the range of x_2 to be [-1/2, 1/2] (so that L = 1), we assign the average density as  \n\n    \u222b_-1/2^1/2\u03c1(x_2)  dx_2 = 0.\n\nThe other 10 constants will be determined by 10 boundary conditions, of which each boundary has five given by (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) in the one-dimensional setting. Below we provide the boundary conditions on the right wall:\n\n    q_2 =     \u03c7_r/2 - \u03c7_r[ 2\u03bb_11 (\u03b8 - \u03b8^W_r) + 2\u03bb_12\u03c3_22 + (2\u03bb_13 + 4/3\u03bb_14)  q_2/ x_2], \n    \u03c3_12 =     \u03c7_r/2 - \u03c7_r[  2\u03bb_21(v_1 - v^W_r) + 2\u03bb_22 q_1 + (2\u03bb_23 + 16/15\u03bb_24 )\u03c3_12/ x_2],  \n     q_1/ x_2 =     \u03c7_r/2 - \u03c7_r[ 4\u03bb_31 (v_1 - v^W_r) + 4\u03bb_32q_1 + (4\u03bb_33 + 32/15\u03bb_34 )\u03c3_1 2 / x_2],  \n    \n         (\u03bb_45+ 3/5)\u03c3_22/ x_2 =     \u03c7_r/2 - \u03c7_r[ 2\u03bb_41 (\u03b8 - \u03b8^W_r) + 2\u03bb_42\u03c3_22 + (2\u03bb_43 + 4/3\u03bb_44)  q_2/ x_2], \n    (2 \u03c3_ 11/ x_2  +  \u03c3_ 22/ x_2 ) =     \u03c7_r/2-\u03c7_r(12\u03bb_51\u03c3_11 + 12\u03bb_52\u03c3_22).\n\nFor the boundary conditions on the left solid wall, one only needs to make the following replacement of parameters:\n\nq_2 \u2192-q_2,   \u03c3_12 \u2192-\u03c3_12,   x_2 \u2192-x_2,   \u03c7_r \u2192\u03c7_l,   \u03b8^W_r \u2192\u03b8^W_l,   v^W_r \u2192v^W_l.\n\nIn the next two subsections, two special cases will be considered to verify our model.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Results\n\nIn this section, we illustrate the analytic solutions of R13 equations (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) with the Onsager boundary conditions (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) using the examples of one-dimensional Couette and Fourier flows in <cit.>. The results will be compared with reference solutions by DSMC simulations which are obtained by Bird's code <cit.>.  \n\nFollowing the examples in <cit.>, we consider the inverse-power-law model which assumes that the force F between two molecules is proportional to an inverse power of the distance r between them as F = \u03ba r^-\u03b7, where \u03b7 and \u03ba are positive parameters. After nondimensionalization as done in <cit.>, the parameter \u03ba will be integrated into the Knudsen number , and we choose =0.05 and 0.1 in our tests. For the parameter \u03b7, we take three values \u03b7 =5,10 and \u221e. In particular, when \u03b7 =5, the inverse-power-law model becomes Maxwell molecules and the corresponding moment equations are identical to those derived in <cit.>; the choice \u03b7 = 10 is often used in the simulation of the argon gas; when \u03b7\u2192\u221e, the model reduces to the hard-sphere model <cit.>. Different choices of \u03b7 will result in different values of a_lmn in the collision operator (<ref>). Thus, the coefficients appearing in the moment equations such as \u2112^(mn)_l and \u03b2_i as well as \u03bb_ij in the boundary conditions all rely on the choice of \u03b7. We list the numerical values of these coefficients in the supplementary material for reference. In addition, both plates are assumed to be completely diffusive, that is, the accommodation coefficients are \u03c7_l = \u03c7_r =1. \n\nThe results are plotted in Figure <ref> and <ref> for the Couette flow and the Fourier flow. The horizontal axis in each subfigure is x_2, and the vertical axis is the value of the variables we are interested in for the one-dimensional channel problems with Knudsen numbers =0.05 and 0.1. The R13 results are plotted as the blue, yellow and green solid lines for \u03b7 =5,10 and \u221e, and the corresponding reference solutions by DSMC are given by the dotted lines with the same colors. Detailed descriptions of these figures are given in the following subsections.\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Results of the Couette flow\n\nIn the planar Couette flow, the two plates have the same temperature and move in opposite directions (see Figure <ref>). In our test, we select \u03b8_l^W = \u03b8_r^W = 0 and v_l^W = -v_r^W = 0.2. In Figure <ref>, we plot the results of v_1, \u03c3_12 and q_1 for Couette flow. As can be seen, the solid curves by R13 solutions generally agree with the dotted curves by the DSMC reference solutions, and they match better for smaller , which implies the validity of our models. Note that due to the lack of nonlinearity, the other five variables (\u03c1, \u03b8, \u03c3_11, \u03c3_22 and q_2) are all zero in the analytical solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u00a7.\u00a7.\u00a7 Results of the Fourier flow\n\nFor the Fourier flow, the two plates are stationary, i.e, v^W_r = v^W_l = 0, and the flow is driven solely by the difference of plate temperatures. In our simulations, we set \u03b8^W_l = 0 and \u03b8^W_r =0.2. Due to the simplicity of the structure, the Fourier flow relies less on the nonlinear contributions and we may look at some other variables that we have not shown in Figure <ref> for Couette flow. In Figure <ref>, we plot the results for \u03b8 , \u03c3_22 and q_2. Again, the R13 solutions (solid lines) provide qualitatively correct results as expected, showing that our linear R13 model works for the Fourier flow as well. In general, despite the enforcement of a symmetric structure, our models provide almost equal qualities as the equations in <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSION\n\n\nThis paper performs a re-derivation of the linear steady-state regularized 13-moment equations of general gas molecules from a novel point of view. Our derivation is based on a decomposition of the function space according to the order of accuracy, which provides a clearer picture of the entire procedure and gains a symmetric structure in the final system. This also allows a straightforward approach to obtaining Onsager boundary conditions. As an ongoing work, we are trying to apply this approach to time-dependent equations. Extensions to other kinetic equations such as the radiative transfer equation will also be considered in our future work.\n\n\n\n\n\nplain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary materials: Linear regularized 13-moment equations with Onsager boundary conditions for general gas molecules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DERIVATION OF MOMENT EQUATIONS (<REF>)\n\n\nGiven any tensors A^m_i_1\u22ef i_l for all l,m = 0,1,\u22ef, the basis functions \u03c8^m_i_1,\u22ef,i_l satisfy the following relation <cit.>:\n\n    \u2211_m,l=0^+\u221e A^m_i_1\u22ef i_l\u27e8  f_M \u03c8^m_i_1\u22ef i_l,\u03c8^n_j_1\u22ef j_l'\u27e9 =  l'!/(2l'+1)!!
