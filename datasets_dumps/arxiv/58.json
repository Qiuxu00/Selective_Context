We find strong evidence that the natural enhancement in the Hubble parameter at low redshifts is due to the underlying phantom nature of dark energy, rather than low matter density. As for the RSD data, we find a higher value of \u03c3^8_(0) which is consistent with CMB's predictions, but the outcome of low matter density leads to unresolved tension.

Sharma^1\n    March 30, 2023\n===============================================================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the wide recognition of the \u039bCDM  as a suitable model for describing the evolution of the universe, recent low-redshift observations have subjected it to intense scrutiny, particularly with respect to the identification of a high expansion rate and low matter-density clustering <cit.>. These estimates are found to be in a significant level of tension with the high-redshift Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) estimations on the \u039bCDM model <cit.>.\u00a0These low-redshift observations such as Supernovae H_0, for the Equation of State of DE (SH0ES) <cit.> and Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) <cit.> have challenged Planck-18 estimates for H_0 and \u03c3^8_0 by revealing discrepancies of about 4.4 \u03c3 and 3 \u03c3, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address these disagreements within a single framework, many different approaches have been put forward.\nThese approaches make use of interactions between dark energy and dark matter <cit.>, modifications of gravity at early <cit.> or late times <cit.>, and other related mechanisms <cit.>. However, \nin this letter, our main objective is to identify the fundamental cause(s) to which we can partially or fully attribute the existing problems. To do this, we adopt a model-independent technique that solely relies on \nthe data pertaining to the cosmological background and linear perturbative level to reconstruct the evolution of the universe.\nWe use a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics, wherein a fitness function evaluates the fitness of individuals in each step (or generation) \nand, as a result, the individuals from the population get selected to \nreproduce the offspring of the next generation <cit.>. Thus, individuals who can produce offspring with the highest fitness are identified in the population in an effort to emulate the process of natural selection. \n\nThe degree of effectiveness for each solution, which involves a single independent variable like redshift, is based on its ability to align with the observational data and achieve consistency. Our approach involves utilizing the Likelihood statistic as the fitness function to assess the \u201csuccess\u201d of reproducing species in each generation. The population which maximizes the  \nLikelihood is considered to have the highest fitness. Therefore, our stochastic process aims to maximize the Likelihood.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the accuracy of the final optimal solution is largely unaffected by changes in the initial population. Regardless of the initial conditions, the optimization process will generally lead to the same optimal solution, unless any singularities are encountered along the way. The main advantage of using this method is that it can automatically discover most relevant complex features from the data which may be beyond the capability of standard parametric methods.\n\nIn order to execute the algorithm mentioned, we utilize observational Hubble data (OHD) to analyze the background cosmological data, and redshift-space distortion (RSD) data to analyze the growth of matter density perturbations. The former gives us the insight of \nhow does the dominance of dark energy (DE) is affecting the rate of expansion of the universe for \na given cosmological model. Also it further enables \nus to figure out when does the universe transited from deceleration \nto acceleration. The latter tells us about the evolution of the large-scale structure of the universe. For better \nunderstanding of each dataset, we opt to conduct separate study instead of merging both \ndatasets. \n\nWe take the OHD data in the red-shift range \nz \u2208 [0.07, 1.965], and by defining the \u03c7^2 function, we execute the search-based algorithm, which utilises a population size that is sufficiently large, around \ud835\udcaa(10^3). Additionally, we generate different random numbers for each run to investigate whether the initial population has an impact on the outcome.\n\nWe have observed that the minimum \u03c7^2 value (corresponds to the maximum fitness) in our case has dropped to around 13.21 which for the \u039bCDM is around 14.5, this represents a significant improvement in the fit of almost 8.84%. This suggests a strong preference of some late-time gravitational modification over the \u039bCDM and various other models that mimics it. \n\n[Here we mention that while the best-fit \u03c7^2 for each run may vary slightly from other runs or require more generations to converge, it consistently yields an almost indistinguishable cosmological evolutionary scenario.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure (<ref>) demonstrates the 1\u03c3 evolutionary profile of the function H(z). While the Hubble parameter does follow the expected trend of decreasing with z, there is a noticeable deviation around a redshift of 0.2-0.4 where H(z) begins to shift towards higher values. This contradicts the prediction of various DE models, which suggest that the Hubble parameter will continue to decrease till it becomes almost constant in the far future. It is worth noting that if a particular constituent of the universe, which may be attributed to DE or a result of modified gravity, is intrinsically responsible for the enhancement in H(z) through a positive time-derivative, it would necessarily exhibit a phantom-like behavior <cit.>. \n\nAs is evident that the \nevolutionary profile of Hubble parameter in Fig. (<ref>) implies that the corresponding equation of state parameter, w__DE, must be super negative. \nIn order to quantitatively measure the effective DE contribution and its dynamics, let us compare it \nwith the standard flat-wCDM expression of the Hubble parameter:\n\n\n    \u210b(z) = H_0 \u221a(\u03a9_m^(0) (1+z)^3 + (1 - \u03a9_m^(0))  (1+z)^1+w__DE) ,\n\n\nwhere H_0 denotes the Hubble constant, and \u03a9_m^(0) represents the the current density parameter.  Assuming a flat universe with pressure-less dust, the total equation of state parameter w__T of the system is related to  w__DE as w__T=\u03a9__DE w__DE. Now, in order to statistically compare H(z) with \u210b(z), we consider H(z) to be the true function, and measure the square of the ratio of its difference with the \u210b(z), normalized by the 1\u03c3 uncertainty in the H(z). This way, one not only estimates the best-fit parameters but also their uncertainties from the uncertainties in H(z).\u00a0To carry out the analysis, we divide the range of redshift: z \u2208 [0,2] into bins of size 0.1, and use the Markov Chain process as a sampling technique. We obtain \n\n\n    H_0 = 73.02 \u00b1 1.2   [Km/s/Mpc],   \u03a9_m= 0.305 \u00b1 0.032, \n           w__DE = -1.339 \u00b1 0.175  ,\n\n\nwithin the 1\u03c3 level. It is worth noting that our estimation of H_0 aligns with the findings of SH0ES and other low-redshift observations such as the Megamaser Cosmology Project (MCP) <cit.>, H_0 Lenses in COSMOGRAIL's Wellspring (H0LiCOW) <cit.>. These observations measure H_0 = 73.9 \u00b1 3, and 73.3^+1.7_-1.8, respectively. Let us here note that it is the phantom behavior of dark energy which is clearly responsible for the increase in H_0 and the resolution of the Hubble tension, rather than the speculated under-density of matter at low-z. In fact, the increase in H_0 causes a 6.7% increase in total (local) matter density: \u03a9_m h^2, than what is  predicted by the Planck results. Furthermore, from w__DE estimates, it clearly shows >1 \u03c3 level discrepancy with the base \u039bCDM model. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn  what follows, we apply the same optimization algorithm to data related to matter perturbation i.e. redshift-space distortion (RSD).\nFor this dataset, we have used the compilation of \nf \u03c3^8(z) observations (f:= growth factor, and \u03c3^8 is the amplitude of power spectrum in 8h^-1Mpc) from different galaxy surveys in the redshift \nrange: z \u2208 [0.02,1.94] <cit.>. The main motivation for opting for this specific subset of data is its exceptional level of organization and lack of anomalies.  The \u03c7^2 for the \nsame is defined as: \u03c7^2 = V^i C_ij^-1V^j, where V \u2261 f \u03c3^8(z)- [f \u03c3^8(z)]_fit, and C_ij is the covariance matrix between different datasets. Just like the background analysis, here also we have conducted multiple simulations, all utilizing the same procedure as the one used for the cosmological background level. We have also verified for different \ninitial values to determine if there outcomes differ from one other.\n\n\n\nIn fig. (<ref>) we depict the evolutionary profile of f \u03c3^8(z), which corresponds to the maximum fitness up to the 1 \u03c3 level. Notably, the value of f \u03c3^8(0) is 0.381 \u00b1 0.012, which is significantly lower (a level >2 \u03c3) than the Planck result of 0.474 \u00b1 0.015. \n\nBy revisiting the flat-wCDM model to figure out what does fig. (<ref>) indicates in terms of the cosmological \nparameters which are associated with the growth of matter perturbations, such as, \n\u03a9_m^(0), \u03c3^8_(0) and w__DE. We again use the flat-wCDM model to analyze the analytical evolution of matter density contrast \u03b4_m, which is given as\n\n\n    \u03b4_m/a = \n     _2  F_1(w__DE-1/2w__DE,-1/3 w__DE;1-5/6 w__DE;\n     a^-3 w__DE(1-1/\u03a9_m^(0)))\n\n\nwhere a is the scale factor and _2  F_1 is the Hypergeometric function.\nUsing this one can determine the observable growth rate as\n\n\n    f \u03c3^8(z) = f(z) \u03c3^8_(0) \u03b4^(m)(z)/\u03b4^(m)(0) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere once again, we adopt the same approach to statistically compare f \u03c3^8(z) with Eq. (<ref>). The estimated values are given as follows [The obtained \u03c7^2 value is almost 6.7% better than that of the corresponding \u039bCDM model, and is also slightly better than that of the wCDM model.]:\n\n\n    w__DE = -1.065 \u00b1 0.103  ,   \u03a9_m^(0) = 0.261 \u00b1 0.014  \n         \n          \u03c3^8_(0) = 0.792 \u00b1 0.024  .\n\n\nHere also, we see that the equation of state for DE favours its phantom nature by leaning slightly towards lower values (<-1). On the other hand, the value of \u03c3^8_(0) is significantly higher than what was predicted by low-redshift observations such as KiDS-450 <cit.>. As already mentioned that the KiDS-450 estimate of \u03c3_8^(0) = 0.745 \u00b1 0.039 exhibits a tension of more than\n2 \u03c3 with Planck result: \u03c3^8_(0) = 0.811 \u00b1 0.006. Notably, \nour estimate on \u03c3_8^(0) does not show any tension with Planck's \u03c3_8^(0) result and is in \nagreement within 0.76  \u03c3 level. Since, the best-fit value of w__DE is very close to that of the \u039bCDM, the primary factor that plays the role in easing the tension of \u03c3^8_(0) is obtaining a \nlower value of \u03a9_m^(0) than what was estimated by Planck. It is nevertheless interesting to note that \nthe Planck's tension with RSD appears to be with the value of \u03a9_m^(0) rather than with the value of \u03c3^8_(0).\n\nFig. (<ref>) shows a comparison between the allowable parameter ranges obtained from the H(z) and RSD datasets to ensure compliance with both sets of estimations. The RSD dataset places stronger bounds on \u03a9_m^(0) and w__DE^(0) than H(z), while H(z) allows for the DE equation of state parameter to be more towards the phantom side compared to the RSD dataset. We find that the large negative DE equation of state for the background data and lower matter density parameter for the growth of perturbations are the main factors that can alleviate both tensions from their respective datasets. However, we also note that there is \nno common background parameter that can significantly reduce both tensions simultaneously, unless we introduce a separate mechanism which by introducing more parameters, will also affect the goodness of fit.\n\nBased on our RSD estimates, we observe that our \u03c3^8_(0) value is in closer agreement with the Planck results. To verify the consistency of our estimates in the standard \u03a9_m^(0)-\u03c3^8_(0) plane, which is commonly quantified by S^8_0 = \u03c3^8_0\u221a(\u03a9_m^(0)/0.3) <cit.>, we use the error propagation method. We find that S^8_0 = 0.738\u00b1 0.026, which is although compatible with low-redshift observations such as, KiDS-450 which gives S^8_0 = 0.745 \u00b1 0.039 displays a significant 3.4\u03c3 level tension with Planck's estimate of S^8_0 = 0.834 \u00b1 0.016. This tension is primarily due to the low estimated value of \u03a9_m^(0) which is linked to the low-phantom nature of DE as inferred from the RSD observations. If the DE equation of state were more phantom, similar to what we have obtained from the background estimation, it would require a high matter density parameter, which in turn would decrease the clustering amplitude. Therefore, unlike the H_0 tension, the S^8_0 tension cannot be resolved through standard cosmological parameters. It either indicates something fundamental in the evolution of cosmological perturbations or necessitates a careful cross-check of the systematic errors.\n\nNonetheless, our estimates have revealed the evolutionary profiles of f \u03c3^8(z) with H(z) across a range of redshifts from -0.2 to 1.5 in fig. (<ref>). We have depicted the evolution of linear perturbation with the background expansion by utilizing the Planck best-fits with \u03a9^(0)_m=0.315 and \u03c3^8_0 = 0.8111 in the plot. The figure demonstrates that both trajectories have evolved similarly in the past, but a change is observed at low-redshift, i.e., z<1. Particularly, the growth rate of matter perturbations, as per the Planck, achieves a maximum value significantly greater than our fit. After reaching the maximum value, the former shows a decreasing pattern with H(z). Nonetheless, due to the enhancement in H(z), f \u03c3^8(z) declines further than it would from the Planck results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe observation that the value of \u03a9_m^(0) derived from the Planck and RSD data exhibits a noteworthy level of inconsistency suggests that the tension is not solely associated with \u03c3^8_(0). Instead, our background estimates, as well as those from Planck, shows that \u03a9_m^(0)\u2243 0.3. As a result, the RSD dataset's distinctive low matter density parameter indicates that the tension could be attributed to systematics (atleast partially) rather than being largely impacted by the dark energy equation of state. We, therefore, emphasize that although the dark energy equation of state can alleviate the Hubble tension at the background level, it may not play a substantial role in resolving the S^8_0 tension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, we conducted two independent analyses to identify the reasons behind two tensions related to parameters H_0 and \u03c3^8_0. Our cosmological\u00a0model-agnostic findings demonstrate that the phantom nature of a weekly dynamical DE is required for the background, while a lower matter density parameter is necessary for the large amplitude of clustering of matter density perturbations. However, resolving one tension does not alleviate the other.\u00a0Our model-independent approach makes our results applicable in general. We show that it is possible to address the \u03c3^8_0 tension (i.e. making it compatible with the Planck results) by adopting a model that imitates \u039bCDM and proposes a low matter density parameter. On the other hand, in order to bring \u03c3^8_0 in agreement with the low-z observations by also having high \u03a9_m^(0), a purely phantom nature of DE is necessary. This suggests that while the phantom nature of DE plays a crucial role in satisfying the low-z observations at the background level, it is not the sole determining factor for reducing the \u03c3^8_0 tension by using RSD observations. If these discrepancies are not in systematics, solving these discrepancies requires a certain mechanism which on the background level largely affect the DE, whereas at the perturbative level, enhances the matter perturbations clustering amplitude. On theoretical grounds, the effective phantom-like behavior can be successfully realized \u00a0generically by the disformal coupling between baryonic and dark matter in the Einstein frame; this coupling does not require an additional degree of freedom. Another possibility is provided by the interaction between dark matter and dark energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\n\nThe work of MRG is supported by DST,\nGovernment of India under the Grant Agreement number\nIF18-PH-228 (Inspire Faculty Award).
