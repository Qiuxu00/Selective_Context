China\n\n\n\nTianwen-1 spacecraft <cit.> is China's first Mars exploration mission. The Mars Orbiter Magnetometer (MOMAG) is a scientific instrument aboard the Tianwen-1 mission that is designed to study magnetic fields at Mars, including the solar wind to the magnetosheath and the ionosphere. \nUsing the first Tianwen-1/MOMAG data that is publicly available, we present interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) and stream interaction region (SIR) catalogues based on in-situ observations at Mars between November 16, 2021, and December 31, 2021.\nWe compared the magnetic field intensity and vector magnetic field measurements from Tianwen-1/MOMAG and Mars Atmospheric Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)/MAG during the ICME and SIR interval and found a generally good consistency between them. \nDue to MAVEN's orbital adjustment since 2019, the Tianwen-1/MOMAG instrument is currently the almost unique interplanetary magnetic field monitor at Mars.\nThe observations indicate that the MOMAG instrument on Tianwen-1 is performing well and can provide accurate measurements of the vector magnetic field in the near-Mars solar wind space.\nThe multi-point observations combining MOMAG, MINPA, and MEPA on board Tianwen-1 with MAG, SWIA, and STATIC on board MAVEN will open a window to systematically study the characteristic of ICMEs and SIRs at Mars, and their influences on the Martian atmosphere and ionosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 INTRODUCTION\n\n\nCoronal mass ejections (CMEs) and Stream Interaction Regions (SIRs) are the two common large-scale disturbances in the heliosphere, driving extreme space weather in Earth's and planetary environment <cit.>. \nCMEs are large-scale eruptions of plasma and magnetic flux transferring huge energies from the lower solar corona into interplanetary space. \nInterplanetary CMEs (ICMEs), the interplanetary counterpart of CMEs, are the major cause of severe space weather, especially around the solar maximum <cit.>. \nSIRs are mainly created by the interaction between fast solar wind streams (emanating from coronal holes) and the low-speed streams arising in the streamer belt <cit.>. \nIf SIRs persist for more than one solar rotation, they can also be referred to as Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs, ).\nAt Earth, ICMEs can cause intense geomagnetic storms <cit.>, extensive ionospheric anomalies <cit.>, and disturbances in the atmosphere-ionosphere coupling system <cit.>, and trigger a wide array of undesirable consequences, including disruption in satellite systems, damage to the ground-based electric power grids, and interruptions of high-frequency communications and satellite navigation systems <cit.>.\nSIRs passing the Earth can cause recurrent geomagnetic storms <cit.>, change the energetic particle environment near Earth <cit.> and produce periodic oscillations in the ionosphere <cit.>.\n\nIn contrast to Earth, Mars lacks global intrinsic magnetic fields but possesses localized crustal fields <cit.>.\nThus, the ICMEs/SIRs carry the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and have direct access to the Martian atmosphere/ionosphere. \nMany previous studies used multiple spacecraft in-situ observations and numerical simulations to investigate the interaction between solar transient events and the Martian atmosphere.\nDuring the passage of the solar transient events (ICMEs), the solar wind interaction region was compressed <cit.>, and the cold ion escape of the Martian atmospheric rates increased <cit.>, which both indicate that the interaction between ICMEs and Mars is a significant factor in the evolution of the Martian atmosphere <cit.>. \nSIRs can cause strong perturbations in the martian-induced magnetosphere and ionosphere <cit.>. \nThe high energetic particles accelerated by shocks associated with ICMEs and SIRs can also cause an enhancement in the ionospheric ionization <cit.>. \nThe ICMEs/SIRs passing Mars can strongly affect the martian environment.\nStudying the in-situ characteristics of ICMEs/SIRs at Mars is critical for understanding the evolution of the Martian atmosphere and ionosphere. \n\nThe solar wind parameters near Mars have been continuously monitored by Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) since 2014, Mars Express (MEX) spacecraft since 2003, and Tianwen-1 since November 2021.\nTianwen-1 spacecraft <cit.> is China's first Mars exploration mission, launched on 23 July 2020, with a primary mission target of studying environment characteristics around Mars. \nThe Mars Orbiter Magnetometer (MOMAG) <cit.>, one of the orbiter's seven payloads, monitors the magnetic fields around Mars to learn more about its space environment and how it interacts with the solar wind.\nSince 16 November 2021, the MOMAG instrument on board the Tianwen-1 spacecraft has been continuously measuring the local magnetic field conditions around Mars, and its reliability has been verified by <cit.>.\nDespite the fact that MAVEN and Tianwen-1 are primarily planetary missions, both spacecraft repeatedly crossed the Martian magnetosphere and spent significant amounts of time in the solar wind, recording huge solar transient structures, such as ICMEs and SIRs.\nThe MAVEN spacecraft <cit.> was launched on 18 November 2013 and has investigated the interactions of the Sun and the solar wind with the Mars magnetosphere and upper atmosphere for 8 years.\nThe Magnetometer (MAG) <cit.> and the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) <cit.> on board MAVEN measure the intensity and direction of the magnetic field, density, temperature, bulk flow velocities, and dynamic pressure around Mars. \nInstruments on board the MAVEN and Tianwen-1 can simultaneously detect the arrival of ICMEs and SIRs.\nThe multi-point observations combining Tianwen-1 and  MAVEN provide an opportunity to systematically study the characteristic of ICMEs and SIRs, and their influences on the Martian atmosphere and ionosphere. \n\nIn this work, we use the Tianwen-1 and MAVEN in-situ observations to identify ICME and SIR events and give a detailed description of those five events. The layout of this paper is as follows. \nSection 2 briefly describes the in-situ magnetic field and solar wind plasma observations from the Tianwen-1 and MAVEN, and the criteria to identify ICMEs and SIRs used in this study. \nIn section 3, we present the first two ICMEs detected by the Tianwen-1 spacecraft and give a comparison of the magnetic field observations from Tianwen-1 and MAVEN during the two ICMEs.\nIn section 4, we present the first three SIRs detected by Tianwen-1 and the properties of SIRs near Mars. \nA summary of our main results and discussion are presented in the final section. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 DATASET AND CRITERIA\n\nFigure\u00a0<ref> presented the orbits of Mars, Venus, Mercury, STEREO-A, and Earth in Heliocentric Earth Ecliptic (HEE) coordinates from 16 November 2021 to 31 December 2022. \nThe orbital tracks are colour coded (from light to dark) to represent time (earlier to later).\nDuring that time, the Sun-centred longitudinal separation angles of Mars from Earth changed from \u223c159.3^\u2218 to 135.9^\u2218. \nIn this study, we adopt the interplanetary magnetic field vector data from MOMAG on board Tianwen-1 and MAG on board MAVEN, and the solar wind plasma data from MAVEN/SWIA. \nAll the data used in this paper are shown in the Mars Solar Orbital (MSO) coordinate system, with the x-axis pointing from Mars to the Sun, the z-axis aligned with Mars' rotation axis, and the y-axis completing the system.\n\nMAVEN orbits Mars in a \u223c4.5 hours orbit, while Tianwen-1 orbits Mars in a 7.8 hours orbit.\nFigure\u00a0<ref> shows the orbit of Tianwen-1 and MAVEN in the period of 16-18 November 2021.\nTianwen-1 orbits Mars in a steeply inclined elliptical plane with a periapsis of around 1.08 Mars radii (RM) and an apoapsis of about 4.17 RM (red lines in Figure 2).\nAccording to Tianwen-1's orbit, the MOMAG spends around 50%\u201375% of its time in the solar wind, detecting the magnetic field in the solar wind on the dawn-dusk side.\nMAVEN's orbit plane has a 75 inclination, with a periapsis between 150 and 200 km (1.04-1.06 RM) and an apoapsis between 5,900 and 6,000 km (2.74-2.77 RM) (blue lines in Figure 2).\nIt is apparent that the duration's of MOMAG magnetic field data and MAVEN/MAG magnetic field data in the solar wind are different.\nThus, considering the differences in Tianwen-1 and MAVEN orbits, the observations from MAVEN are complementary to those measured from Tianwen-1.\nThe combination of solar wind measurements from Tianwen-1 and MAVEN in-situ observations will be extremely useful in understanding the characteristics of ICMEs and SIRs at Mars.\n\nThe MAVEN spacecraft and Tianwen-1 spacecraft frequently cross the bow shock.\nThe selection criteria for MAVEN's undisturbed solar wind periods are based on the observations of the solar wind speed |v|> 200 km/s, normalized magnetic field fluctuation levels \u03c3B/|B|< 0.15, altitude R > 500km, and \u221a(()T/|v|) <0.012 <cit.>.\nWe define the sudden increase in magnetic field intensity as the Tianwen-1 spacecraft crossing the bow shock <cit.>.\nFor each orbit, the time Tianwen-1 entered the solar wind from the magnetic sheath and the time the solar wind entered the magnetic sheath can be easily confirmed. The period between the two passes was chosen as Tianwen-1's solar wind period <cit.>.\n\nAlthough the signatures of ICMEs can vary significantly, they still can be distinguished from the surrounding solar wind by a particular magnetic field and solar wind plasma signatures.\nThe criteria used to identify ICMEs on Mars are similar to those on Earth <cit.>:\n1) higher magnetic-field strength compared to its surroundings,\n2) reasonably monotonic, smooth rotating magnetic field direction, \n3) abnormally lower proton temperature, \n4) decreasing plasma velocity,\n5) lower plasma beta (\u03b2).\nPlease be aware that none of these signatures can be observed in all ICMEs.\nA structure is recognized as an ICME when it fits at least three of five criteria.\nA special type of ICMEs that satisfy the aforementioned 5 criteria are also called Magnetic Clouds (MCs) <cit.>.\n<cit.> identified 24 ICMEs using MAVEN/MAG and SWIA data from 2014 December 6 to 2019 February 21 and presented statistical characteristics of ICMEs at Mars with an average magnetic field strength of 5.99 nT, the density of 5.27 cm^-3, the velocity of 394.7 km s^-1, the dynamic pressure of 1.34 nPa. \n\nThe increasing velocity profile and the significantly enhanced total perpendicular pressure are critical criteria in determining the boundaries of SIR <cit.>. The compressed and enhanced magnetic field, the increased proton density and temperature are other important criteria to identify SIRs.  \n<cit.> identified 126 SIRs from 2014 October to 2018 November at Mars, and discovered that the average length of SIRs is around 37.0 h, the mean velocity is 430 km s^1, and the mean maximum magnetic field intensity is 11 nT at 1.5 AU.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ICME EVENTS\n \n\nBased on the criteria mentioned in Section 2 and the observations from Tianwen-1/MOMAG and Maven/MAG, we identified 2 ICME events from 16 November to 31 December 2021.\nFigure\u00a0<ref> (a\u2013f) shows the total magnetic field intensity (B), the elevation (\u03b8) and azimuthal \u03d5  angles of magnetic field direction in the MSO coordinate system, three components of the magnetic field in the MSO coordinate system (B_x, B_y, and B_z) from MAVEN/MAG (black asterisks) and Tianwen-1/MOMAG (red asterisks). \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>, the Tianwen-1/MOMAG magnetic data are comparable with MAVEN/MAG data.\nPanels (g-k) show the solar wind speed, plasma density, total dynamic pressure, proton temperature, and plasma beta from MAVEN/SWIA. \nWe only used the plasma and magnetic field data points in the undisturbed solar wind, whose selected criteria are introduced in Section 2.\n\n\nAs indicated by the purple shadow region in Figure\u00a0<ref>, an obvious ICME (ICME-1) was detected near Mars from 00:00UT on 10 December to 14:10UT on 11 December lasting about 38hr. \nThe ICME's front boundary is well determined, as the directional discontinuity in the elevation angle \u03b8 , B_x, B_y, and B_z magnetic field components (panels b, d-f). \nThe trailing boundary of the ICME is determined by the sharp enhancement in the plasma density and dynamic pressure (panels h and i).\nThe structure exhibits characteristics of a typical ICME including enhanced magnetic field strength, monotonous, smooth changing magnetic field vector, decreasing velocity, lower plasma density and lower plasma beta. \n\n\n\nAccording to the MAVEN solar wind selection criteria <cit.>, no undisturbed solar wind data were measured from MAVEN from 06:09 UT to 19:50 UT on December 10, 2021 (indicated by black lines). \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0<ref> (j), the plasma temperature during that time is significantly higher than the background solar wind, which might influence the selection of undisturbed solar wind.\nThus, for this region, we only use the first 4 of 5 criteria (the solar wind speed |v|> 200 km/s, normalized magnetic field fluctuation levels \u03c3B/|B|< 0.15, altitude R > 500km) to select the undisturbed solar wind.\nThe signal of Tianwen-1 across the bow shock is also not noticeable in MOMAG observations during that time. \nThe possible reason is that the arrival of ICME can dramatically alter the overall morphology of the Martian bow shock <cit.>. \n\nAccording to Tianwen-1/MAG and MAVEN/MOMAG observations, ICME-1 has a stronger magnetic field intensity (panel a) than the surrounding solar wind.\nThe average magnetic field strengths of detected from Tianwen-1/MAG and MAVEN/MOMAG are 7.29 nT and 6.74 nT, respectively. \nIn panel (b), the magnetic field elevation angles (\u03b8) from MAG and MOMAG both show distinct rotation from -90 to 90.\nThe magnetic field vectors B_x, B_y, and B_z, as shown in panels (d-f), from Tianwen-1/MOMAG and MAVEN/MAG are rotating simultaneously.\nAccording to the rotation of the magnetic field, ICME-1 also can be identified as an SWN-type MC.\n\n\nFigure\u00a0<ref> indicates that Tianwen-1/MOMAG is performing well and\nthe magnetic field observations from Tianwen-1/MOMAG and MAVEN/MAG can complement each other.\nCompared with the typical ICME parameters at Mars studied by <cit.>, ICME-1 has a higher magnetic field intensity (7.02 nT), a higher velocity (438.88 kms^-1), a lower plasma density (1.82 cm^-3), and comparable dynamic pressure (0.57 nPa). \nThose parameters indicate that ICME-1 is corresponding with a strong CME event. \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure\u00a0<ref> shows the second ICME (ICME-2) detected by Tianwen-1 and MAVEN spacecraft. An ICME (shown as the purple shadow) lasted about 44h from 00:00 UT on 29 December 2021 to 20:00 UT on 30 December 2021. \nDuring this period, the interplanetary observations show obvious ICME signatures with enhanced magnetic field strength, smoothly rotated magnetic field vector, decreasing velocity, low proton temperature, and lower plasma beta.\nThe data from Tianwen-1/MOMAG in the interval of CME-2 reveal comparable magnetic field strength and vector with MAVEN/MAG in panels (d-f).\nDuring the ICME-2 interval, MAVEN is only in the undisturbed solar wind for a short time, as shown in panels (d-f). \nThe Tianwen-1/MOMAG data are crucial for identifying the ICME-2 boundary and displaying the magnetic field direction rotation.\nICME-2 has a higher magnetic field intensity (6.33 nT), a lower velocity (335.55 kms^-1), a lower plasma density (6.37 cm^-3), and comparable dynamic pressure (1.20 nPa), compared with the typical ICME parameters at Mars studied by <cit.>. \nThe mean values of the two ICMEs' parameters are shown in Table\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\ncccc|cccccc\nThe begin and end time of CMEs detected by Tianwen spacecraft at Mars \n\n\n2*No.    2*Shock Time    Begin Time     End Time    6cMean Values in the Ejecta\n\n                 of the Ejecta     of the Ejecta      B       B_s     V_sw     T_p     N_p     P_dp\n\n    (UT)     (UT)     (UT)     (nT)     (nT)     (km/s)     (10^5K)      (cm^-3)     nPa \n1     \u2014\u2014      2021-12-10T00:00     2021-12-11T14:10     7.02     4.99     438.88     13.59     1.82     0.57\n\n2     \u2014\u2014      2021-12-29T00:00     2021-12-30T20:00     6.33     1.67     335.55     7.03       \n    6.37     1.20 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 SIR EVENTS\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the SIRs' criteria, we identified 3 SIR events from 16 November to 31 December 2021. The SIR catalogue and mean parameters of the SIR are shown in table 2. \n\nDuring 18-19 November 2021, a SIR event (SIR-1) was recorded by the Tianwen-1 and Maven spacecraft as illustrated in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\nThe purple shade region in the figure shows the beginning and end times of the SIR. \nFrom 18 November 13:00UT to 19 November 13:00UT, SIR-1 lasts about 24 hours, which is shorter than the average duration of SIRs at Mars <cit.>.\nDuring this period, the SIR-1 shows a compressed magnetic field, compressed proton number density, increased temperature, and continuously increased solar wind speed. \nNo clear forward or reverse shocks associated with SIR-1 are observed.\nThe maximum magnetic field of SIR-1 is 9.5 nT. The velocity of the SIR increased from \u223c390 km/s to 518.53 km/s, with an average value of 415.04 km/s. \nThe simultaneous decrease in proton density and increase in proton temperature can be used to identify a stream interface.\nThe blue vertical line in figure\u00a0<ref> shows the time of stream interface at 03:40 UT on November 19, which was also identified by <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFrom 16 December to 18 December 2021, the Tianwen-1 and Maven spacecraft detected another SIR event (SIR-3). \nThe two events (SIR-1 and SIR-3) are separated by an interval of 27.7 days, approximately corresponding to one solar rotation.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>, the purple shade region indicates the interval of the SIR. \nThe interval of the SIR lasts only 23hr, much less than the typical duration of SIRs at Mars <cit.>.\nA clear forward shock is characterised by simultaneous sharp increases in magnetic field intensity, bulk velocity, proton density and dynamic pressure at 06:00UT on December 16, 2021.  \nThe velocity in the interval of SIR-3 increased from about 300 kms^-1 to 545 kms^-1, with an average value of 446.9 kms^-1.\nThe maximum magnetic field of SIR-3 was detected by MAVEN/MAG at 9.5 nT and Tianwen-1/MOMAG at 8.8 nT, which is a little less than the average magnetic field of SIR obtained by <cit.>. \nThe average magnetic field intensity of SIR-3 is 4.95 nT.\nThe maximum and mean density of SIR-3 are 20 cm^-3 and 6.01 cm^-3, respectively. \nDue to a lack of continuous plasma data in the solar wind, it is hard to identify the stream interface of SIR-3. \nThe blue vertical line in figure\u00a0<ref> indicates a possible stream interface for SIR-3, with increased proton temperature and decreased proton density at 19:50 UT on December 16.\nComparing the parameters in SIR-1 and SIR-3, the average parameters in the two SIRs are comparable. It indicates that these two fast solar wind streams are from the same coronal hole and are observed in two adjacent solar rotations. \n\n\n\n\n\ncccc|cccccc\nThe begin and end time of SIRs detected by

of SIR-2 detected by Tianwen-1 and MAVEN spacecraft.\nA pair of forward\u2013reverse shocks bounding SIR-2 are observed at about 11:00UT on December 2 and 19:30UT on December 3, respectively.\nThe forward shock is identified by the simultaneous increase in the magnetic field, bulb velocity, proton density, and dynamic pressure. \nThe characteristics of reverse shock are a sharp increase in bulk velocity, a decrease in the magnetic field, proton density, and dynamic pressure.  \nIt should be noted that only approximately 4% of SIRs are associated with the forward\u2013reverse shock pair <cit.> at Mars.\nThe SIR-2 last about 32.5 hr, which is comparable to the average duration of SIRs on Mars.\nThe velocity of SIR-2 increased from \u223c300 km/s to 581.02 km/s, with an average value of 428.47 km/s.\nThe mean magnetic field of SIR-2 is 9.06 nT, showing a significant enhancement over the surrounding solar wind.\n\n\nIf the SIR rotates following the solar rotation, one more SIR should be detected by Tianwen-1 and Maven 27 days after SIR-2.\nWe surveyed the in-situ observations from Tianwen-1 and MAVEN in the period of 28-31 December 2021.\nOnly one typical ICME was recorded during that time, as shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>.\nAfter the interval of ICME-2, a clear increase in bulk velocity and temperature, and a decrease in proton density and pressure are shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>. \nIt indicates that the structure would be composed of a SIR and an ICME or complex ejecta.\nFigure\u00a0<ref> shows the position of Mars, Venus, Mercury, Earth and STA. \nWe will research the evolution of SIRs from 1 AU to 1.52 AU and predict the arrival time of SIRs <cit.> in the future by combining in-situ observations from the Wind spacecraft close to Earth and the STA spacecraft with the SIR catalogue <cit.>. \n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nThe Tianwen-1 mission is China's first Mars exploration mission.\nThe MOMAG on Tianwen-1 can make high-quality measurements of vector magnetic field in near-Mars space.\nThe magnetic field data between November 16 and December 31 2021 from MOMAG are released to the public recently.\nWe present ICME and SIR catalogues using the first available magnetic field measures from Tianwen-1/MOMAG, as well as the observations from MAVEN/MAG and SWIA.\n\nThe magnetic field observations from MOMAG and MAG provide a unique opportunity to jointly measure and compare the vector magnetic field in the interval of ICMEs and SIRs.\nAs we presented in the paper, the total magnetic field intensity, the elevation (\u03b8) and azimuthal (\u03d5) component of magnetic field direction and the three components of the magnetic field (B_x, B_y, and B_z) in the MSO coordinate measured by Tianwen-1/MOMAG are comparable to the observations from MAVEN/MAG. \nGiven that MAVEN altered its orbit and shortened its time in the solar wind, the Tianwen-1/MOMAG data is currently the almost unique interplanetary magnetic field monitor at Mars.\nWe are looking forward to further studies of ICMEs and SIRs near Mars using the multiple observations from Tianwen-1 and MAVEN.\nThose observations can advance our understanding of the characteristics of SIRs and ICMEs near Mars.\n\nFuture, the multipoint observations combining BepiColombo, STEREO, Wind, SOHO, Tianwen-1, and Maven would provide a unique opportunity to address the origin and propagation of ICMEs from the solar surface to 1.52 AU. \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0<ref>, during that time, these spacecraft have the chance to be in alignment (conjunction), which will help us to address some of the unresolved issues of CME evolution in the heliosphere.\nIt also provides a chance to investigate the evolution of SIR basic properties and related shock from 1AU to 1.52AU, when combined with measurements from Wind or STEREO-A at 1AU.\nThe arrival of ICMEs and SIRs can disrupt the entire Martian upper atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system and have a significant impact on the instantaneous rates of ion loss in the Martian atmosphere <cit.>.\nThe Mars Ion and Neutral Particle Analyzer (MINPA) <cit.> and the Mars Energetic Particles Analyzer (MEPA) <cit.> on board Tianwen-1 can detect low energy ions, neutral particles, electron, proton, alpha-particle and heavy ions in the space plasma environment of Mars.\nThe observations from MOMAG, MINPA, and MEPA on board the Tianwen-1 spacecraft will show the response of the Martian upper atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system to the ICMEs or SIRs.\n\n\n\n\nAll Tianwen-1 magnetic field data are
