First, we perform an average over the\n  fast angle of libration which provides an integrable approximation\n  of the Hamiltonian. Then, we introduce action-angle variables\n  that are adapted to such an integrable approximation. This sequence\n  of preliminary operations brings the Hamiltonian in a suitable form\n  to successfully start the Kolmogorov normalization scheme.

Nowadays more than 800\n  multiple-planet extrasolar systems have been discovered, making the\n  question even more relevant.\n\n  Typically, these systems have been numerically investigated as a\n  sort of inverse problem, prescribing their stability in order\n  to determine ranges of possible values of a few orbital elements\n  which are unknown or poorly known (e.g., inclinations and longitudes\n  of the nodes).  The numerical investigations of the dynamical\n  behavior of many interesting extrasolar planetary systems have been\n  done complementing long-term integrations (see,\n  e.g.,\u00a0<cit.> and\u00a0<cit.>) with\n  refined numerical techniques, like for instance the frequency\n  analysis method or the MEGNO chaos indicator (see,\n  e.g.,\u00a0<cit.> and\u00a0<cit.>,\n  respectively).\n\n\nPerturbation theory allows to complement the numerical investigations\nwith rigorous analytic results.  Normal form methods have a\nlong-standing tradition and their applications to problems that are\nrelevant in Celestial Mechanics have grown more and more with the\ndevelopment of the algebraic manipulators (for an introduction to the\nmain concepts of this kind of software see,\ne.g.,\u00a0<cit.>). Therefore, in such a framework the\nstudy of extrasolar planetary systems (in particular, of their secular\ndynamics) started very soon (see, e.g.,\u00a0<cit.>).  The\nanalytic investigation via computer algebra complements the knowledge\nprovided by long-term numerical integrations.  In particular, we think\nthat the modern Hamiltonian perturbation theory gives a proper\nframework, where it is possible to naturally explain why a\n  planetary configuration is stable and answer this question also\nwith quantitative arguments. In this respect, such a goal of the\nnormal form approaches is somehow reminiscent of the aims of other\nrecent works about the planetary system dynamics, which are not\nlimited just to detection of chaos, but they succeed in\nexplaining which is the source of instability in terms of\nsuperposition of a few resonances that are properly determined\n(see\u00a0<cit.>).\n\nAccording to the main results for quasi-integrable systems that have\nbeen obtained in the last decades, effective stability[A\n  dynamical system is said to be effectively stable when the\n  time needed to eventually escape from a small region of the phase\n  space is proved to largely exceed the expected life-time of such a\n  system.] is ensured in the vicinity of an invariant torus by\n  applying the KAM theorem jointly with the Birkhoff normal form and,\n  eventually, the Nekhoroshev theorem (see\u00a0<cit.> for a\n  complete discussion of this strategy, while applications to\n  planetary dynamical models are described in\u00a0<cit.>\n  and\u00a0<cit.>).\n\nIn turn, the construction of the invariant torus\n  through Kolmogorov normal form is more effective if the starting\n  Hamiltonian is close to a suitable normal form designed to locate\n  another invariant object. For instance,\n  a preliminar (partial) construction of the Birkhoff normal form\n  allows one to prove the existence of invariant tori which are in the\n  neighborhood of a stable equilibrium point and are well\n  approximating the orbits of celestial objects for both the secular dynamics of the\n  Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system and the Trojan asteroids\n  (see\u00a0<cit.> and\u00a0<cit.>, respectively).\n  In the former case, the equilibrium solution corresponds to orbits\n  which are both circular and coplanar in the approximation provided\n  by the average over the fast angles (up to order two in the masses)\n  of the planetary three-body model; such an approach has been used to\n  study the inverse problem concerning the stability of a few\n  extrasolar systems in the framework we have sketched above\n  (see\u00a0<cit.>). In the latter case, the stationary\n  solution is represented by one of the equilateral Lagrangian points,\n  that are commonly denoted with L_4, L_5; moreover, here it\n  has been necessary to preliminarly perform also the construction of\n  an intermediate invariant torus well approximating each sought\n  torus, by using a variant of the Kolmogorov normalization algorithm\n  that avoids small translations on the actions at every step of such\n  a computational procedure (which is detailed in\n  Section\u00a0<ref>).  In all these works, the rate of convergence\n  of the normalization algorithm is as faster as the final invariant\n  torus is closer to the equilibrium solution, this distance being\n  proportional to the norm of the actions, which are properly defined\n  with respect to action-angle canonical coordinates that are\n  preliminarly introduced in a suitable way. Therefore, these examples\n  highlight that there are regions of the phase space which are\n  dynamically stable because they are surrounding KAM tori that, in\n  turn, are persistent to perturbations due to their vicinity to\n  an elliptic equilibrium point.\n\nA strategy that is similar to the previous one (except for some further\nrefinement) has made possible to fully develop an application of the\nKAM theory to the secular dynamics of a three-body model of the\n\u03c5\u00a0Andromed\u00e6 planetary system\n(see\u00a0<cit.>). For that problem, first the normal form for\nan elliptic torus has been constructed. Afterwards, an intermediate\ninvariant torus is constructed by performing the already mentioned\nvariant of the Kolmogorov algorithm designed so as to skip the small\ntranslations at each normalization step (as it is described in\nSection\u00a0<ref>). Finally, the classical Kolmogorov algorithm is\nproved to converge to the normal form corresponding to the desired\ntorus. This result can be explained as follows: the secular dynamics\nof the three main bodies of the \u03c5\u00a0Andromed\u00e6 planetary\nsystem is stable because it is strictly winding around a linearly\nstable periodic orbit (i.e., a one-dimensional elliptic torus).  The\ndistance from the elliptic torus to the orbit under consideration\n(which is measured with respect to the value of a suitable action\ncoordinate) has been translated in an easy-to-use numerical\ncriterion evaluating the robustness of planetary configurations.  Such\na numerical indicator has been successfully applied to the study of\nthe inverse problem concerning the stability of the\n\u03c5\u00a0Andromed\u00e6 planetary system\n(see\u00a0<cit.>). This kind of numerical exploration\nlooks to be very suitable for applications to several (similar)\nexoplanetary systems and it is subject of some works in progress.[M.\u00a0Volpi,\n  U.\u00a0Locatelli, C.Caracciolo, M.\u00a0Sansottera. In preparation.] \n\nAs far as we know, an application of KAM theory to\n  realistic models of planetary systems in Mean Motion Resonance\n(hereafter often replaced with its acronym MMR) is still lacking;\nfilling this gap is the main motivation of the present work. Let us\nrecall that a non-negligible fraction of the multiple-planet\nextrasolar systems which have been recently discovered are expected to\nbe in MMR (see \u201cThe Extrasolar Planet Encyclopedia\u201d, http://exoplanet.eu). A few of them are hosting exoplanets that\nmove on rather eccentric orbits; usually they have been detected by\nusing the Radial Velocity method. We focus our attention on the two\nexoplanets orbiting around the HD60532 star. We consider their orbital\ndynamics in the framework of the same planar model already considered\nin\u00a0<cit.> and\u00a0<cit.>, where the existence of\nquasi-periodic stable motions is shown by applying the methods of\nfrequency analysis and a basic normal form approach jointly with\nnumerical integrations, respectively. In both the papers we have just\nmentioned, the model is unambiguously shown to be locked in a 3:1\nMMR, which is double in the sense that there are two independent\ncombinations of angles (including the mean anomalies) which are in a\nlibration regime. After having performed an average over a fast\nrevolution angle and the reduction of the angular momentum, the\nproblem is described by a two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian. Since\nthe orbits of those exoplanets are rather far from being circular, we\nthink that it is not appropriate to limit us to an approach based on\nexpansions up to the second order in the eccentricities (as it has\nbeen successfully done, with different purposes, in\u00a0<cit.>\nand \u00a0<cit.>). Therefore, in the present work we study an\nHamiltonian model which is defined by suitable expansions in the\ncanonical coordinates up to a larger order in the eccentricities\n(i.e.,\u00a06; see Section\u00a0<ref> for the proper definitions of\nthese rather standard expansions). At the end of this paper, in\nSection\u00a0<ref> we prove the existence of an invariant KAM torus\ncarrying quasi-periodic motions which are consistent with the orbits\ngenerated by the numerical integrations starting with initial\nconditions compatible with the observations. This result of ours is\nfully rigorous in the sense that it is completely demonstrated by\nusing a computer-assisted proof, based on a normal\n  form approach (for an introduction to this method see, e.g., the\n  Appendixes of\u00a0<cit.>). Let us recall that this is not\n  the only viable technique in this context; in particular, a careful\n  application of the so called a posteriori approach has been\n  able to prove the existence of KAM tori for values of the small\n  parameter \u03f5 extremely close to the breakdown threshold in\n  the famous case of the standard map[So\n      remarkable performances are also due to the fact that the\n      a posteriori method tries to determine just the\n      parameterization of the invariant torus, whose existence proof is\n      aimed at. Therefore, this approach takes profit of the fact that\n      the dimension of the problem is reduced, because the equivalent\n      of Taylor expansions with respect to the actions in the phase\n      space is not considered (see\u00a0<cit.> for a\n      description of this computer-assisted technique).] (see\n  <cit.>). In the framework of the computer-assisted\n  approach we work with, we emphasize that the preliminary\n  approximation of the Kolmogorov normal form is fundamental for the\n  eventual success of the application of KAM theory.  Indeed, the\nconvergence to the final sought KAM torus strongly depends on the\naccuracy given by the intermediate normal forms. We emphasize that\nnone of the strategies we have previously sketched (even if they are\nused in junction each other) is sufficient to perform the preliminary\noperations in such a way to allow the final constructive algorithm to\nbe convergent.  Therefore, in\nSections\u00a0<ref>\u2013<ref> we need to\ncarefully describe that part of our approach that is new and so\ncrucial. We stress that the intermediate Hamiltonian acting as a\nkeystone for our approach is provided by a further average with\nrespect to one of the librational angles; this is done so as to\nproduce an integrable approximation of the final Kolmogorov normal\nform, after having performed some further (and suitable) canonical\ntransformations. Let us also recall that an integrable model for the\ndynamics of planetary systems in MMR has been derived in another way\nin\u00a0<cit.> and it is used for a different analysis with\nrespect to ours.\n\nWe do believe that the whole computational procedure we describe in\nthe present paper can apply also to extrasolar planetary systems that\nare similar to the one orbiting around HD60532. Nevertheless, the\ndiscussion of the generality of the approach goes beyond our scope\nand it is deferred to future investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RESONANT HAMILTONIAN MODEL AT ORDER ONE IN THE MASSES\n\n\n\nWe consider a planar planetary three-body problem, consisting of a\ncentral star having mass m_0 and two coplanar planets having masses\nm_1 and m_2. The problem has 6 degrees of freedom, which can be\nreduced to 4 due to the conservation of the linear momentum.\nIntroducing the canonical astrocentric variables\n  (\ud835\udc2b\u0303_1 , \ud835\udc2b\u0303_2 , \ud835\udc2b_1 , \ud835\udc2b_2),\n  \ud835\udc2b_j being the coordinates and \ud835\udc2b\u0303_j the\n  conjugate momenta, the Hamiltonian reads\n\n    H(\ud835\udc2b\u0303,\ud835\udc2b)=T^(0)(\ud835\udc2b\u0303)+U^(0)(\ud835\udc2b)+T^(1)(\ud835\udc2b\u0303)+U^(1)(\ud835\udc2b)  ,\n\nwhere\n\n    T^(0)(\ud835\udc2b\u0303)=1/2\u2211_j=1^2\ud835\udc2b\u0303_j^2\n      (1/m_0+1/m_j) ,\n         U^(0)(\ud835\udc2b)   =-\u2211_j=1^2m_0 m_j/\ud835\udc2b_j ,\n      \n        T^(1)(\ud835\udc2b\u0303)=\ud835\udc2b\u0303_1 \u00b7\ud835\udc2b\u0303_2/m_0 ,\n         U^(1)(\ud835\udc2b)   =-m_1 m_2/\ud835\udc2b_1-\ud835\udc2b_2\n\nand  is the gravitational constant (see,\ne.g.,\u00a0<cit.>).  It is convenient to introduce the\nPoincar\u00e9 canonical variables\n\n    \u039b_j    = m_0 m_j/m_0+m_j\u221a( (m_0 + m_j) a_j) ,\n           \u03bb_j   =M_j + \u03c9_j ,\n    \u03be_j   =\u221a(2\u039b_j)\u221a(1-\u221a(1-e_j^2))cos(\u03c9_j) ,\n         \u03b7_j   = -\u221a(2\u039b_j)\u221a(1-\u221a(1-e_j^2))sin(\u03c9_j) ,\n\nwhere a_j, e_j, M_j and \u03c9_j are the semi-major axis, the\neccentricity, the mean anomaly and the argument of the pericenter of\nthe j-th planet, respectively.  In addition, we also introduce the\ntranslations L_j=\u039b_j-\u039b_j^* where \u039b_j^* is\ndefined taking into account the corresponding value a_j^* of the\nsemi-axis which is compatible with the observations.  Expanding the\nHamiltonian in Taylor-Fourier series around the origin of the\nvariables (L,\u03be,\u03b7), we get\n\n    1#   #   #\n     H(L,\u03bb,\u03be,\u03b7)   =K(L)+\u03bc P(L,\u03bb,\u03be,\u03b7)   =n^*\u00b7L+\u2211_j_1=2^\u221eh_j_1,0^(Kep)( L)+\u03bc\u2211_j_1=0^\u221e\u2211_j_2=0^\u221eh_j_1,j_2^(P)(L,\u03bb,\u03be,\u03b7) ,\n\nwhere n_j^*=\u221a((m_0+m_j)/(a_j^*)^3), for j=1,2, and\n\u03bc=max{m_1/m_0,m_2/m_0 }. The action-angle variables (\nL,\u03bb) are referred to as the fast variables and the cartesian\nvariables (\u03be,\u03b7) as the secular ones.  In particular,\nthe functions h_j_1,0^(Kep) of the Keplerian part K(L)\nare homogeneous polynomials of degree j_1 in the actions L,\nwhile the terms h_j_1,j_2^(P) of the perturbation\nP(L,\u03bb,\u03be,\u03b7) are homogeneous\npolynomials of degree j_1 in L, degree j_2 in\nthe secular variables (\u03be,\u03b7) and trigonometric\npolynomials in the angles \u03bb.\n\nOf course, in practical applications a finite truncation of the\nHamiltonian above is in order. The truncation rules adopted in the present work will be detailed in the\nfollowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 THE CASE STUDY OF THE HD60532 EXTRA-SOLAR SYSTEM\n\n\n\n\nLet us focus on the planar three-body problem for the HD60532\nextra-solar system.  The orbital parameters and the initial conditions\nare fixed as in Table\u00a0<ref>, according to the values\ngiven in\u00a0<cit.>.  This\nsystem consists of two giant planets in a 3:1 MMR, orbiting around\nthe star named HD60532.  The motion is assumed to be co-planar with an\ninclination i (with respect to the plane that is normal to the line\nof sight) which is fixed at 20^\u2218.  As a consequence, the initial\nmasses of the planets are increased by the factor 1/sin(i) with\nrespect to the minimum ones detected by means of the radial velocity\nmethod.  The presence of the mean motion resonance is confirmed by the\nevolution of the resonant angle \u03bb_1-3\u03bb_2+2\u03c9_1,\nwhich librates around 180^\u2218.  Moreover, the system also exhibits\na second libration angle given by the difference of the arguments of\nthe pericenters \u03c9_2-\u03c9_1, as it has been remarked\nin\u00a0<cit.>. Therefore, also the\naverage of \u03bb\u0307_1-3\u03bb\u0307_2+2\u03c9\u0307_2 is equal to\nzero.  The evolutions of the resonant angles are reported in\nFig.\u00a0<ref>; they have been produced by running a\nsymplectic integrator of type _3, which is\ndescribed in\u00a0<cit.>.  The plots of the resonant angles\nhighlight that the amplitudes of libration are wide, in particular for the resonant angle \u03bb_1-3\u03bb_2+2\u03c9_1,\nwhich has a width of about 280^\u2218.  This makes the study of the\nlong-term dynamics much more tricky, making it necessary to develop a\nsuitable approach in order to reconstruct the quasi-periodic motion\npointed out by the numerical integrations of the system. This is the\nreason why it is natural to expect that it is convenient to consider\n\u03bb_1-3\u03bb_2+2\u03c9_1 as resonant angle\ninstead of \u03bb_1-3\u03bb_2+2\u03c9_2, the libration amplitude\nof the latter being larger than 360^\u2218.\n\n\n\nFor what concerns the eccentricities, looking at\nFig.\u00a0<ref> one can easily remark that the one of the\ninner planet can also exceed the value 0.3, during its dynamical\nevolution. This makes evident that the orbital configuration of these\nexoplanets is quite different with respect to that of the biggest\nplanets of our Solar System, whose orbits are nearly\ncircular. Therefore, it is natural to expect that a remarkable effort\nwill be needed to adapt normal forms algorithms which worked\nefficiently to construct quasi-periodic approximations of the orbital\nmotions of the major planets in our Solar System\n(see\u00a0<cit.> and\u00a0<cit.>). In order to\nefficiently implement a normal form approach to the HD60532\nextra-solar system, we will need to design a few modifications to that\nbasic scheme. This has to be done in such a way to make it more\nsimilar to the approach that successfully worked in the case of the\n\u03c5\u00a0Andromed\u00e6 planetary system (see\u00a0<cit.>),\nwhich also shows the phenomenon of the librations of the difference of\nthe pericenters arguments (i.e., the so called apsidal locking) as in\nthe case under study of HD60532.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 The resonant model\n\n\nBeing interested in the long-term dynamics of a system\n  that is in MMR, we consider a resonant approximation of the\n  Hamiltonian that allows to reduce the number of degrees of freedom\n  to 2. Hence, we\nnow consider a set of coordinates which allows to better highlight\nthis point.  First of all, let us introduce the action-angle variables\n( I,\u03c9) which replace the secular variables (\u03be,\u03b7) by means of the following canonical transformation:\n\n    \u03be_j= \u221a(2I_j)cos(\u03c9_j) ,\n        \u03b7_j=-\u221a(2I_j)sin(\u03c9_j) ,\n        for   j=1,2 .\n\nNow, we also introduce the resonant variables related to the two\nlibration angles,\n\n    {    p_\u03b4=I_1+2L_1 \n        p_\u03c3=L_1 \n        p_\u03d5=I_1+I_2+2L_1 \n        p_\u03b8=L_2+3L_1\n      .\n              {   \u03b4=\u03c9_2-\u03c9_1 \n       \u03c3=\u03bb_1-3\u03bb_2+2\u03c9_1\n       \u03d5=-\u03c9_2 \n       \u03b8=\u03bb_2\n      .  \n         .\n\nIn this new set of action-angle coordinates, we consider the average\nof the Hamiltonian over the (unique) non-resonant revolution angle\n\u03b8, i.e.,\n\n    H\u0305 = 1/2\u03c0\u222b_0^2\u03c0\n    H(p_\u03b4 , p_\u03c3 , p_\u03d5 , p_\u03b8 , \u03b4 , \u03c3 , \u03d5 , \u03b8)  d\u03b8 .\n\nTherefore, the angles \u03d5 and \u03b8 turn out to be cyclic\nvariables for the Hamiltonian H\u0305.  Indeed, the action\np_\u03d5 is exactly the total angular momentum, which is a constant of\nmotion for the whole three-body planetary system.  Since we perform\nan average of the Hamiltonian with respect to a fast angle of orbital\nrevolution, then it is usual to refer to H\u0305 as a resonant\napproximation at order one in the masses. Such an averaged model shows\ntwo first integrals and can be reduced to two degrees of freedom.\nThe accuracy of the approximation at order one in the masses is discussed in <cit.> and <cit.>, for \ngeneral 2D three-body models of exoplanetary systems and for particular cases in mean-motion resonance, respectively. This is made by means of comparisons with the results  provided by both the approximation at order two in the masses and the numerical integrations of the non-averaged system.\n\n\n\nThe center of the librations of the resonant angles \u03b4 and\n\u03c3 corresponds to an equilibrium point of the angle variables of\nthe resonant Hamiltonian H\u0305.  With the aim of expanding\nthe Hamiltonian H\u0305 around its equilibrium point, we also\nlook for the values, say (p_\u03b4^*,p_\u03c3^*), of the conjugate\nmomenta p_\u03b4 and p_\u03c3 such that the Jacobian of the\nHamiltonian H\u0305 is equal zero.  Once we have determined\nthe equilibrium point[For the problem we are considering, we have found the following values: p_\u03b4^*=0.0227533, p_\u03c3^*=-0.00128589.] (p_\u03b4^*,p_\u03c3^*,\u03c0,\u03c0), we can\ntranslate the origin of the canonical variables, by defining\n\n    y_1=p_\u03b4-p_\u03b4^* ,     y_2=p_\u03c3-p_\u03c3^* ,   \n      x_1=\u03b4-\u03c0 ,    x_2=\u03c3-\u03c0 ,\n\nand expand the Hamiltonian in Taylor series around the origin.  We\nalso proceed with a diagonalization of the quadratic part of the\nHamiltonian.  Indeed, there is a linear canonical\ntransformation[A procedure which allows to determine such a\n  canonical transformation \ud835\udc9e can be found in Section\u00a07 of\n  <cit.>. In order to avoid ambiguities, here the linear transformation C is chosen  in such a way that |\u03c9_1| <|\u03c9_2|.]\n(y_1,y_2,x_1,x_2)=\ud835\udc9e(Y_1,Y_2,X_1,X_2) conjugating the\nquadratic approximation to a couple of harmonic oscillators.  As a\nresult, the Hamiltonian in the new polynomial variables ( Y,\nX) reads\n\n    H( Y, X)=\n      \u03c9_1/2(Y_1^2+X_1^2) + \u03c9_2/2(Y_2^2+X_2^2) +\n      \u2211_\u2113\u2265 1 h_\u2113 ( Y, X)  ,\n \nwhere the functions h_\u2113 are homogeneous polynomials of degree\n\u2113+2 in the variables ( Y, X).  Let us remark that,\naccording to a standard notation in the context of the KAM theory,\nhereafter, \u03c9_1 and \u03c9_2 are used to denote the\nfrequencies (while they have been used before to refer to the\narguments of the pericenters).\n\nThe main goal of this work is to investigate the stability of the\nHamiltonian model given by (<ref>) and to reconstruct its\nquasi-periodic motion, starting from initial conditions corresponding\nto the data reported in Table\u00a0<ref>.  First of all, let\nus stress that the Hamiltonian\u00a0(<ref>) has an elliptic\nequilibrium point at the origin and, in addition, in the case of the\nextra-solar system HD60532, the two frequencies \u03c9_1 and\n\u03c9_2 also have the same sign.  Hence, it would be quite natural\nto try to deal with the problem using a Lyapunov confinement argument\nabout the values of the actions after having performed a few steps of\nthe Birkhoff normalization algorithm.  However, this approach fails because the initial conditions (expressed in the polynomial variables ( Y, X)) are too far from the equilibrium point situated at the origin.\nHence, we need a less naif method in order to tackle the problem under\nstudy.  Therefore, one could try another constructive procedure that\nhas shown to be successful in a similar context, i.e., for models of\nthe secular planetary dynamics (see\u00a0<cit.>,\n<cit.> and\u00a0<cit.>). Indeed, it could\nbe convenient to first introduce action-angle variables, with the aim\nof performing a translation of the actions and then applying the\nstandard Kolmogorov normalization algorithm.  Nevertheless, also this\nattempt fails, because it is not enough to achieve the convergence of\nthe final procedure, even if preceded by a finite number of steps of\nthe Birkhoff normalization algorithm.\n\nWe are then led to develop a different approach which is adapted to\nthe special kind of problem we are considering.  Let us remark that in\nthis model a slow dynamics can be distinguished from a faster one, as\nwe can see from the plots of the two libration angles that are\nreported in the first panel of Fig.\u00a0<ref> and the\nthird one.  In particular, the difference of the argument of the\npericenters points out the slow period, that is (1/\u03bc), while\nthe mean motion resonant angle \u03c3 also highlights the presence\nof a faster period.  Therefore, the key strategy to face the problem\nis to preliminarly average the Hamiltonian with respect to the faster\nlibration angle, namely over an angle related to the MMR. Let us recall that, by applying the procedure mentioned in\nfootnote<ref>1, it can be\neasily shown that the period of such a (so called) fast libration\n  angle is (1/\u221a(\u03bc)). Therefore, it is somehow\nintermediate between the secular angles and the orbital revolution\nones. This justifies the name we have decided to adopt, in order to\nrefer to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 AVERAGE OVER THE FAST LIBRATION ANGLE\n\n\nIn this section we describe the algorithm which allows to perform the\naverage of the Hamiltonian with respect to the fast libration angle.\n\nWe introduce the action-angle variables ( J,\u03d1)\nvia the canonical transformation ( Y, X)=( J,\u03d1), namely\n\n    Y_j= \u221a(2J_j)cos(\u03d1_j) ,\n           X_j=\u221a(2J_j)sin(\u03d1_j) ,     for   j=1,2 .\n\nAfter this canonical change of coordinates the Hamiltonian\n(<ref>) reads\n\n    ^(0)( J,\u03d1)=\u03c9\u00b7 J\n      +\u2211_\u2113\u2265 1 h^(0)_\u2113( J,\u03d1) ,\n          with   ( J,\u03d1)\u2208^2\u00d7^2  ,\n\nwhere the functions h^(0)_\u2113 are homogeneous polynomials of\ndegree \u2113+2 in the square root of the actions J and\ntrigonometric polynomials in the angles \u03d1.  The\nsuperscript refers to the normalization step of the averaging\nalgorithm we are going to describe in detail.\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Formal algorithm for the construction of a resonant Birkhoff normal form\n\n\nAs usual, this normal form is constructed by using the Lie series\nformalism, with the Lie series operator exp( \u03c7)\ndefined as follows:\n\n    exp( \u03c7)=\n    \u2211_s\u2265 01s!\u03c7^s\n      and  \u03c7\u00b7={\u00b7,\u03c7} .\n\nMoreover, we denote by _s the class of functions depending\non the action-angle variables ( J,\u03d1) in such a way\nthat, \u2200 g\u2208_s, g\u2218^-1 is an homogeneous\npolynomial of degree s in the cartesian canonical variables (\nY, X). In more detail, the Taylor-Fourier expansion of a\ngeneric function g\u2208_s can be written as\n\n    g(  J, \u03d1) =\u2211_\u2113\u2208^2\u2113_1+\u2113_2=s \u2211_k_1=-\u2113_1, -\u2113_1+2,\u2026, \u2113_1k_2=-\u2113_2, -\u2113_2+2,\u2026, \u2113_2c_\u2113, k (\u221a(J_1))^\u2113_1 (\u221a(J_2))^\u2113_2exp[ (k_1\u03d1_1+k_2\u03d1_2)] ,\n\nwhere the complex coefficients are such that c_\u2113,-\n  k=c\u0305_\u2113, k. For the sake of brevity, in the\nfollowing we will adopt the usual multi-index notation for the powers\nin the square roots of the actions, i.e, the product\n(\u221a(J_1))^\u2113_1 (\u221a(J_2))^\u2113_2 will be denoted as\n(\u221a( J))^\u2113; moreover, they will be subject to the\nrestriction |\u2113|=s for every term appearing in the expansion\nof a function g\u2208_s, being |\u2113|:=\u2113_1+\u2113_2.\nIn the following Lemma[Its easy\n  proof is sketched (for a wider type of classes of functions) in\n  Subsection\u00a03.1 of\u00a0<cit.>.], we are going to\ndescribe the behaviour of such a class of functions with respect to\nthe Poisson brackets.\n\n  \n  Let f\u2208_s_1+2 and g\u2208_s_2+2, then {f, g}\u2208_s_1+s_2+2 \u2200 s_1\u2208\u2216{0},\n  s_2\u2208\u2216{0}.\n\n\nProceeding in a perturbative way, we want to remove step by step the\ndependence on the fast angle \u03d1_2 (which is related to the\nfast libration angle \u03c3) from the perturbative part of the\nHamiltonian.  Hence, after having performed r-1 canonical changes of\ncoordinates defined by the Lie series operator, the\nHamiltonian\u00a0(<ref>) is brought to the following form:\n\n    ^(r-1)( J,\u03d1)=\n      \u03c9\u00b7 J+\u2211_\u2113= 1^r-1Z_\u2113( J,\u03d1_1)\n      + \u2211_\u2113\u2265 r h_\u2113^(r-1)( J,\u03d1) ,\n\nwhere Z_\u2113\u2208_\u2113+2 and h_\u2113^(r-1)\u2208_\u2113+2.\n\nLet us remark that, with abuse of notation, we are denoting the new\naction-angle variables (that are introduced by the canonical\ntransformation defined by any normalization step) with the same pair\nof symbols ( J,\u03d1), which has been used to denote the\narguments of ^(0). As it is usual for the Lie series formalism,\nthis is done in order to contain the proliferation of the symbols.\n\nThe Hamiltonian in normal form up to order r is obtained as\n^(r)=exp(\u03c7_r)^(r-1), where the generating\nfunction \u03c7_r is determined by solving the homological equation\n\n    \u03c7_r(\u03c9\u00b7 J) +\n      h_r^(r-1)( J,\u03d1)= Z_r( J,\u03d1_1)  ,\n\nwith Z_r( J,\u03d1_1):=\u27e8\nh^(r-1)_r\u27e9_\u03d1_2 where as usual\n\u27e8\u00b7\u27e9_\u03c8 denotes the angular average with respect\nto \u03c8.  In order to solve such an equation, let us first write the\nTaylor-Fourier expansion of the perturbative term as\n\n    h_r^(r-1)( J,\u03d1)=\n     \u2211_\u2113\u2208^2|\u2113|=r+2 \u2211_k_1=-\u2113_1, -\u2113_1+2,\u2026, \u2113_1k_2=-\u2113_2, -\u2113_2+2,\u2026, \u2113_2\n     c_\u2113, k^(r) (\u221a( J))^\u2113exp( k\u00b7\u03d1) .\n\nTherefore, the r-th generating function writes as\n\n    \u03c7_r( J,\u03d1)=\n      \u2211_\u2113\u2208^2|\u2113|=r+2 \u2211_k_1=-\u2113_1, -\u2113_1+2,\u2026, \u2113_1k_2=-\u2113_2, -\u2113_2+2,\u2026, \u2113_2 ; k_2\u2260 0c_\u2113, k^(r)/ k \u00b7\u03c9 (\u221a( J))^\u2113exp( k\u00b7\u03d1) .\n\nClearly, the generating function can be properly defined if and only\nif the frequency vector \u03c9 is non-resonant up to the order\nr+2.  This means that k \u00b7\u03c9\u2260 0\n\u2200 0<| k|\u2264 r+2. Such a property is certainly satisfied if\nwe assume that \u03c9 satisfies the Diophantine condition, namely\n\n    | k \u00b7\u03c9|\u2265\u03b3/| k|^\u03c4 ,\n        \u2200  k\u2208^2\u2216{0} ,\n\nfor some fixed values of \u03b3>0 and \u03c4\u2265 1. Let us also\nrecall that almost all the vectors in ^2 are Diophantine with\nrespect to the Lebesgue measure.\n\nThe transformed functions h_\u2113^(r) appearing in the expansion of\nthe new Hamiltonian\n\n    ^(r)( J,\u03d1)   =\n      \ud835\udcb5^(r)( J,\u03d1_1)+\u211b^(r+1)( J,\u03d1)\n       =\n      \u03c9\u00b7 J+\u2211_\u2113= 1^rZ_\u2113( J,\u03d1_1)\n      + \u2211_\u2113\u2265 r+1 h_\u2113^(r)( J,\u03d1) ,\n\nare defined as follows\n\n    h_\u2113^(r)= \u2211_j=0^\u230a\u2113/r \u230b1/j!\u03c7_r^j h^(r-1)_\u2113-jr ,\n                              for \u2113\u2265 r+1 .\n\nA simple induction argument, which is based on the application\nof Lemma\u00a0<ref>, allows us to verify that\nh^(r)_\u2113\u2208_\u2113+2 \u2200 \u2113.\nHence, after a finite number r of normalization steps, we get the\nHamiltonian ^(r), which is the sum of a normal form part\n\ud835\udcb5^(r)( J,\u03d1_1)=\u03c9\u00b7\nJ+\u2211_\u2113= 1^rZ_\u2113( J,\u03d1_1), which is integrable,\nand a remainder \u211b^(r+1)( J,\u03d1)=\u2211_\u2113\u2265 r+1 h_\u2113^(r)( J,\u03d1).\nIndeed, the averaged part \ud835\udcb5^(r)( J,\u03d1_1) is\nindependent of the fast angle \u03d1_2.  Therefore, the action\nJ_2 is constant along the flow induced by \ud835\udcb5^(r),\nbecause {J_2 , \ud835\udcb5^(r)}=0. Moreover, the\naveraged part \ud835\udcb5^(r) results in an integrable\napproximation, because it can be reduced to an Hamiltonian having just\none degree of freedom.\n\nFor later convenience, it is also worth to recall that the canonical\ntransformation \ud835\udc9e^(r) defining the resonant Birkhoff\nnormal form up to the r-th step of the constructive algorithm is\nexplicitly given by\n\n    \ud835\udc9e^(r)( J,\u03d1)=\n      exp\u03c7_r \u2218 exp\u03c7_r-1 \u2218 \u2026 exp\u03c7_1 ( J,\u03d1) .\n\nIn fact, the exchange theorem for Lie series ensures us that\n^(r)( J,\u03d1)=^(0)(\ud835\udc9e^(r)( J,\u03d1))\n\u2200 ( J,\u03d1)\u2208( 0)\u00d7^2,\nbeing ( 0) a suitable open ball centered\naround the origin of ^2 (see\u00a0<cit.>\nand\u00a0<cit.>).\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Comparison between numerical integrations and semi-analytic solutions\n\n\nIn this subsection, we are going to check the validity of the averaged\nHamiltonian up to a finite order r\u0303 (namely the integrable\napproximation \ud835\udcb5^(r\u0303)) in describing the orbital\nmotions induced by the Hamiltonian\u00a0(<ref>) which describes the slow dynamics of a planetary system in MMR.  For what\nconcerns our extra-solar model, this latter Hamiltonian, expressed in\naction-angle variables as in\u00a0(<ref>), has been expanded\nup to order 6 in the square root of the actions.  We perform 6\nnormalization steps and our goal is to compare numerical\nintegrations[All the computations discussed in the present\nSection and in the following one, which are both of symbolic type and\nof purely numerical kind, have been performed by using Mathematica.] of the Hamiltonian in MMR (<ref>) with the\nsemi-analytic solution of the averaged Hamiltonian up to order 6,\nboth described in the cartesian variables Y_j=\n\u221a(2J_j)cos(\u03d1_j) and X_j=\u221a(2J_j)sin(\u03d1_j),\nfor j=1,2. The choice r\u0303=6 allows to obtain\n  a reasonable balance between the accuracy and the needed\n  computational time.\n\n\nLet us recall that the averaged Hamiltonian \ud835\udcb5^(6) is\nintegrable according to the\nLiouville-Arnold-Jost theorem (for a complete proof, see,\ne.g.,\u00a0<cit.>).  Therefore, there exists an\nanalytic expression (eventually involving also the computation of\nintegrals and the inversion of some functions) which defines a\ncanonical transformation ( J,\u03d1)=\u03a8( P,\u03c6),\nsuch that the averaged approximation \ud835\udcb5^(6) depends on\nthe actions P only, when it is transformed according to the\nchange of variables \u03a8, i.e.,\n\n    \u2202 \ud835\udcb5^(6)(\u03a8( P,\u03c6))/\u2202\u03c6_j=0\n      \u2200 j=1, 2 .\n Thus, in the new set of action-angle variables ( P,\u03c6) the equations of motion related to the averaged Hamiltonian\n\ud835\udcb5^(6)\u2218\u03a8 can be solved very easily.  Moreover, we\ncan also evaluate the composition \ud835\udc9e^(6) of canonical\ntransformations introduced in the previous Subsection in order to\ndefine the action-angle variables ( P,\u03c6) and to\nobtain the Hamiltonian in normal form up to order 6. The normal form\nalgorithm can be finally translated in a so called semi-analytic\nprocedure which allows to determine the motion law t\u21a6(\nY(t), X(t)) that is defined by the flow induced by the averaged\nHamiltonian \ud835\udcb5^(6). Such a computational procedure is\nsummarized (\u2200 t\u2208) by the following scheme:\n\n    [row sep=5em, column sep=9em,every label/.append style = font = ]\n      ( Y(0), X(0)) [r, \"(\u2218\ud835\udc9e^(6)\u2218\u03a8)^-1\",shorten <=1em,shorten >=1em]    ( P(0),\u03c6(0)) [d, \"\u03a6_\ud835\udcb5^(6)\u2218\u03a8^t\",shorten <=0.5em,shorten >=0.5em] \n    ( Y(t), X(t)) [r,leftarrow,\"\u2218\ud835\udc9e^(6)\u2218\u03a8\",shorten <=0.5em,shorten >=0.5em]    ( P(t)= P(0),\u03c6(t)=\u03b2 t+\u03c6(0))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03a6_\ud835\udcb5^(6)\u2218\u03a8^t is nothing but the flow at\ntime t induced by the Hamiltonian \ud835\udcb5^(6)\u2218\u03a8 and\nthe angular velocity is given by \u03b2_j=\u2202/\u2202\n  P_j(\ud835\udcb5^(6)\u2218\u03a8), while  and\n\ud835\udc9e^(6) are defined in\u00a0(<ref>)\nand\u00a0(<ref>), respectively.  Let us stress that the\ninitial conditions ( P(0),\u03c6(0)) can be obtained by\ninverting the composition of the canonical transformations previously\ndescribed, while the initial conditions ( Y(0), X(0)) are the\nones derived from the observations.  This semi-analytic solution could\nbe compared with the one obtained by a direct integration of the\nHamiltonian\u00a0(<ref>).  For the sake of simplicity, we do not\nperform the last canonical transformation \u03a8, which is essential\nto properly define the semi-analytic\nscheme\u00a0(<ref>), but it would require to perform\nsome operations (e.g., the aforementioned integrals and the inversions\nof functions) that can be hard to implement in a fully explicit way.\nWe just exploit the uniqueness of the solution of the corresponding\nCauchy problem and we approximate it numerically, by directly\nintegrating the equations of motion of the averaged Hamiltonian\n\ud835\udcb5^(6).  Afterwards, we use the canonical\ntransformations\u00a0(<ref>)\nand\u00a0(<ref>) to express the solution in the\nvariables ( Y(t), X(t)) and we compare it with the numerical\nintegration of the Hamiltonian\u00a0(<ref>).\n\nAs we can see from the plots in\u00a0Fig. <ref>, for the\nrelatively faster pair of variables (Y_2,X_2) we have a good\nagreement between the two solutions, both in terms of amplitude and in\nterms of frequency.  Instead, as regards the slow variables\n(Y_1,X_1), there is a remarkable error concerning the frequency.\nIn principle, this discrepancy might be amended with an approximation\n  at order two in the masses (which can be adapted to planetary systems in MMR, as explained in\u00a0<cit.>), but this goes beyond the scope of the present paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACTION-ANGLE VARIABLES ADAPTED TO THE INTEGRABLE APPROXIMATION\n\n\nBefore showing that KAM theorem applies in the present context, we\nneed another preliminary essential step in order to make the algorithm\nconvergent.  Specifically, we have to introduce a set of action-angle\nvariables, that are more suitable to describe the integrable\napproximation of the Hamiltonian\u00a0(<ref>) than the pair\n( J,\u03d1) as it is defined after having performed the\ncanonical transformation \ud835\udc9e^(6). Indeed, the ideal\naction-angle coordinates would be ( P,\u03c6), the\nones we avoided to compute, because of the technical difficulties due\nto an eventual application of the Liouville-Arnold-Jost theorem. Let us\nrecall that P_1 and P_2 would be constant of motion for the\nintegrable approximation \ud835\udcb5^(6) and the same holds true\nalso for the action J_2.\n\nHence, if we consider the orbit of the fast motion of the integrable\napproximation \ud835\udcb5^(6) in the cartesian\nvariables[Let us remark that, once again, with a little abuse\n  of notation, we are denoting the variables used before and after the\n  averaging normalization algorithm with the same name.]\n(Y_2,X_2)=(\u221a(2J_2)cos(\u03d1_2),\u221a(2J_2)sin(\u03d1_2)),\nwe get a circular orbit, as it is shown in the right panel of\nFig.\u00a0<ref>.  Instead, looking at the orbit of the\nslow motion in the cartesian variables\n(Y_1,X_1)=(\u221a(2J_1)cos(\u03d1_1),\u221a(2J_1)sin(\u03d1_1)),\nthat are related to the secular dynamics, we can observe that such an\norbit is far from being circular.  Therefore, at this stage we aim at\nintroducing a second action which is closer than J_1 to be a\nconstant of motion. In other words, our approach consists in the\nconstruction of action-angle variables with the aim of trying to\ncircularize (at least partially) the orbit describing the slow\ndynamics in the integrable approximation.  Thus, trying to introduce\nan action which depends only on the distance from the origin in the\ncartesian plane endowed with coordinates (Y_1,X_1), we are dealing\nwith a quasi-constant of motion and we approach better the sought\n(final) KAM torus. From a practical point of view, our approach is\ntranslated in an explicit computational procedure, by suitably\napplying the frequency analysis method to the flow induced by the\nintegrable approximation \ud835\udcb5^(6) (see\u00a0<cit.>\nfor an introduction to such a numerical technique). This can be done\nby studying the Fourier decomposition of the signal Y_1(t)+\nX_1(t)\u2243\u2211_j=1^\ud835\udca9_cA_1,j e^(k_j\u03bd_1\n  t+\u03c6_1,j), where \ud835\udca9_c is the number of\ncomponents considered, A_1,j>0, k_j\u2208,\n\u03c6_1,j\u2208(-\u03c0,\u03c0] and 2\u03c0/\u03bd_1 is the period of such a\nmotion law.  By taking into consideration only the \ud835\udca9_c=3\ncomponents of the signal which correspond to k_j=0,\u00b1 1 for\nj=1,2,3, it is easy to show that the corresponding approximation of\nthe orbit which describes the secular dynamics is an ellipse.\nTherefore, in order to give a circular shape to such an approximation\nof the orbit it is necessary to perform two changes of coordinates: a\nshift on the variable X_1 of a translation value X_1^* and a\ndilatation/contraction with coefficient \u03b1.  The value X_1^*\nof the translation is determined by exploiting the constant component\n(because for j=1 we have k_1=0 and \u03c6_1,1=-\u03c0/2, then\nA_1,j e^\u03c6_1,1 is purely imaginary and so is\naligned with the X_1 axis), while the coefficient \u03b1 is\ndefined as follows\n\n    \u03b1=\u221a(c_- -c_+/c_- +c_+) ,\n\nwhere c_- and c_+ are the absolute values of the complex\ncoefficients of the components with k_2=-1 and k_3=1,\nrespectively. In more detail, we define c_-=A_1,2 and\nc_+=A_1,3 for j=2,3; indeed, the easy computation of the\nsuitable coefficient \u03b1 of dilatation/contraction takes\nprofit of the values of the corresponding angles, which are\nsuch that \u03c6_1,2=-\u03c6_1,3. Therefore, we\nintroduce the new variables\n\n    v_1=\u03b1\u00b7 Y_1 ,      u_1=X_1-X_1^*/\u03b1 .\n\n\n\n\nThe new orbit of the slow motion in the variables (v_1,u_1) is\nrepresented in Fig.\u00a0<ref>.  Let us remark that this plot\ndoes not represent exactly a circular orbit; this was somehow expected\nsince we have considered only a limited number of Fourier components\nin the computational method we have introduced in the present Section\nwith the aim of trying to circularize the orbit itself.  However, by\nlooking at the scales reported on the vertical axes of the two panels\nincluded in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, one can appreciate that the\ncanonical change of coordinates\u00a0(<ref>) allows\nus to reduce the oscillations of the value of the action involved in\nthe description of the slow dynamics. In fact, when the plot of the\nmotion law t\u21a6(Y_1^2(t)+X_1^2(t))/2 is compared to the\none of t\u21a6(v_1^2(t)+u_1^2(t))/2, the gain of about 30%\nin the circularization of the orbit is highlighted.  This is enough\nfor the purpose of obtaining a Kolmogorov normalization algorithm\nwhich is convergent to the normal form related to the desired final\ninvariant torus.\n\n\n\n\nWe can now introduce the action-angle variables that are more\nsuitably adapted to the integrable approximation, i.e.,\n\n    v_1   =\u221a(2(p_1+p_1^*))cos(q_1) ,\n           Y_2   =\u221a(2J_2)cos(\u03d1_2) ,\n    \n      u_1   =\u221a(2(p_1+p_1^*))sin(q_1) , \n           X_2   =\u221a(2J_2)sin(\u03d1_2) ,\n\nwhere p_1^* is the value of the area enclosed by the orbit that\ndescribes the secular dynamics in the phase plane (v_1,u_1) (or in\nthe one endowed with coordinates (Y_1,X_1), since canonical\ntransformations preserve the areas) multiplied by the factor\n1/(2\u03c0). Therefore, we are imposing that the value p_1^*, which\ncorresponds to the closed curve {(p_1,q_1) : p_1=0 ,\nq_1\u2208}, is equal to the usual definition of the action for\nHamiltonian systems with one degree of freedom (see, e.g., Chap.\u00a03\nof\u00a0<cit.>).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 CONSTRUCTION OF THE KAM TORUS\n\n\nWe can now start the construction of the KAM torus for the averaged dynamics of HD60532.  First, we perform a\ntranslation of the fast action and we rename the fast angle, i.e.\n\n    p_2=J_2-J_2^*  ,      q_2=\u03d1_2 ,\n\nwhere J_2^* is the mean value of the action J_2.  In the new\naction-angle variables ( p, q) the Hamiltonian\n(<ref>) can be expanded as follows\n\n    1#   #   #\n     H^(0)( p, q)    =\n        E^(0)+\u03c9^(0)\u00b7 p\n     +\u2211_s\u2265 0\u2211_\u2113\u2265 2 f_\u2113^(0,s)( p, q)\n           +\u2211_s\u2265 1( f_0^(0,s)( q) + f_1^(0,s)( p, q)) ,\n\nwhere f_\u2113^(0,s) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree \u2113 in\np and a trigonometric polynomial of degree[More\n  generically, the functions f_\u2113^(0,s) are usually defined as\n  trigonometric polynomials of degree sK (for some positive fixed\n  value of the parameter K\u2208) in q. We choose to set\n  K=2, accordingly to what is usually done for quasi-integrable\n  Hamiltonian system that are in the vicinity of an elliptic\n  equilibrium point as it is in the model we are studying (see,\n  e.g.,\u00a0<cit.> and recall the discussion in\n  Section\u00a0<ref>).] 2s in q. The first\nsuperscript of the functions f_\u2113^(0,s) denotes the\nnormalization step.  Furthermore, E^(0) is the constant of the\nenergy level of p=0 when f_\u2113^(0,s)=0 \u2200 \u2113\nand s=0, 1.  The goal is to construct the Kolmogorov normal form\n\n    H^(\u221e)( p, q)=\u03c9^*\u00b7 p +( p^2) ,\n\nwhere \u03c9^* is the angular velocity vector characterizing the\nquasi-periodic motion on the invariant (KAM) torus corresponding to\np= 0. In other words, the Kolmogorov normalization algorithm\nis designed in such a way to remove the terms appearing in the second\nrow of formula\u00a0(<ref>) by a sequence of canonical\ntransformations.  Here, it is convenient to adopt a different version\nof the classical Kolmogorov normalization algorithm, which is slightly\nmodified in such a way to not keep fixed the angular velocity vector\n\u03c9^(r), that is defined at the r-th step of the\nprocedure and corresponds to the quasi-periodic approximation of the\nmotion on the final sought KAM torus. We basically follow the approach\ndescribed in\u00a0<cit.>, where the normalization procedure introduced by Kolmogorov is adapted in such a way to skip the small translation of the actions performed at every step of that algorithm. This modification allows to make the computational procedure more stable; such an improvement can play a crucial role when the action\u2013frequency map is (close to be) degenerate (see <cit.>). Moreover, in order to improve its efficiency, this small adaptation of the Kolmogorov normalization algorithm has to be formulated so as to suitably determine the preliminary translation in (<ref>). All this computational procedure is summarized in the\nfollowing in order to make our discussion rather\nself-consistent.\n\nAs in Section\u00a0<ref>, it is convenient to introduce suitable\nclasses of functions; here, we are going to say that g\u2208_\u2113,sK\nif its Taylor-Fourier expansion writes as\n\n    g( p,  q) =\n      \u2211_ j\u2208^n|  j|=\u2113\u2211_ k\u2208^n|  k|\u2264 sK \n      c_ j, k  p^ jexp( k\u00b7 q)  ,\n\nfor some fixed values of the non-negative integer parameters\n\u2113, s and K. The following statement allows us to describe the\nbehaviour of such a class of functions with respect to the Poisson\nbrackets.\n\n  \n  Let us consider two generic functions g\u2208_\u2113,sK and\n  h\u2208_m,rK, where K is a fixed positive integer\n  number. Then, the following inclusion property holds\n  true:\n  \n    {g,h} = h g \u2208_\u2113+m-1,(r+s)K   \u2200\u2113, m, r, s\u2208  with \u2113+m\u2265 1 ,\n\n  while {g,h} = 0 when \u2113=m=0.\n\n\nLet us imagine to have already performed r-1 normalization steps by\nusing, once again, the Lie series formalism; then, we have to\ndeal with an Hamiltonian of the following type:\n\n    1#   #   #\n     H^(r-1)( p, q)    =\n        E^(r-1)+\u03c9^(r-1)\u00b7 p\n     +\u2211_s\u2265 0\u2211_\u2113\u2265 2 f_\u2113^(r-1,s)( p, q)\n           +\u2211_s\u2265 r( f_0^(r-1,s)( q) + f_1^(r-1,s)( p, q))\n      ,\n\nwhere f_\u2113^(r-1,s)\u2208_\u2113,2s\n\u2200 \u2113, s \u2208, while E^(r-1)\u2208. Let us\nremark that the expansion of H^(0), which is reported\nin\u00a0(<ref>), agrees with the more general one, that is written\njust above in\u00a0(<ref>), in the case with r=1. The Kolmogorov\nnormalization algorithm at step r is aimed to remove the main\nperturbing terms (that are the functions f_0^(r-1,r) and\nf_1^(r-1,r)), which are independent of and linear in the actions,\nrespectively.\n\nIn order to perform the r-th normalization step, first we need to\ndetermine the generating function \u03c7_0^(r) in such a way to\nsolve the following homological equation:\n\n    \u03c7_0^(r)(\u03c9^(r-1)\u00b7 p) +f_0^(r-1,r)=\n      \u27e8 f_0^(r-1,r)\u27e9_ q .\n\nAs a matter of fact,\n\u27e8 f_0^(r-1,r)\u27e9_ q\u2208_0,0 is nothing but a\nconstant term. Therefore, it can be added to E^(r-1), in order\nto update the energy level, whose new value is denoted with E^(r).\nBy considering the Taylor-Fourier expansion of the perturbing term we\naim to remove, i.e.,\n\n    f_0^(r-1,r)( q)=\n      \u2211_0<| k|\u2264 2r c_ 0, k^(r-1,r)exp( k\u00b7 q) ,\n\nwe obtain the following expression for the generating function:\n\n    \u03c7_0^(r)( q) = \u2211_0<| k|\u2264 2rc_ 0, k^(r-1,r)/ k\u00b7\u03c9^(r-1)exp( k\u00b7 q) .\n\nLet us remark that the homological equation can be solved provided\nthat the following non-resonance condition holds true\n\n    k\u00b7\u03c9^(r-1)\u2260 0 ,     \u2200  k\u2208^2\u2216{0} ,\n        with   | k|\u2264 2r .\n\n\nWe then introduce the transformed Hamiltonian\n\u0124^(r)=exp(\u03c7_0^(r))H^(r-1),\nwhose expansion\n\n    1#   #   #\u0124^(r)( p, q)    =\n        \u00ca^(r)+\u03c9^(r-1)\u00b7 p\n     +\u2211_s\u2265 0\u2211_\u2113\u2265 2f\u0302_\u2113^(r,s)( p, q)\n           +\u2211_s\u2265 r( f\u0302_0^(r,s)( q) +\n     f\u0302_1^(r,s)( p, q))\n\nis such that the new Hamiltonian terms f\u0302_\u2113^(r,s) are defined\nso that\n\n    f\u0302_0^(r,r)   = 0  , \n    f\u0302_\u2113^(r,s)   = \u2211_j=0^\u230a s/r \u230b1/j!\u03c7^(r)_0^j f^(r-1,s-jr)_\u2113+j ,\n                for \u2113=0, s\u2260 r ,-2pt-14pt or \u2113\u22600  s\u2265 0 .\n\nBy applying repeatedly Lemma\u00a0<ref>, one\ncan easily verify that f\u0302_\u2113^(r,s)\u2208_\u2113,2s\n\u2200 \u2113, s.\n\nThe second generating function \u03c7_1^(r) is determined by solving\nthe following homological equation:\n\n    \u03c7_1^(r)(\u03c9^(r-1)\u00b7 p )+\n      f\u0302_1^(r,r)=\u27e8f\u0302_1^(r,r)\u27e9_ q .\n\nThe term \u27e8f\u0302_1^(r,r)\u27e9_ q\u2208_1,0. This\nmeans that it is not dependent on the angles q and is linear in\nthe actions p; thus, it gives a contribution to the definition\nof the value of the angular velocity vector \u03c9^(r), which\nin principle should converge to its limit \u03c9^* (if the\nnormalization algorithm is convergent) and is defined so that\n\n    \u03c9^(r)\u00b7 p=\n      \u03c9^(r-1)\u00b7 p +\u27e8f\u0302_1^(r,r)\u27e9_ q .\n\n\nBy considering the following Taylor-Fourier expansion of the new\nperturbing term we aim to remove, i.e.\n\n    f\u0302_1^(r,r)( q) - \u27e8f\u0302_1^(r,r)\u27e9_ q =\n      \u2211_|\u2113|=1 \u2211_0<| k|\u2264 2r\u0109_\u2113, k^(r,r) p^\u2113exp( k\u00b7 q) ,\n\nthen we easily determine the new generating function as\n\n    \u03c7_1^(r)( q)= \u2211_|\u2113|=1 \u2211_0<| k|\u2264 2r\u0109_\u2113, k^(r,r)/ k\u00b7\u03c9^(r-1) p^\u2113exp( k\u00b7 q) .\n\nOnce again, the homological equation can be solved provided that the\nfrequencies satisfy the non resonance condition\u00a0(<ref>).\nThe new Hamiltonian is defined as\nH^(r)=exp(\u03c7_1^(r))\u0124^(r-1). Its\nexpansion is completely analogous to the one reported\nin\u00a0(<ref>). Moreover,\nthe terms f_\u2113^(r,s)\u2208_\u2113,2s appearing in the\nexpansion of H^(r) are defined in the following way:\n\n    f_1^(r,r)   = 0  , \n    \n    f_1^(r,ir)   =\n    i-1/i!\u03c7^(r)_1^i-1f\u0302^(r,r)_1+\n    \u2211_j=0^i-21/j!\u03c7^(r)_1^jf\u0302^(r,(i-j)r)_1 ,\n            for i\u2265 2 ,\n     \n    f_\u2113^(r,s)   =\n    \u2211_j=0^\u230a s/r \u230b1/j!\u03c7^(r)_1^jf\u0302^(r,s-jr)_\u2113 ,\n            for \u2113=1, s\u2260 ir ,-2pt-14pt or \u2113\u22601,  s\u2265 0 ,\n\nwhere we have exploited the second homological\nequation\u00a0(<ref>).\n\nFrom a practical point of view, we can iterate the algorithm only up\nto a finite number of steps, say, r. This allows us to\ndetermine\n\n    H^(r)( p, q)=E^(r)\n      +\u03c9^(r)\u00b7 p\n      +\u2211_s\u2265 0\u2211_\u2113\u2265 2 f_\u2113^(r,s)( p, q)\n      +\u2211_s\u2265r+1( f_0^(r,s)( q) + f_1^(r,s)( p, q))\n       .\n\nHence, we obtain an approximation of the final invariant torus which\nis characterized by an angular velocity vector\n\u03c9^(r).  If the value (say) I_1^* of the\ninitial shift on the first action, which has been preliminarly fixed\nequal to p_1^* in formula\u00a0(<ref>), is accurate\nenough, then the slow frequency \u03c9^(r)_1 is close\nto the one we are aiming at, which is numerically determined by\napplying the frequency analysis method, namely\n\u03c9^(r)_1\u2243\u03c9_1^*.  We then calibrate the\ninitial translation of the first action I_1^*=p_1^* by means of a\nNewton method.  The goal is to solve the implicit equation\n\u03c9_1(\u0128_1)=\u03c9_1^* with respect to the initial\nshift \u0128_1.  The value \u0128_1 is iteratively\ncomputed using the formula\n\n    \u0128_1^(n)=\u0128_1^(n-1)+\n      \u03c9_1^*-\u03c9_1^(r)(\u0128_1^(n-1))/\u03c9_1^'(\u0128_1^(n-1)) ,\n\nwhere \u0128_1^(0)=I_1^* and the value of the derivative\n\u03c9_1^'(\u0128_1^(n-1)) is numerically\napproximated by using the finite difference method.  Let us recall\nthat, after having performed the average with respect to the fast\nangle of libration as it has been described in the previous section,\nwe are mainly focusing on the study of the secular dynamics.  In\naddition, for what concerns the (relatively) faster frequency\n\u03c9_2^(r)/(2\u03c0) we automatically have a good enough\napproximation of both the frequencies of the averaged Hamiltonian, as\nit can be appreciated looking at the comparison between the\nsemi-analytic solutions showed in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, which will\nbe widely commented in the next subsection.\n\nBy supposing to iterate the normalization algorithm ad infinitum, one\nwould get the Hamiltonian (<ref>), which admits the\ninvariant torus p=0 with frequency \u03c9^*.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, we are able to explicitly iterate the\nalgorithm only up to a finite normalization step r and we\ncan numerically check the convergence of the procedure by controlling\nthe decrease of the norms of the generating functions. Hereafter, we\ndefine the norm of any generic function g\u2208_\u2113,sK as\n\n    g( p,  q) =\n    \u2211_ j\u2208^n|  j|=\u2113\u2211_ k\u2208^n|  k|\u2264 sK|c_ j, k| ,\n\n\u2200 \u2113, s, K \u2208, where the Taylor-Fourier\nexpansion of g is written\nin\u00a0(<ref>).  The behavior of \u03c7_0^(r) and\n\u03c7_1^(r) for values of the normalization step r up to\u00a09\nare reported in Fig.\u00a0<ref>.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Comparison between two different kinds of semi-analytic solutions\n\n\nIn this subsection we check the accuracy of the\nHamiltonian\u00a0(<ref>) in Kolmogorov normal form up to a\nfinite order r in describing the motion of the averaged\nintegrable Hamiltonian \ud835\udcb5^(r\u0303) up to order r\u0303.  For what concerns our model of the librational dynamics of the\nextrasolar system HD60532, we consider the Hamiltonian H^(5),\nexpanded as in (<ref>) and truncated up to degree 2\nin the actions and to trigonometrical degree 12 in the angles.  The\naim is to make a comparison with the solution associated to the\naveraged integrable Hamiltonian \ud835\udcb5^(6), computed in\nSubsection\u00a0<ref>.  The semi-analytic solution of\nthe equations of motion which is related to the Hamiltonian H^(5)\ncan be obtained with a procedure similar to the one previously\ndescribed and represented in\u00a0(<ref>).\nMoreover, as we can see in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, we compare the\nmotion laws induced by two different Hamiltonians by considering in\nboth cases the cartesian variables Y_j=\u221a(2J_j)cos(\u03d1_j)\nand X_j=\u221a(2J_j)sin(\u03d1_j), for j=1, 2, that were\nadopted as canonical coordinates before starting the averaging\nprocedure which constructs the resonant Birkhoff normal form. In more\ndetail, we can determine the expansions of all the canonical\ntransformations introduced in Sections\u00a0<ref>,\n<ref> and\u00a0<ref> with the aim of constructing\na Hamiltonian in Kolmogorov normal form up to order 5. Let us denote\nwith the symbol \ud835\udca6^(5) the composition of the canonical\ntransformations introduced by the Kolmogorov algorithm (described in\nthe previous Subsection) up to the 5-th normalization step, i.e.,\n\n    \ud835\udca6^(5)( p, q)=\n      exp\u03c7_1^(5) \u2218 exp\u03c7_0^(5) \u2218 \u2026 \u2218exp\u03c7_1^(1) \u2218 exp\u03c7_0^(1) ( p, q) .\n\nTherefore, \u2200 t\u2208, we can compute the values of the\ncanonical variables ( Y(t), X(t)) corresponding to the (\np(t), q(t))=(0,\u03c9^(5) t+ q(0)), which describe the\nquasi-periodic motion of the final KAM torus as it is approximately reproduced by the Kolmogorov normalization algorithm,\nwhen it is iterated up to the 5-th step. This computation is\nperformed according to the following scheme:\n\n    [row sep=5em, column sep=10em,every label/.append style = font = ]\n      ( Y(0), X(0)) [r, \"(\u2218\ud835\udc9e^(5)\u2218\ud835\udcaf_\u0128_1\u2218\ud835\udca6^(5))^-1\",shorten <=1em,shorten >=1em]    ( 0, q(0)) [d, \"\u03a6_\u03c9^(5)\u00b7 p^t\",shorten <=0.5em,shorten >=0.5em] \n    ( Y(t), X(t)) [r,leftarrow,\"\u2218\ud835\udc9e^(5)\u2218\ud835\udcaf_\u0128_1\u2218\ud835\udca6^(5)\",shorten <=0.5em,shorten >=0.5em]    ( p(t)= 0, q(t)=\u03c9^(5) t+ q(0))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere a few further explanations are in order. We denote with (\nJ,\u03d1)=\ud835\udcaf_\u0128_1( p, q) the canonical\ntransformation that is obtained by making the composition of all the\ncanonical transformations described in Section\u00a0<ref>\nand in formula\u00a0(<ref>); moreover, one has to\ntake care of slightly modifying\u00a0(<ref>) in\nsuch a way to replace p_1^* with the value of \u0128_1 (i.e.,\nthe solution of equation \u03c9_1(\u0128_1)=\u03c9_1^*\nnumerically obtained by applying the Newton method). In the\nscheme\u00a0(<ref>) we have also decided to\nconsider \ud835\udc9e^(5) instead of \ud835\udc9e^(6), because\notherwise with the adopted rules of truncation the Hamiltonian would\nbe integrable already before the Kolmogorov normalization; this would\nmake trivial the application of such an algorithm. Finally, let us\nrecall that H^(5)( p, q)\u2243\u03c9^(5)\u00b7 p\n+( p^2) and \u03c9^(5)\u2243\u03c9^*; this allows us\nto put the flow of \u03c9^(5)\u00b7 p in order to\napproximate (in the semi-analytical scheme above) the solution of the\nequations of motion related to H^(5) and with initial conditions\np(0)= 0.\n\n\n\nThe plots in Fig. <ref> show an excellent\nsuperimposition between the two solutions, with respect to both the\namplitudes and the frequencies. This makes evident the effectiveness\nof our computational algorithm. Let us also recall that the initial\nconditions ( Y(0), X(0)) are the ones compatible with the\nobservations.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Computer-assisted proof\n\n\nBy looking at the plots in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, it can be\nnoticed that the decrease of the norms of the generating functions, in\nparticular for what concerns the finite sequence of the second\ngenerating function \u03c7_1^(r), is not so regular and the\nconvergence of the algorithm looks doubtful.  In order to rigorously\nprove that the KAM algorithm is convergent, we adopt a rigorous\napproach based on a computer-assisted proof. For this purpose, we\nfollow the method which has been described in\u00a0<cit.> and\nfurther developed in\u00a0<cit.>, where a publicly available\nsoftware package[That software package can be freely\n  downloaded from the web address <http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/jdx22ysh2s.1>] is provided as\nsupplementary material. Such a package is designed for doing just this\nkind of computer-assisted proof for Hamiltonian systems having two\ndegrees of freedom. In order to use this software so as to apply it to\nthe problem under consideration, it is just matter to prepare some\ninput files, which basically describe the starting Hamiltonian; in\nprinciple, this can allow us to prove the existence of the KAM torus\nwe are aiming at, if the corresponding Kolmogorov normal form is close\nenough to such an initial Hamiltonian. More precisely, we consider\nH^(5) as the starting Hamiltonian. It is fully determined at the\nend of the application of the Newton method, which has been described\nin the previous Section; in terms of a single mathematical formula, it\ncan be written as\n\n    H\u2218\u2218\ud835\udc9e^(5)\u2218\ud835\udcaf_\u0128_1\u2218\ud835\udca6^(5)\n\nwhere H, , \ud835\udc9e^(5),\n\ud835\udcaf_\u0128_1 and \ud835\udca6^(5) are defined\nin\u00a0(<ref>), (<ref>),\n(<ref>), just below\nformula\u00a0(<ref>)\nand\u00a0(<ref>), respectively.  Moreover, the expansion\nof H^(5) can be written as in\u00a0(<ref>) and is\ntruncated up to degree 2 in the actions and to trigonometrical\ndegree 12 in the angles, while the expansion\u00a0(<ref>)\nof the intermediate Hamiltonian\n^(5)=H\u2218\u2218\ud835\udc9e^(5) has been preliminarly\ntruncated so as to exclude the sum of terms \u2211_\u2113>6\nh_\u2113^(r)( J,\u03d1)=( J^7/2).\nTherefore, H^(5) is not in Kolmogorov normal form because of a few\n(small) Hamiltonian terms that are either dependent on the angles q only or linearly dependent on the actions p.\n\nDuring the initial stage of the computer-assisted proof, a first code\nexplicitly performs a (possibly large) number R_ I of\nnormalization steps of a classical formulation of the Kolmogorov\nalgorithm, which includes also small translations of the actions that\naim at keeping fixed the desired angular velocity vector of the\nquasi-periodic motion on the final torus, i.e.,\n\u03c9^*. Afterwards, the size of the perturbation is further\nreduced (although in a less efficient way) by another code which just\niterates the estimates of the norms of the terms of order r with\nR_ I<r\u2264 R_ II. In the case of the model we are\nstudying, in order to achieve the convergence of the algorithm, we\nhave found convenient to set R_ I=200 and R_ II=20 000.\nThe whole computer-assisted proof[The\n    software package allowing to perform the computer-assisted proof\n    of theorem\u00a0<ref> is available at https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~locatell/CAPs/CAP4KAM-HD60532.zip\n As\n    a matter of fact, the codes included in this software package are\n    exactly the same as the ones which can be downloaded from the\n    website mentioned in\n    footnote<ref>1. The\n    differences between the two packages just concern the files\n    defining the expansions of the initial Hamiltonians to which the\n    computer-assisted proofs are applied.] required a total\ncomputational time of about 52.5 hours on a\nworkstation equipped with CPUs of type \n(2.2\u00a0GHz) and 384\u00a0GB of RAM. Nearly all the time (i.e., more than\n50\u00a0hours) has been requested by the first explicit\ncomputation of the (truncated) expansions of the Hamiltonians\nH^(r) for r=1 , \u2026 , R_I=200.\n\n\n\nThe plot of the norms of the generating functions \u03c7_1^(r) (in\nsemi-log scale) is reported in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, where\nthe occurrence of a regular decrease is clearly highlighted.  In\nparticular, looking at the panel on the right, we can appreciate that\nthe decrease is sharper for the first R_ I normalization steps,\nwhere the expansions of the generating functions are computed\nexplicitly.  Afterwards, there is a transition to the regime of the\niteration of the norms and, after some initially periodic jumps, the\ndecrease becomes more regular.\n\nAt the end of the running of the codes which make part of the software\npackage designed to perform this kind of computer-assisted proofs,\nupper bounds for all the terms appearing in the expansion of\nH^(R_ II), which is written as in\u00a0(<ref>),\nare available. Therefore, one can check in an automatic way the\napplicability of the KAM theorem (e.g., in the version proved\nin\u00a0<cit.>, which fits perfectly in this framework).  The\napplication of all this computational procedure allows us to prove our\nfinal result, that is summarized in the following statement.\n\n\n\n  Let us consider the Hamiltonian H^(5), expanded as\n  in\u00a0(<ref>) and truncated up to degree 2 in the\n  actions and to trigonometrical degree 12 in the angles.  Let\n  \u03c9^*\u2208^2 be such that\n  \n    \u03c9_1^*\u2208( -2.72805620345077182 \u00d7 10^-2,\n        -2.72805620345057182\u00d7 10^-2)\n       \u03c9_2^*\u2208( -3.0574227066998818 \u00d7 10^-1,\n        -3.0574227066978818 \u00d7 10^-1)\n\n  and it satisfies the Diophantine condition\n  \n    | k\u00b7\u03c9^*|\u2265\u03b3/| k|^\u03c4 ,\n          \u2200  k\u2208^2\u2216{0} ,\n\n  with \u03b3=2.7280562034505684\u00d7 10^-2 and \u03c4=1.\n  Therefore, there exists an analytic canonical transformation which\n  transforms the Hamiltonian H^(5) in the Kolmogorov normal\n  form\u00a0(<ref>). In the new action-angle coordinates, the\n  torus { p= 0 ,  q\u2208^2} is invariant and carries\n  quasi-periodic orbits whose corresponding angular velocity vector is\n  \u03c9^*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was partially supported by the MIUR-PRIN 20178CJA2B \u201cNew\nFrontiers of Celestial Mechanics: theory and Applications\u201d, by the\nMIUR Excellence Department Project awarded to the Department of\nMathematics of the University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d (CUP\nE83C18000100006) and by the National Group of Mathematical\nPhysics (GNFM-INdAM).\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nAlv-Mich-Mal-2016\n  A.J.\u00a0Alves, T.A.\u00a0Michtchenko, M.
